USMLE Step 3

The USMLE® Step 3 is one of the last steps one must take toward becoming a licensed physician. The exam assesses the extent to which one can apply med- ical knowledge to the unsupervised practice of medicine. For international medical graduates (IMGs) who are applying for residency training in the United States, it also represents an opportunity to strengthen the residency application. The Step 3 exam focuses on the initial and long-term manage- ment of common clinical problems in different settings.

In this section, we will provide an overview of the Step 3 exam and will offer you proven approaches toward conquering it. For a detailed description of Step 3, visit www.usmle.org or refer to the two booklets provided on the USMLE Web site: USMLE Step 3 Content Description and General Informa- tion and USMLE Step 3 Sample Test Questions.
======================================
H O W I S S T E P 3 S T R U C T U R E D ?

The Step 3 exam is administered on two separate days that need not be con- secutively scheduled. The first day of the exam covers the Foundations of Independent Practice. The second day emphasizes Advanced Clinical Medi- cine and is discussed in detail in the Primum® Computer-based Case Simula- tions (CCS) section.

Foundations of Independent Practice (FIP): Day 1 of testing lasts 7 hours and consists of six blocks of 38–40 multiple-choice questions for a total of 235 questions. Test takers are given a maximum of 60 minutes to complete each block. There is a 45-minute break as well as an optional 5-minute tutorial. Break time can be extended if a test taker skips the optional tutorial or finishes a test block early. Once you finish a test block, you cannot go back to it.

The content material on day 1 focuses on the basic principles required for the provision of effective health care. This includes basic foundational science (ie, knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of both normal and abnormal physiologic processes); knowledge of the history and PE, the diagnostic pro- cess, and use of studies in diagnosing diseases; the principles and interpreta- tion of biostatistics, epidemiology, and population health; and the application of social sciences, including interpersonal skills, medical ethics, systems-based practice, and patient safety, to the provision of health care. Also included on day 1 are items that test one’s ability to interpret the medical literature and pharmaceutical advertisements.

Advanced Clinical Medicine (ACM): Day 2 lasts approximately 9 hours and consists of six blocks of 30 multiple-choice questions for a total of 180 ques- tions. Test takers are given 45 minutes to complete each block. There is an optional 5-minute tutorial. Day 2 also includes a CCS component with 13 case simulations. Each case is allotted 10 or 20 minutes. There is also an optional 7-minute CCS tutorial and a 45-minute break. As on day 1, test tak- ers can add time to the break by completing a test block early or by skipping the optional tutorial. At the end of the day, there is an optional survey.

Day 2 of the exam focuses on the test taker’s ability to apply medical knowl- edge in the context of patient management and the evolving manifestations of disease over time. The test focuses on knowledge of medical decision making, diagnosis and management, and disease prognosis and outcome. Additional

emphasis is placed on screening and health maintenance management. Tables 1-1 and 1-2 graphically depict the areas of concentration of the revised Step 3 exam.
======================================
W H AT T Y P E S O F Q U E S T I O N S A R E A S K E D ?

Virtually all questions on Step 3 are case based. A substantial amount of extra- neous information may be given, or a clinical scenario may be followed by a question that one could answer without actually reading the case. It is your job to determine which information is superfluous and which is pertinent to the case at hand. There are three question formats:

■ Single items: This is the most frequent question type. It consists of the tra- ditional single-best-answer question with 4–5 choices.

■ Multiple-item sets: This consists of a clinical vignette followed by 2 or 3 questions regarding that case. These questions can be answered indepen- dently. Again, there is only one best answer.

■ Cases: This is a clinical vignette followed by 2–5 questions. You actually receive additional information as you answer questions, so it is important that you answer questions sequentially without skipping. As a result, once you proceed to the next question in the case, you cannot change the answer to the previous question.

T A B L E 1 - 2 . Step 3 Competencies Testeda
======================================
aThe competencies listed in rows 2–4 (Patient Care: Diagnosis and Management) are also tested on the CCS.

Questions are organized by clinical setting and include an outpatient office/ community health center, an inpatient hospital, and an ED. The clinical care situations you will encounter in these settings include:

■ Initial workup: This is characterized by the initial assessment and man- agement of clinical issues among patients typically seen in an outpatient setting.

■ Continuing care: This physician-patient encounter typically occurs in an ambulatory context but may also take place in an inpatient setting. The encounter focuses on the management of previously diagnosed conditions and issues surrounding health maintenance. Encounters are characterized by the evaluation and management of acute exacerbations or complica- tions of chronic and progressive medical illnesses.

■ Urgent intervention: This encounter tests the prompt recognition and management of life-threatening emergencies, typically in EDs or in the context of hospitalized patients.

When approaching vignette questions, you should keep a few things in mind:

■ Be sure to note the age and race of the patient in each clinical scenario. When ethnicity is given, it is often relevant. Know these associations well (see high-yield facts), especially for more common diagnoses. ■ Be able to recognize key facts that distinguish major diagnoses. ■ Questions often describe clinical findings rather than naming eponyms

(eg, they cite “audible hip click” instead of “positive Ortolani sign”).

Like the Step 1 and 2 score reports, your Step 3 report includes your pass/fail status, a score with a three-digit scale, and a graphical performance profile organized by discipline and disease process. A minimum score of 196 is required for passing. According to the USMLE, the mean score for first-time test takers from accredited US medical schools ranges from 222 to 225 with a standard deviation of approximately 16.

According to recent data from the USMLE Web site, approximately 98–100% of graduates from US and Canadian medical schools passed Step 3 on their first try, whereas 88% of IMGs passed on their first attempt. For detailed, year- to-year performance, visit www.usmle.org/performance-data/.
======================================
H O W D O I R E G I S T E R T O TA K E T H E E X A M ?

The process of registering for the Step 3 exam varies depending on whether you are a US or a Canadian-based medical student, an allopathic or osteo- pathic student, or a student living outside the United States or Canada. For US and Canadian medical students, application is made through the Web site of the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), www.fsmb.org. The regis- tration was $850 for eligibility periods ending in 2018. Note again that the 2 days of the exam do not need to be scheduled consecutively.

Your scheduling permit is sent via e-mail to the e-mail address provided on the application materials. Once you have received your scheduling permit, it is your responsibility to print it and decide when and where you would like to take the exam. To see a list of Prometric locations near you and to arrange a time to take the exam, call Prometric’s toll-free number or visit www.prometric.com.

The electronic scheduling permit you receive will contain the following important information:

■ Your USMLE identification number ■ The 90-day eligibility period in which you may take the exam ■ Your “scheduling number,” which you will need to make your exam

appointment with Prometric

■ Your Candidate Identification Number, or CIN, which you must enter at your Prometric workstation to access the exam

Prometric has no access to these codes or your scheduling permit and will not be able to supply them for you. You will not be allowed to take Step 3 unless you present your permit, printed ahead of time, along with an unex- pired, government-issued photo identification that contains your signature (eg, a driver’s license or passport). Make sure the name on your photo ID exactly matches the name that appears on your scheduling permit.

W H AT I F I N E E D T O R E S C H E D U L E T H E E X A M ?

You can change your date and/or center within your 3-month eligibility period at no charge by contacting Prometric, as long as you do so 31 or more days before your scheduled test date. A fee will apply if you reschedule between 5 and 30 days before your test date, and a larger fee will apply if you resched- ule less than 5 days before your test date. You may not reschedule your test the day before. If you need to re-schedule outside your initial eligibility period, you can apply for a single 3-month extension (eg, April/May/June can be extended

W H AT A B O U T T I M E ?

Time is of special interest on the exam. As you take the exam, the computer will keep track of how much time has elapsed. However, the computer will show you only how much time remains in a given test block, not how much time is left in the entire test (unless you look at the full clock by using the Alt-T command). Therefore, it is up to you to determine whether you are pac- ing yourself properly. Note that on both days of the exam, you have approxi- mately 75 seconds per multiple-choice question. If you feel that you can’t answer a question within a reasonable time, take an educated guess and move on, as there are no penalties for wrong answers.

It should be noted that a total of 45 minutes is allowed for break time. You choose how to allot those 45 minutes and you may take all 45 minutes at once or split the period into multiple breaks. However, you can elect not to use all of your break time, or you can gain extra break time either by skipping the tutorial or by finishing a block ahead of the allotted time. The computer will not warn you if you have used more than your allotted break time.
======================================
I F I L E A V E D U R I N G T H E E X A M , W H AT H A P P E N S T O M Y S C O R E ?

You are considered to have started the exam once you have entered your CIN onto the computer screen. For an official score to be recorded, however, you must finish the entire exam. This means that you must start an exam block and either finish it or run out of time. If you do not complete all the blocks, your USMLE score transcript will document your exam as an incomplete attempt, and no actual score will be reported.

The exam ends when all blocks have been completed or time has elapsed. As you leave the testing center, you will receive a written test-completion notice to document your completion of the exam.

H O W L O N G W I L L I H A V E T O W A I T B E F O R E I G E T M Y S C O R E S ?

The USMLE typically reports scores 3–4 weeks after the examinee’s test date. During peak periods, however, it may take up to 8 weeks for scores to be made available. Official information concerning the time required for score reporting is posted on the USMLE Web site.

Primum Computer-Based Case Simulations

This computerized patient simulation is administered on the second day of the Step 3 exam. You will be given 13 cases over 4 hours and will have up to 10 or 20 minutes to complete each case. As with the rest of the Step 3 exam, the CCS aims to test your ability to properly diagnose and manage common conditions in a variety of patient settings. Many of the conditions tested are obvious or easily diagnosed.

Clinical problems presented on the CCS may be acute or chronic and may range from mild to life-threatening. Cases may last anywhere from a few min- utes to a few months in simulated time, but you will be allotted only 10 or 20 minutes of real time to complete each. Regardless of the setting (eg, office, ED, ICU), you will serve as the patient’s primary physician and will assume complete responsibility for his or her care.

R E V I E W I N G A C A S E

If you wish to excel on the CCS, there is no substitute for downloading and trying out the sample cases from the USMLE Web site (www.usmle.org/ practice-materials/index.html). Devoting at least a few hours to these cases and familiarizing yourself with the CCS interface will improve your perfor- mance on the exam regardless of your level of computer expertise.

For each case, you will be presented with a chief complaint, vital signs, and a history of present illness (HPI). You will then initiate patient management, continue care, and advance the case by taking one of the following four actions represented on the computer screen:

1. Get interval history or PE. You can obtain either a focused or a full PE. You can also obtain an interval history to see how a patient is doing. Get- ting an interval history or performing a PE will automatically advance the clock in simulated time.

GUIDE TO THE USMLE STEP 3

Quick tips and shortcuts:

If the patient’s vital signs are unstable, remember that you may have to write some orders (eg, IV fluids, oxygen, type and cross-match) before per- forming the PE.

■ Remember to keep the PE focused. Conducting a full PE may be wasteful and may cost you valuable simulated time. You can always perform addi- tional exam components as they become necessary.

2. Write order or review chart. You can manage the patient by typing orders. For example, you can order tests, monitoring, treatments, procedures, con- sultations, and counseling. The order sheet on the CCS is formatted as free-text entry, so you can type whatever you choose; the computer has a 12,000-term vocabulary that can accommodate approximately 2500 orders or actions.

When you order a medication, you will also need to specify the route and fre- quency of administration. If a patient comes into a case with preexisting medi- cations, these meds will appear on the order sheet with an order time of “Day 1 @00:00.” The medications will continue to be administered unless you decide to cancel them. Unlike the interval history or PE, you must manu- ally advance simulated time to see the results of your orders.
======================================
Quick tips and shortcuts:

■ As long as the computer can recognize the first three characters of your order, it can provide a list of orders from which to choose.

■ When inputting an order, simply type the name of the test, therapy, or procedure you wish to obtain. Don’t type verbs such as “get,” “administer,” or “do.”

■ Complete the sample cases to get a sense of the types of abbreviations that the computer will recognize (eg, CBC, CXR, ECG).

■ Familiarize yourself with the routes of administration and dosing frequen- cies of common medications. You do not need to know dosages or drip rates.

■ Never assume that other health care staff or consultants will write orders for you. On the contrary, you are responsible for writing all orders, includ- ing routine actions such as IV fluids, oxygen, monitoring, and diabetic diet. If a patient is preoperative, don’t forget NPO, type and cross-match, and antibiotics if necessary.

■ You can always change your mind about an order and cancel it as long as the clock has not advanced.

■ Review any preexisting medications on the order sheet. Sometimes the patient’s problem may be due to a preexisting medication adverse effect or a drug interaction!

3. Obtain results or see patient later. To determine how a given case evolves after you have entered your orders, you must advance the clock. You can specify a time to see the patient either in the future or when the next results become available. Upon advancing the clock, you may receive mes- sages from the patient, family, or health care staff updating you on the patient’s status before the specified time or results are made available. If you stop a clock advance to a future time (eg, a follow-up appointment) to review results from previous orders, that future event will be canceled.

10/5/18 11:30 AM

GUIDE TO THE USMLE STEP 3

Quick tips and shortcuts:

■ Before advancing the clock, ask yourself whether the patient will be stable during that time period. Also ask yourself whether the patient is in the appropriate location or whether he or she should be transferred to another setting. If you receive an update while the clock is advancing, be sure to review your current management, especially if the patient’s condition is worsening.

4. Change location. In the simulated exam, you will have an outpatient office with admitting privileges to a 400-bed tertiary-care facility. As in real life, the patient will typically present to you in either an office or an ED. Once you’ve done all you can for the patient, you can elect to transfer him or her to another setting, such as the ward or the ICU, for appropriate care. Note that in the context of the CCS, “ICU” is a blanket term that encompasses all types of intensive care, including medical, surgical, pedi- atric, obstetrics, and neonatal. Where appropriate, the patient may be dis- charged home with follow-up.

Quick tips and shortcuts:

■ Always ask yourself if the patient is in the right setting to receive optimal management.

■ Remember that you will remain the patient’s primary physician regardless of where he or she goes.

■ When changing locations (and especially when discharging the patient), remember to discontinue orders that are no longer needed.

■ Remember that patients who are discharged home will require a follow-up appointment.

■ Before discharging a patient, think about whether he or she needs any health maintenance or counseling.
======================================
F I N I S H I N G T H E C A S E

On the CCS, each case ends when you have used up your allotted 10 or 20 minutes. If the measurement objectives for the case have already been met before this period has elapsed, the computer may ask you to exit early. Toward the end, you will be given a warning that the case is about to conclude. You will then be given an opportunity to cancel existing orders as well as to write new short-term orders. You will be asked for a final diagnosis before exiting.

H O W I S T H E C C S G R A D E D ?

Your grade will be determined by a scoring algorithm that is based on gener- ally accepted practices of care. This algorithm allows for wide variation and recognizes that there may be more than one appropriate way to approach a case. In general, you will gain points for appropriate management actions and will lose points for actions that are not indicated or are potentially harmful to your patient. These actions are weighted such that key actions (eg, ordering an emergent needle thoracostomy for a patient with tension pneumothorax) will earn you a comparatively greater number of points, whereas highly inap- propriate actions (eg, ordering a liver biopsy for a patient with an ear infec- tion) will cost you relatively more points.

GUIDE TO THE USMLE STEP 3

Note, however, that even if your management actions are correct, you may not be given full credit for them if you perform them out of sequence or fol- lowing an inappropriate delay in simulated time. Unnecessary or excessive orders—even if they pose no risk to the patient—will cost you points as well. The bottom line is that the CCS tends to reward thorough but efficient medicine.
======================================
H I G H - Y I E L D S T R AT E G I E S F O R T H E C C S

As mentioned earlier, it is essential that you practice the sample CCS cases before taking the actual exam. Make sure you do both outpatient and inpa- tient cases. Try different abbreviations to get a feel for the vocabulary you should use when you write orders. You can also apply different approaches toward the same case to see how the computer reacts.

Read through the 100 cases in Chapter 19, High-Yield CCS Cases. They will show you how clinical conditions can present and play out in the CCS. Remember that the computer wants you to do the right things at the right times while incurring minimal waste and risk to the patient. When taking the exam, also bear the following in mind:

■ Read the HPI carefully. Use the HPI to develop a short differential that will direct your PE and initial management. Often the diagnosis will become apparent to you before you begin the PE. Jot down pertinent posi- tives and negatives so that you don’t have to come back and review the chart. Keep in mind any drug allergies that the patient might have.

■ Remember that unstable patients need immediate management. If a patient’s vital signs are unstable, you may want to take some basic manage- ment measures, such as administering IV fluids and oxygen, before start- ing the PE. With unstable patients, your goal should be to order tests that will help identify and manage the patient’s underlying condition while incurring minimal delay.

■ Consultants are rarely helpful. Although you will earn some points for calling a consultant for an indicated procedure (eg, a surgeon for an appendectomy), consultants will generally offer little in the way of diag- nostic or management assistance.

■ Don’t forget health maintenance, education, and counseling. After treating tension pneumothorax, counsel the patient about smoking cessa- tion if the HPI mentions that he or she is an active smoker.

■ Don’t treat the patient alone. The computer will not permit you to treat a patient’s family or sexual partner, but it will allow you to provide education or counseling. If a female patient is of childbearing age, check a preg- nancy test before starting a potentially teratogenic treatment.

■ Some patients will worsen despite good care, while others will improve despite poor management. If a case is not going your way, reassess your approach to make sure you’re not missing anything. If you’re confident about your diagnosis and management strategy, stop second-guessing it. Sometimes the CCS tests your ability to handle difficult clinical situations.

Basic Principles

Be familiar with the following principles:

■ Autonomy: The right to make decisions for oneself in accordance with one’s own system of morals and beliefs.

■ Paternalism: Providing for your perception of patients’ needs without their input.

5

KEY FACT

Patients have the right to refuse care as long as they can understand and articulate the risks and benefits.

■ Beneficence: Action intended to bring about a good outcome. ■ Nonmaleficence: Action not intended to bring about harm. ■ Truth telling: Revealing all pertinent information to patients. ■ Proportionality: Ensuring that a medical treatment or plan is commensu-

rate with the illness and with the goals of treatment.

■ Distributive justice: Allocation of resources in a manner that is fair and just, though not necessarily equal.

|_|

Autonomy

I N F O R M E D C O N S E N T

Involves discussing diagnoses and prognoses with patients as well as any pro- posed treatment, its risks and benefits, and its alternatives. Only with such information can a patient reach an informed decision. Do not conceal a diag- nosis from a patient, as doing so would violate the principle of truth telling. However, respect your patients’ wishes if they ask you to share only certain things with them. Under emergent circumstances, if a patient’s wishes are unknown, consent is implied.

R I G H T S O F M I N O R S

The treatment of patients < 18 years of age requires parental consent unless:

■ They are emancipated (ie, financially independent, married, pregnant, raising children, living on their own, or serving in the armed forces).

■ They are requesting contraception or treatment of pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, or psychiatric illness. Note that many states require parental consent or notice for termination of pregnancy in a minor.

Most Step 3 exam questions on parental consent will deal with situations such as those cited above. In general, this means that for the Step 3 exam, the gov- erning principle should be to let minors make their own decisions.
======================================
|_| Competency

Competency

C O M P E T E N C Y V S C A PA C I T Y

The terms “competency” and “capacity” should not be used interchangeably. Competency is a legal determination made only by a court, whereas capacity is a clinical assessment. Both capacity and competency involve the doctor’s assessment of a patient’s ability to think, reason, and act rationally (though not necessarily wisely). Incapacity may be temporary and situational; it is applied to a specific clinical question/scenario (eg, “can the patient refuse a platelet infusion despite his untreated schizoaffective disorder”) and is not broadly

assigned (eg, “this patient does not have capacity”). Incompetence is more permanent (eg, severe dementia), and incompetent patients are generally assigned a surrogate or guardian by the court.

D E T E N T I O N A N D U S E O F R E S T R A I N T S

Psychiatric patients may be involuntarily hospitalized only if they are a dan- ger to themselves or to others (in accordance with the principle of benefi- cence). The use of restraints can be considered if a patient is at risk of doing harm to self or others, but such use must be evaluated on at least a daily basis.

D U R A B L E P O W E R O F AT T O R N E Y F O R H E A LT H C A R E

Durable power of attorney (DPoA) has two related meanings. First, it can refer to a document signed by the patient assigning a surrogate decision maker if he or she becomes incapacitated. Second, it can refer to the person to whom that authority has been granted.

S U R R O G AT E / P R O X Y

A surrogate or proxy is defined as an alternate decision maker who is desig- nated by the patient (or DPoA) and charged with making decisions in accor- dance with the patient’s preferences.

|_| Confidentiality

Confidentiality

I M P O R TA N C E O F C O N F I D E N T I A L I T Y ( A N D H I PA A )

Maintaining the confidentiality of patient information is critical. Violations are unethical, may have legal implications, and may irreparably harm the patient- physician relationship. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) outlines rules and guidelines for preserving patient privacy.
======================================
W H E N T O V I O L AT E C O N F I D E N T I A L I T Y

If a physician learns about a threat to an individual’s life or well-being (ie, a danger to self or to others), violating confidentiality is mandatory. In a similar manner, information about child abuse or elder abuse must be reported. Inti- mate partner violence is not a mandated reportable condition.

R E P O R TA B L E C O N D I T I O N S

The list of reportable conditions varies by state but often includes HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, TB, mumps, measles, rubella, smallpox, and suspected bioterrorist events. Such reporting is mandatory, is anonymous, and does not constitute a violation of patient confidentiality.

A S K I N G F O L L O W - U P Q U E S T I O N S

Follow-up questions should be used to clarify unclear issues, such as which family members can be included in discussions of care, who is the primary surrogate, and what patients want to know about their own conditions.

KEY FACT

Capacity can be assessed by any doctor, but it often becomes a psychiatric consult if unclear.

A 22-year-old Jehovah’s Witness presents with GI bleeding but states that he does not want a blood transfusion. His hematocrit falls from 40 to 22%, and his BP falls as well. The patient is urged to accept lifesaving treatments but refuses. When his BP reaches a critical level, one of his physicians initiates plans to transfuse. The rest of the team vetoes the plan. What ethical principles are involved, and which principle trumps the other?

End-of-Life Care

5

KEY FACT

The Elisabeth Kübler-Ross psychological stages at the end of life are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

Patients in the end stages of a terminal illness have the right to obtain medical treatment that is intended to preserve human dignity in dying. The best means of reaching an agreement with the patient and family regarding end-of- life care is to continue to talk about the patient’s condition and to resolve decision-making conflicts. Ultimately, this is the same task that an ethics con- sultant would attempt to perform for the physician and the patient.

There is a growing body of literature addressing the importance of cultural issues in end-of-life care. In the United States, emphasis is placed on patient autonomy, full disclosure of medical information, and shared decision mak- ing. However, members of other cultures may lend more credibility to family- based decisions, particular methods of diagnosis communication, and the importance of subjective aspects of illness. It is important to elicit and respect these cultural frameworks and dynamics in end-of-life care.
======================================
A D V A N C E D I R E C T I V E S

Advance directives are oral or written instructions regarding what a patient would want in the event that the patient loses capacity to make health-care decisions. These instructions can be detailed or broad. Oral statements are ethically binding but are not legally binding in all states. Remember that an informed, competent adult can refuse treatment even if it means that doing so would lead to death. Such instructions must be honored.

D O N O T R E S U S C I TAT E O R D E R S / C O D E S TAT U S

5

KEY FACT

Do not resuscitate ≠ do not treat!

The express wishes of a patient (eg, “I do not want to be intubated”) super- sede the wishes of family members or surrogates. Physicians should inquire about and follow DNR orders during each hospitalization. If code status has not been addressed and the matter becomes relevant, defer to the surrogate.

PA I N I N T E R M I N A L LY I L L PAT I E N T S

Terminally ill patients are often inadequately treated for pain. Prescribe as much narcotic and non-narcotic medication as needed to relieve patients’ pain and suffering. Do not worry about addiction in this setting. Two thirds of termi- nally ill patients reported moderate to severe pain in the last 3 days of life.

T H E P R I N C I P L E O F “ D O U B L E E F F E C T ”

Actions can have more than one consequence, some intended, others not. Unintended medical consequences are acceptable if the intended conse- quences are legitimate and the harm proportionately smaller than the benefit. For example, a dying patient can be given high doses of analgesics even if it may unintentionally shorten life.

This is a conflict between beneficence and autonomy. The physician aims to bring a good outcome for the patient (beneficence), but the patient is deciding in accordance with his belief system (autonomy). The principle of autonomy trumps beneficence in this situation.

Defined as a state in which the brainstem is intact, and the patient has sleep- wake cycles, but there is no awareness, voluntary activity, or ability to interact with the environment.

Quality of life refers to a subjective evaluation of a patient’s current physical, emotional, and social well-being. This must be evaluated from the perspective of the patient.

P H Y S I C I A N - A S S I S T E D S U I C I D E A N D E U T H A N A S I A

Physician-assisted suicide is currently legal only in six states (WA, OR, MT, VT, CA, CO) and refers to physicians prescribing medication to hasten death. Each state has slightly different criteria; generally, patients must be informed and competent, have a prognosis of 6 months or less, and must be able to self- administer the drug. Euthanasia refers to the physician directly participating in the administration of medication to end life.

PA L L I AT I O N A N D H O S P I C E

Palliative care focuses on reducing symptom burden and improving quality of life for patients with serious medical conditions, such as cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A patient may still undergo treatment with curative intent and receive palliative care. Hospice is a related specialty that focuses on providing this care in patients who are no longer receiving curative treatment. Both involve interdisciplinary collaboration (MD, RN, chaplain, social worker) to manage the patient’s psychosocial and physical well-being in a manner that preserves dignity and maximizes comfort.

W I T H D R A W A L O F T R E AT M E N T

Withdrawal of treatment is the removal of life-sustaining treatment and is legally and ethically no different from never starting treatment. The decision to withdraw treatment may come from the patient, an advance directive, a DPoA, or—absent any of these—the patient’s closest relative and/or a physi- cian. It is easiest when all parties are in agreement, although this is not required. When there is conflict, the patient’s wishes take precedence. In futile cases or those involving extreme suffering, a physician may withdraw or withhold treatment; if the family disagrees, the physician should seek input from an ethics committee or obtain a court’s approval.

|_| Biostatistics

Biostatistics

Not everyone with a given disease will test positive for that disease, and not everyone with a positive test result has the disease.

S E N S I T I V I T Y A N D S P E C I F I C I T Y

Sensitivity is the probability that a person with a disease will have a positive result on a test (true positive rate). Specificity is the probability that a person without the disease will have a negative result on a test (true negative rate). High specificity is desirable for a confirmatory test.

Ideally, a test will be highly sensitive and specific, but this is rare. A test that is highly sensitive but not specific will yield many false positives, whereas one that is highly specific but not sensitive will yield many false negatives.

Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a person with a positive test result has the disease (true positives/all positives; see Table 6-1). If a dis- ease has a greater prevalence, then the PPV is higher. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that a person with a negative test result is dis- ease free (see Table 6-1). A test has a higher NPV value when a disease has a lower prevalence. It is important to note that PPV and NPV can be deter- mined only if the incidence in the sample is representative of the population. For example, if the data for Table 6-1 are derived from a case-control study, then the PPV and NPV cannot be calculated. Generally, one needs a cohort study design to get PPV or NPV.

RR is used in prospective studies to calculate risk of developing a disease with a particular exposure. OR is used in retrospective studies to look at who has the exposure from among those who are known to have the disease.

Used to evaluate the results of cohort (prospective) studies. The relative risk (RR) compares the incidence of a disease in a group exposed to a particular risk factor with the incidence in those not exposed to the risk factor (see Table 6-2). An RR < 1 means that the event is less likely in the exposed group; conversely, an RR > 1 signifies that the event is more likely in that group.

O D D S R AT I O

a.

Very helpful. Both positive and negative results make significant changes in disease probability and can confirm or disprove a diagnosis. This is the situation in which a laboratory test is most helpful. The test would not be helpful for a disease prevalence of 1%; most of the positives will be false positives, so further evaluation will be necessary. It would not be helpful for a disease prevalence of 90%; the positive result adds nothing to your clinical suspicion, and a negative test is likely to be a false negative.

Used in case-control (retrospective) studies. The odds ratio (OR) compares the rate of exposure among those with and without a disease (see Table 6-2). It is considered less accurate than RR, but in rare diseases the OR approximates the RR.

Measures the risk accounted for by exposure to a given factor, taking into account the background of the disease. It is useful in randomized controlled tri- als. Numerically, absolute risk reduction (ARR) = the absolute risk (rate of adverse events) in the placebo group minus the absolute risk in treated patients.

R E L AT I V E R I S K R E D U C T I O N

Also used in randomized controlled trials; this is the ratio between two risks. Numerically, relative risk reduction (RRR) = [the event rate in control patients minus the event rate in experimental patients] plus the event rate in control patients.

RRR can be deceptive and is clinically far less important than ARR. Con- sider a costly intervention that reduces the risk of an adverse event from 0.01% to 0.004%. ARR is 0.01 − 0.004 = 0.006%, but RRR is (0.01 − 0.004)/0.01 = 0.6, or 60%! Would you order this intervention?

Like the P value, the confidence interval (CI) expresses the certainty that the observation is real or is a product of random chance. Used with ORs and RR, the 95% CI indicates that the observed risk or odds have a 95% chance of being within the interval. Thus, in Figure 6-1, the RR of cancer with smoking is 2.0 with a 95% CI of 1.3–3.5—meaning that the observed RR of cancer was 2.0, and there is a 95% certainty that the actual RR of cancer from smoking falls somewhere between 1.3 and 3.5.

Study Design

Statistical analyses are used as a means of assessing relationships between events and outcomes. They do not prove irrefutably that a relationship exists but point to the likelihood of this being the case. The validity of the results depends on the strength of the design.

KEY FACT

ARR and RRR give different values and should not be confused. ARR is a much better measure of benefit; because it is a ratio, RRR can look deceptively large. Watch out for drug advertising that touts RRR.

KEY FACT

If a 95% CI includes 1.0, the results are not significant. Therefore, if an RR is 1.9, but the 95% CI is 0.8–3.0, the RR is not significant.

Self-reports of symptoms, exposures, feelings, and other subjective data. Such data may be analyzed with descriptive statistics or qualitative methodologies.

P R O S P E C T I V E A N D R E T R O S P E C T I V E S T U D I E S

■ Prospective studies assess future outcomes relating to present or future events; this enables the study designer to control for bias and to modify inputs/exposures.

■ Retrospective studies relate to outcomes from past events. They may be less reliable than prospective studies.

C O H O R T S T U D I E S

In a cohort study (see Figure 6-2), a population is observed over time, grouped by exposure to a particular factor, and watched for a specific out- come. Such studies are not good for rare conditions. Studies can be prospec- tive or retrospective. Use RR to interpret results. Examples include the Nurses’ Health Study and the Framingham Heart Study.

C A S E - C O N T R O L S T U D I E S

A case-control study (see Figure 6-3) is a retrospective study involving a group of people with a given disease and an otherwise similar group of people with- out the disease who are compared for exposure to risk factors. Case-control studies are good for rare diseases. Use OR to interpret results.

GASTROENTEROLOGY

Esophageal Pathology

Broadly defined as dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing food.

History/PE Patients may complain of food that “sticks” or “hangs up.” May have associ- ated odynophagia (pain with swallowing).

DiffErEntial If difficulty is with solids alone, consider the following:

■ Lower esophageal ring (Schatzki ring): Characterized by intermittent symptoms or sudden obstruction with a food bolus due to an esophageal stricture, often associated with a hiatal hernia.

■ Zenker diverticulum: Outpouching above the upper esophageal sphinc- ter. Presents with foul-smelling breath and food regurgitation.

■ Plummer-Vinson syndrome: Triad of dysphagia, cervical esophageal webs, and iron-deficiency anemia. Associated with esophageal cancer. ■ Peptic stricture: Progressive symptoms with long-standing heartburn (see

Figure 7-1A).

■ Carcinoma: Progressive symptoms in an older patient, often with weight

loss. ■ Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): ↑ Risk with tobacco, ethanol, poor

diet.

■ Adenocarcinoma: ↑ Risk with tobacco, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), poor diet.

■ Esophagitis: Inflammation can be 2° to a number of causes:

■ Gastroesophageal reflux: Reflux of acid and stomach contents through the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

■ Pill esophagitis: Usually caused by taking a pill with little or no fluid before lying down. Associated medications: doxycycline, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates.

■ Opportunistic infections: Candida, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Usually occur in immunocompromised patients (eg, HIV, chemotherapy, diabetes).

■ Eosinophilic esophagitis: Chronic inflammatory disease mediated by IL-5. Usually found in young men with a history of respiratory allergies.

If difficulty is with both solids and liquids, consider:

■ Achalasia: Progressive symptoms that worsen at night with no heartburn. Look for a “bird’s beak” on barium swallow (see Figure 7-1B).

■ Esophageal spasm: Intermittent symptoms with chest pain. Triggered by acid, stress, and hot and cold liquids. Diagnosed by esophageal manome- try. Look for “corkscrew esophagus” on barium swallow (see Figure 7-1C). ■ Scleroderma: Progressive symptoms with heartburn and Raynaud phe- nomenon. Lower esophageal pressure and aperistalsis of the distal esopha- gus leads to reflux (CREST syndrome: Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia).

Diagnosis Workup includes esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and/or barium swallow.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

Results when the LES is weakened by ↑ pressure or ↓ tone. Risk factors include:

■ ↑ Pressure: Hiatal hernia, obesity, collagen vascular disease, pregnancy. ■ ↓ Tone: Alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, chocolate, fatty foods.

History/PE ■ Presents with a burning sensation beneath the sternum. ■ Symptoms usually worsen after meals, on reclining, and with tight clothes.

DiffErEntial Cardiovascular causes of chest pain, esophageal motility disorders, peptic ulcer.

Diagnosis For classic symptoms, diagnosis is usually based on response to treatment. EGD and ambulatory pH monitoring are warranted only if therapy fails.

trEatmEnt ■ Lifestyle modification: Elevate the head of the bed; avoid cigarettes and

NSAIDs; promote weight loss.

■ Drugs: Prescribe antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). If symptomatic relief is achieved with an H2 blocker or a PPI, discontinua- tion of treatment after 8–12 weeks may be successful.

■ Other: ■

If refractory to medical therapy, consider evaluation for Nissen fundo- plication or hiatal hernia repair.

■ Further workup (usually EGD) is warranted for signs or symptoms of more serious disease (eg, weight loss, anemia, heme ⊕ stools, signs of obstruction, advanced age [especially white men > 45 years]).

GASTROENTEROLOGY

Peptic Ulcer Disease

The most common sites of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) are the stomach and duodenum. Helicobacter pylori infection and NSAID use are the most com- mon causes. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, HSV and CMV infections, and cocaine use are less common etiologies.

History/PE ■ PUD presents with “gnawing” or “aching” epigastric pain. ■ Advanced disease may present with upper GI bleeding, perforation, or penetration into adjacent structures (eg, the pancreas, vascular structures such as the superior mesenteric artery, and the bile ducts), leading to hemodynamic instability and associated symptoms such as pancreatitis.

■ Symptoms are often distinguished by disease site: ■ Duodenal ulcers: Pain is relieved by eating. ■ Gastric ulcers: Pain worsens with food.

■ Red flags: Advanced age (> 55 years), dysphagia, persistent vomiting, ane- mia, GI bleeding (heme + stool), abdominal masses, lymphadenopathy, unintended weight loss, and family history of GI cancer.

Diagnosis ■ For healthy patients < 55 years of age without alarm symptoms, assess

response to treatment.

■ Look for H pylori infection in patients < 55 years of age with active PUD, history of PUD, or history of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lym- phoma or gastric cancer. ■ Urea breath test: Detects active infection and resolution 4-6 weeks after treatment; patients must be off PPIs for 2 weeks and off antibiotics and bismuth for 4 weeks.

■ Fecal antigen test: Useful for initial diagnosis and detecting resolution of infection, but as above, patients must be off antibiotics, PPIs, and bismuth; false positives and false negatives possible after treatment and with hematochezia.

■ Serum antibody: Detects IgG to H pylori but cannot distinguish active from treated infection.

■

In older patients, those unresponsive to treatment, or with any alarm symp- toms, consider EGD.

■ Benign appearing ulcers—smooth and round edge, flat base, exudate—do not need to be biopsied.

trEatmEnt ■ Discontinue aspirin and NSAIDs; promote smoking cessation and encour-

age weight loss.

■ Give PPIs to control symptoms, ↓ acid secretion, and heal the ulcer. ■ For H pylori infection, initiate multidrug therapy. Two of the following drugs may be used—amoxicillin, clarithromycin, or metronidazole— along with a PPI (omeprazole, lansoprazole) for 10–14 days. Indications for surgery include recurrent/refractory upper GI bleed, gastric outlet obstruction, recurrent/refractory ulcers, perforation, and Zollinger- Ellison syndrome.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Describes two distinct chronic idiopathic inflammatory diseases: Crohn dis- ease and ulcerative colitis (see Table 7-1 and Figures 7-3 and 7-4).

ecation. Pain poorly localized, migratory, and variable in nature. Intermittent diarrhea or constipation.

■ ■ May also present with a feeling of incomplete rectal evacuation, urgency,

passage of mucus, and bloating.

Diagnosis ■ A diagnosis of exclusion is based primarily on the history and physical exam. Basic labs to exclude other causes should include CBC, basic meta- bolic panel, calcium, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and stool ova and parasites (O&P).

■ The Rome IV criteria, used for symptomatic diagnosis, define IBS as recur- rent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months, associated with two or more of the following: ■ Related to defecation. ■ Associated with a change in frequency of stool. ■ Associated with a change in the form/appearance of stool.

5B

KEY FACT

Melena is suggestive of, though not exclusive to, an upper GI bleed. Hematochezia is suggestive of, though not exclusive to, a lower GI bleed. Consider GI transit time.

Diagnosis ■ Assess the severity of the bleed beginning with patient stabilization. ■ Check hematocrit (may be normal in acute blood loss), platelet count, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT), and liver func- tion tests (LFTs). ↑ blood urea nitrogen indicates digestion of blood. Type and screen early. If perforation is suspected, obtain upright and abdominal x-rays or a CT scan.

■ ■ Endoscopy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

trEatmEnt ■ Start by stabilizing the patient. Use at least two large-bore peripheral IV catheters. Transfusion and intravascular volume replacement can be initi- ated if indicated. Treat empirically with a PPI (can be stopped later if not appropriate).

■ Consult GI and surgery if bleeding does not stop or if difficulty is encoun- tered with resuscitation 2° to a brisk bleed.

■ Treat variceal bleeds with octreotide, PPIs, endoscopy band ligation, or sclerotherapy. If the bleed is severe, balloon tamponade is appropriate, fol- lowed by embolization, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), or a surgical shunt if endoscopic therapy fails.

■ To prevent variceal bleeds, treat patients with known varices with nonse- lective β-blockers (eg, propranolol), obliterative endoscopic therapy, shunting. Consider evaluation for liver transplant in cases of underlying cirrhosis as definitive treatment.

■ For PUD, use PPIs, endoscopic epinephrine injection, thermal contact, and ligation with clip placement. Evaluate and treat for H pylori.

■ Mallory-Weiss tears usually stop bleeding spontaneously. ■ Treat esophagitis/gastritis with PPIs and avoidance of inciting causes (aspi-

rin, NSAIDs, alcohol, bisphosphonates).
======================================
Lower GI Bleed

Bleeding that is distal to the ligament of Treitz. Causes include enteritis, mesen- teric ischemia, infectious or ischemic colitis, Meckel diverticulum, angiodyspla- sia, IBD, carcinoma, diverticulosis, polyps, hemorrhoids, and diverticulosis.

History/PE ■ Presents with hematochezia. ■ Diarrhea, tenesmus, bright red blood per rectum, and maroon-colored

stools are also seen.

9/27/18 4:02 PM

GASTROENTEROLOGY

■ As with upper GI bleeds, check vital signs to assess the severity of the bleed. Obtain orthostatics; perform a rectal exam for hemorrhoids, fis- sures, or a mass.

Diagnosis ■ Bleeding usually stops spontaneously; however, colonoscopy should be performed. If the bleed continues, a nuclear medicine scan (99Tc-tagged RBC scan) can be done to detect bleeding if it is > 1.0 mL/min. If the bleed is refractory and significant, arteriography or exploratory lapa- rotomy may be done.

■

trEatmEnt Although bleeding generally ceases spontaneously, resuscitative efforts should be initiated until the source is found and the bleeding stops.

|_| Pancreatitis

Pancreatitis

Inflammation of the pancreas that is thought to be caused by the release of excessive pancreatic enzymes. Can be acute or chronic. Etiologies include:

■ Acute disease:

■ Gallstones and alcohol: Account for 70–80% of acute cases. ■ Other causes: Obstruction (pancreatic or ampullary tumors), meta- bolic factors (severe hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia), abdominal trauma, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), infection (mumps, CMV, clonorchiasis, ascariasis), drugs (thiazides, azathioprine, pentamidine, sulfonamides), smoking, genetic mutations. ■ Chronic disease: Alcohol, cystic fibrosis, a history of severe pancreatitis,

idiopathic causes (excluding gallstones).

History/PE ■ Pancreatitis presents with abdominal pain—typically mid-epigastric—that

radiates to the back. The pain may be relieved by sitting forward.

■ Nausea, vomiting, and fever are also common. ■ Exam reveals mid-epigastric tenderness, guarding, occasionally jaundice,

and fever.

■ Cullen sign (periumbilical ecchymoses) and Grey Turner sign (flank ecchymoses) reflect retroperitoneal hemorrhage and severe pancreatitis, although they are often seen long after symptoms manifest and the diagno- sis has been made.

Diagnosis ■ Acute pancreatitis: Often diagnosed by presence by two of the following:

■ Characteristic abdominal pain. ■ Serum lipase and/or amylase > 3X the upper limit of normal. ■ Abdominal imaging with characteristic findings (see Figure 7-7).

■ Chronic pancreatitis: May not demonstrate lipase/amylase elevation because of diffuse fibrosis.

■ ↑ ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase levels suggest gallstone pancreatitis. ■ Ultrasound may show gallstones, a dilated common bile duct, or sludge in

trEatmEnt ■ Acute:

■ Supportive: NPO, IV fluids (patients may need large quantities), and pain management. In the setting of gallstone pancreatitis, ERCP with sphincterotomy is appropriate with common bile duct obstruction or with evidence of cholangitis. If the gallstone has passed, perform a cho- lecystectomy once the patient is sufficiently stable for surgery.

■ Antibiotics are useful only when there is suspicion for an infected necrotic pancreas (10% of cases; can be seen on CT). Treat with imipe- nem monotherapy or a fluoroquinolone + metronidazole.

■ Resume diet once pain and nausea have abated. Enteral feeding is preferable to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if nutritional support is needed in patients with protracted pancreatitis.

Approach to Liver Function Tests

The algorithm in Figure 7-8 outlines a general approach toward the interpre- tation of LFTs.

Gallstone Disease

Gallstones can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the United States, they are usually cholesterol stones; hemolytic disorders are associated with pigment stones. Gallstones can provoke cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) or cholangitis (inflammation of the common bile duct). In trauma patients, burn patients, or those on TPN, acute cholecystitis may occur in the absence of stones (acalculous cholecystitis).

History/PE ■ Most patients with gallstones are asymptomatic. ■ May also present as follows:

■ Biliary colic: Characterized by episodes of right upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain that may radiate to the right shoulder. Pain is usually postprandial, lasts about 30 minutes, and is occasionally accom- panied by vomiting. Nocturnal pain that awakens the patient is com- mon. Biliary colic is associated with fatty food intolerance and the Murphy sign (inspiratory arrest during deep palpation of the RUQ). ■ Cholangitis: Suggested by fever, jaundice (a sign of common bile duct

obstruction), and persistent RUQ pain (Charcot triad).

■ Reynolds pentad: Charcot triad plus shock and altered mental status may be seen in suppurative cholangitis.

======================================
KEY FACT

Symptoms of cholangitis: ■ RUQ pain. ■ Fever. ■

Risk factors for cholecystitis—

Diagnosis ■ Labs reveal leukocytosis and ↑ LFTs. ■ Ultrasound is 85–90% sensitive for gallbladder gallstones and cholecystitis (echogenic focus that casts a shadow; pericholecystic fluid = acute chole- cystitis). A thickened gallbladder wall and biliary sludge are less specific findings (see Figure 7-9). If ultrasound is equivocal and suspicion for acute cholecystitis is high, pro- ceed to a hepato-iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan. A ⊝ HIDA indicates no obstruction in the gallbladder. False positives are common.

Viral and Nonviral Hepatitis

May be acute or chronic, self-limited symptomatic; may not be detected until years after the initial infection.

History/PE ■

In acute cases, patients may present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mal- aise, and fever, but are frequently asymptomatic.

■ Exam is often normal but may reveal an enlarged and tender liver, dark urine, and jaundice.

DiffErEntial ■ With a high level of transaminase elevation (> 10–20 times the upper limit of normal), consider acute viral infection as well as ischemia (“shock liver”), acute choledocholithiasis, autoimmune hepatitis, or toxic exposure (acetaminophen).

■ With moderate transaminase elevation, consider the most common cause, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Also consider chronic viral infection, mononucleosis, CMV, 2° syphilis, drug-induced illness, alcohol, Budd- Chiari syndrome, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, IBD, right-sided heart failure, and muscle damage (eg, rhabdomyolysis).

Diagnosis ■ Clinical presentation in the setting of ↑ transaminases. ■ Conduct serology and/or PCR testing to confirm a specific virus (see Fig-

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a common cause of liver disease in patients with obesity and diabetes. Other causes of liver disease, such as hepatitis and alcoholism, should be excluded.

Cirrhosis and Ascites

Chronic irreversible changes of the hepatic parenchyma, including fibrosis and regenerative nodules. The most common cause in the United States is alcohol abuse, followed by chronic viral hepatitis.

History/PE ■ May be asymptomatic for long periods. Symptoms reflect the severity of

hepatic damage, not the etiology (see Figure 7-11).

Diagnosis ■ Cirrhosis, while a tissue diagnosis, is often diagnosed using clinical evi- dence of disease such as ascites, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. It may be evaluated as follows: ■ Labs: ALT/AST may be elevated or normal as fibrotic tissue eventually replaces normal liver parenchyma. Additional lab findings include pan- cytopenia, prolonged PT and elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR), hyponatremia, and elevated ammonia.

Imaging: Ultrasound may be used to evaluate for liver size, nodularity, and echogenicity.

■

■ Ascites, if present, can be evaluated with paracentesis: Check cell count, differential, albumin, and bacterial cultures +/− acid-fast stain and +/− cytology. The etiology of the ascites can be further characterized as follows: ■ Related to portal hypertension (serum-ascites albumin gradient [SAAG] ≥ 1.1): Cirrhosis, heart failure, Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis).

■ Unrelated to portal hypertension (SAAG < 1.1): Peritonitis (eg, TB), cancer, pancreatitis, trauma, nephrotic syndrome.

■

If a patient with cirrhosis and ascites presents with worsening ascites, fever, altered mental status, renal dysfunction, or abdominal pain, consider spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

trEatmEnt ■ Cirrhosis is treated as follows: ■ Abstinence from alcohol. ■ Restriction of fluid intake (1-1.5 L) if hyponatremic. ■ Rifaximin and lactulose with hepatic encephalopathy. ■ Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment in the setting of pro-

gressive liver disease.

■ Treatment for ascites includes the following:

■ Restrict sodium to < 2 g/day. ■ Treat with diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone). ■ Obtain large-volume paracentesis for ascites refractory to diuretics. ■ TIPS can be used in refractory cases caused by portal hypertension, but

this will predispose to encephalopathy.

■ Again, liver transplantation is the definitive treatment.

■ Treat SBP with a third-generation cephalosporin (first-line therapy) or a fluoroquinolone. SBP often recurs.

Acetaminophen Toxicity

Early acetaminophen toxicity (< 24 hours) may be asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, nausea, vomiting. This may be followed by RUQ pain and transaminitis, and eventual jaundice, encephalop- athy, and multiorgan failure, possibly resulting in death.

Hematology Definitions

■ Ferritin: A measure of iron stores (↓ in iron-deficiency anemia but ↑ in infection and inflammation).

■ Haptoglobin: A protein that binds free hemoglobin (in intravascular hemolysis, free hemoglobin is released, haptoglobin binds to the hemoglo- bin, and levels of haptoglobin ↓).

■ Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): Also known as mean cell volume; a measure of the average volume of the RBCs.

■ Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): Measure of hemoglobin in a given volume of RBCs.

■ Red blood cell distribution width (RDW): Measure of the variation in volume of the RBCs (“width” refers to the volume curve or distribution width, not the actual width of the individual cells).

■ Reticulocyte count (RC): Percentage of reticulocytes (or immature blood cells) in the blood.

■ Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC): Measures the capacity of transferrin to bind with iron (or how much iron is carried throughout the body).

■ Transferrin: Protein that reversibly binds and carries iron. ■ Direct Coombs test: An antiglobulin test to determine if antibodies are

bound to the RBC membrane; indicative of hemolytic anemia.

■ Indirect Coombs test: A serum test to determine if there are antibodies to Rh factor in a mother’s blood.

Anemia

Defined as a reduction in the amount of circulating red blood cells. Confirmed through testing hematocrit and hemoglobin, which will be low (hemoglobin in anemia will be < 13.5 g/dL in men; < 12.5 g/dL in women). Once anemia is established, look next to the MCV to determine the cause (see Table 8-1).

■ Microcytic anemia = < normal MCV. ■ Normocytic anemia = normal MCV, 80–100 fL. ■ Macrocytic anemia = > normal MCV.

■ Extreme deficiencies of serum iron. ■ Chronic kidney disease.

■ Do not give IV iron to patients with active infections (risk of adverse reactions).

■ Refer to GI if GI etiology suspected.

Thalassemia Describes a group of inherited disorders that present as ↓ hemoglobin because of an error in the production of either the α- or β-globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Most α-thalassemias are found in Asians and African-Americans; β-thalassemias are found in people of Mediterranean ori- gin, Asians, and African-Americans.

History/PE Presentation is dependent on the type of thalassemia:

■ 𝛂-Thalassemia: Four alleles are responsible for the α-globin chain of

hemoglobin. ■ Single allele mutated: Patients (silent carriers) will be asymptomatic

but may pass the trait to their offspring.

■ Two alleles mutated (𝛂-thalassemia trait): This is nearly always asymptomatic but will be mildly anemic and severely microcytic.

■ Three alleles mutated (𝛂-thalassemia intermedia or hemoglobin H disease): Patients will have chronic hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly. ■ Four alleles mutated (hemoglobin Barts disease): Incompatible with

life; it is characterized by hydrops fetalis.

■ 𝛃-thalassemia: Two alleles create the β-globin chain of hemoglobin.

■ One mutated allele (𝛃-thalassemia minor or 𝛃-thalassemia trait) is asymptomatic.

■ 𝛃-thalassemia intermedia presents when there is poor production of both β-globin alleles; hemoglobin deficiency is more severe (7–10 g/dL). ■ 𝛃-thalassemia major is the most severe form (no β-globin chain pro- duction; presents with growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, jaun- dice, and bony deformities in the first year of life as production of fetal hemoglobin declines).

Diagnosis ■ Peripheral blood smear will show poikilocytosis and nucleated RBCs. ■

In α-thalassemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis shows ↑ hemoglobin A2 and possibly hemoglobin F.

■ β-Thalassemia is diagnosed with β-globin gene analysis.

trEatmEnt ■ Differs based on type of thalassemia. ■ Mild forms (eg, α-thalassemia, β-thalassemia minor) may need no treatment. ■ Moderate to severe forms (eg, α-thalassemia intermedia [hemoglobin H disease], β-thalassemia intermedia) require transfusions as needed to keep hemoglobin > 9 g/dL.

■ Severe forms (eg, β-thalassemia major) will require repeated transfusions and iron chelation therapy, or even stem cell transplant.

■ Consider splenectomy if the patient requires more than 2 units/month.

Sideroblastic Anemia Inherited or acquired disorder caused by abnormal iron metabolism. Acquired via 1° sideroblastic anemia, drug use—specifically ethanol, chloramphenicol, cycloserine, or pyrazinamide—or metal toxicity (lead, zinc, or copper).

Diagnosis Bone marrow aspirate will show ringed sideroblasts.

trEatmEnt ■ Acquired types: Remove the causative agent. ■ Inherited types: Trial of pyridoxine daily.
======================================
Anemia of Chronic Disease Caused by multiple factors: poor iron mobilization, erythropoiesis suppression as a response to an inflammatory process, or an impaired response of erythropoietin to anemia. It is also attributable to ↑ hepcidin levels in chronic inflammation.

KEY FACT

Repeated transfusions can lead to iron overload, which can result in: ■ Heart failure (HF). ■ Hepatic dysfunction. ■ Glucose intolerance. ■ Secondary hypogonadism. Chelation therapy delays or prevents these outcomes.

KEY FACT

Always consider colon cancer in an adult patient with microcytic anemia.

5B

KEY FACT

Hepcidin is important in regulating iron absorption. When iron is low, hepcidin is normally also low to stimulate iron absorption. Since chronic inflammation raises hepcidin levels, it creates an iron deficiency because of ↓ absorption.

HEMATOLOGY

Diagnosis ■ Microcytic or normocytic and low RC. ■

Iron studies: Low iron; low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC); transferrin normal (versus ↑ in iron-deficiency anemia). If ferritin is low (below 30 ng/mL), both anemia of chronic disease and iron-deficiency anemia.

trEatmEnt ■ Focus on treating the underlying disease. ■ Remove other factors such as nutritional deficiencies or marrow-suppressing

drugs.

■ Anemia with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 80–100 fL, or normo- cytic normochromic anemia, may be due to blood loss (hemorrhage), hemolysis, or ↓ production.

■ Hemolytic anemia is a state of hemolysis in which ↑ erythrocyte produc- tion is insufficient to keep up with accelerated RBC destruction. RBC destruction may be extravascular or intravascular. Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment will differ depending upon the type of anemia. Specific hemolytic anemias are outlined below (see also Table 8-3).

History/PE Look for evidence of acute bleeding. Patients with hemolytic anemia may present with jaundice and dark urine from unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia as well as with pigment gallstones and splenomegaly.

Diagnosis The initial workup includes RC, creatinine, hemolysis labs, and blood smear.

■ Normal RC: Anemia of chronic disease or chronic kidney disease. ■ ↑ RC with normal hemolysis labs: Hemorrhage. ■ ↑ RC, ↑ LDH, ↑ unconjugated bilirubin, and ↓ haptoglobin: Hemolysis.

trEatmEnt ■ Patients who are hemorrhaging must be resuscitated with RBC transfu-

sions. Identify and treat the cause.

■ Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Treatment includes steroids, immuno- suppressive agents, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and, if necessary, splenectomy.

■ Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS): Usually treated with supportive care only. Prolonged atypical HUS with acute kidney injury (AKI) will require dialysis.

■ Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): Treat with rapid plasma exchange. If unavailable, an infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is indi- cated, along with glucocorticoids. ■ Platelet transfusion is contraindicated without severe bleeding. ■ 90% remission rate, although relapses can occur years later.

Sickle Cell Anemia An autosomal recessive disease resulting from the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position in the globin chain.

KEY FACT

Hydroxyurea, a chemotherapeutic agent that reduces sickle hemoglobin and raises fetal hemoglobin, should be considered in patients symptomatic with sickle cell—particularly those with frequent pain crises and a history of strokes or other serious complications.

USMLE_FA_Step3_5e_ch08_129-146.indd 136

USMLE_FA_Step3_5e_ch08_129-146.indd 136

HEMATOLOGY

History/PE Seen predominantly among African-Americans, who often have a family his- tory. Clinical features include:

■ Chronic hemolysis resulting in gallstones, poorly healing ulcers, jaundice, splenomegaly (usually during childhood), and HF.

■ Pain due to vaso-occlusion (most commonly musculoskeletal).

Diagnosis Blood smear shows sickled cells, Howell-Jolly bodies, and evidence of hemo- lysis (See Figure 8-2). Hemoglobin electrophoresis is the definitive diagnostic test.

trEatmEnt ■ Autosplenectomy is common so vaccinate all patients against encapsulated organisms (S pneumoniae, H influenzae, N meningitidis) as well as hepati- tis B virus and the influenza virus.

■ Consider IV fluids if the patient appears dehydrated, as dehydration may worsen sickling.

■ Supplement folic acid to aid erythropoiesis. ■

Instruct patients to avoid dehydration, hypoxia, intense exercise, and high altitudes. In patients with frequent pain crises, consider hydroxyurea or bone mar- row transplantation.

■

ComPliCations ■ Pain (vaso-occlusive) crisis:

■ Sickled cells cause occlusion of arterioles, leading to tissue ischemia and/or infarction.

■ Characterized by pain in the back, limbs, abdomen, and ribs; it is pre- cipitated by dehydration, acidosis, infection, fever, or hypoxia.

■ Treat with hydration, analgesia, and supplemental oxygen.

■ Aplastic crisis: A sudden decrease in hemoglobin and RC caused by par- vovirus B19. Support with transfusions.

■ Acute chest syndrome:

■ A combination of factors, including infection, infarction, and pulmo- nary fat embolism.

■ Clinical findings include fever, chest pain, cough, wheezing, tachy- pnea, and new pulmonary infiltrate on CXR.

■ Treat with oxygen, analgesia, transfusions, and antibiotics (a second- or third-generation cephalosporin with a macrolide such as erythromycin). ■ Lungs: Pulmonary infarcts can lead to pulmonary hypertension. This is caused by chronic intravascular hemolysis, which decreases nitric oxide and leads to pulmonary artery vasoconstriction. ■ Heart: Sickle cell cardiomyopathy may lead to HF. ■ Abdomen: Cholecystitis, which may lead to cholecystectomy; splenic

infarcts.

■ Kidneys: Sickling of cells can cause infarcts, leading to papillary necrosis

and AKI, particularly in sickle cell trait. ■ Genital: Priapism and impotence in men. ■ Infections: The absence of a functional spleen predisposes patients to encapsulated organisms, including S pneumoniae, H influenzae, N menin- gitidis, and gram ⊝ bacterial infections.

■ Bones: Avascular necrosis; Salmonella osteomyelitis. ■ CNS: Stroke is one of the most devastating complications. Treat with

exchange transfusion rather than thrombolytics.

■ Pregnancy: Patients are at ↑ risk for spontaneous abortions.

Hereditary Spherocytosis Caused by a defect in the cytoskeleton of RBCs—most commonly ankyrin or spectrin. With defects in cytoskeletons, the cell membranes form blebs, which eventually break off, reducing the volume of the RBC. Cells become spherical instead of their usual disc shape.

Diagnosis ■ Spherocytes on blood smear; cells with central pallor. ■ ↑ RDW; ↑ MCHC. ■ Splenomegaly. ■ ■ Possible aplastic crisis if patients have coexisting infection of Parvovirus B19. ■ Confirmed by osmotic fragility test.
======================================
trEatmEnt Splenectomy will resolve anemia, but spherocytes will persist and develop How- ell-Jolly bodies. Remember to vaccinate against encapsulated organisms (Neisse- ria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b).

Methemoglobinemia Occurs when hemoglobin is “stuck” in an oxidized state, which is unable to carry oxygen. May be hereditary or caused by substance exposure (benzo- caine, dapsone, sulfonamides).

History/PE Shortness of breath with no clear etiology. CXR is normal. May also present with dizziness, confusion, headaches, and seizures.

Diagnosis ■ Pulse oximetry classically reads 85% due to the color given off by oxidized hemoglobin particles. Diagnose methemoglobinemia with co-oximetry.

M A C R O C Y T I C A N E M I A

Anemia with an MCV of > 100 fL. Characterized by impaired DNA synthe- sis with normal cytoplasm maturation and delayed nucleus development that results in macrocytosis. The most common etiologies include:

■ Folate deficiency: Poor dietary intake (including alcoholism) and drugs (eg, phenytoin, zidovudine, TMP-SMX, methotrexate and other chemo- therapeutic agents).

■ B12 deficiency: Commonly caused by a strict vegan diet, pernicious ane- mia (destruction of gastric parietal cells leading to a lack of intrinsic factor and therefore ↓ absorption), gastrectomy, proton pump inhibitors (which inhibit B12 absorption), and ileal dysfunction (IBD, surgical resection). B12 deficiency can cause neurologic deficits (paresthesias, gait disturbance, and mental status changes).

■ Other: Liver disease, hypothyroidism, alcohol abuse, myelodysplasia, and fish tapeworm.

Diagnosis ■ Check serum B12, folate and obtain a blood smear to look for megaloblastic anemia, which shows oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils. If B12 deficiency is suspected, check intrinsic factor antibody and anti– parietal cell antibody for pernicious anemia.

■ Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels can distinguish folate

from B12 deficiency: ■ Folate deficient: ↑ Homocysteine but normal MMA. ■ B12 deficient: ↑ Homocysteine and ↑ MMA.

trEatmEnt ■ Treat B12 deficiency with monthly B12 shots or oral replacement (in a normal GI tract, oral replacement has been shown to be as effective as IV); treat folate deficiency with oral replacement.

■ Discontinue any medications that could be contributing to megaloblastic anemia; minimize alcohol use.

HEMATOLOGY

■ Dx: Bone marrow is difficult to aspirate (“dry tap”). Labs ↑ LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid.

■ Tx: Asymptomatic patients should be followed. If symptomatic, treat sup- portively with transfusions, hydroxyurea, and occasionally splenectomy or radiation. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be considered in younger patients.

Bleeding Disorders

Disorders in coagulation or platelets that predispose patients to bleed (see Table 8-5).

Diagnosis ■ Think thrombocytopenia when the platelet count is < 90,000/μL. ■ Think coagulopathy if the prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplas- tin time (PTT) is ↑ (see Figure 8-4 and the discussion of coagulopathies).

trEatmEnt ■ Patients who are hemodynamically unstable need immediate resuscitation

with IV fluids. The source of hemorrhage should be treated.

■ Blood transfusions should be given to maintain a hemoglobin level of > 7 g/dL. FFP should be given to normalize PTT and PT. Platelets should be given as needed.

P L AT E L E T D I S O R D E R S

A decrease in the number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) as well as a decrease in the functioning of platelets predisposes patients to bleed (platelet dysfunction). Look for petechiae and easy bruising. In addition to TTP and HUS, common platelet disorders include:

■ ↑ Platelet destruction:

■ Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)/autoimmune thrombo- cytopenia: Severe thrombocytopenia due to platelet-associated IgG antibodies; this is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment involves predni- sone and, if the patient is unresponsive to steroids, splenectomy.

■ Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Immune-mediated thrombocyto- penia occurring 5–14 days after the initiation of heparin (or < 24 hours

Stop heparin immediately and start an alternative anticoagulant such as fondaparinux, lepirudin, arg- atroban, or danaparoid sodium (not warfarin). Do not use a low molecu- lar weight heparin.

■ Platelet dysfunction—acquired:

■ Acquired disease: Platelet function can be impaired as a result of severe liver disease (from splenic sequestration), severe renal disease, or multi- ple myeloma. Treat with desmopressin, FFP, or cryoprecipitate for major bleeding. Do not use aspirin or NSAIDs as they inhibit platelet function.

5
======================================
KEY FACT

Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: Treat with Prednisone.

■ Drug-induced thrombocytopenia: One of the most common causes of mild asymptomatic thrombocytopenia. Common medications include quinine, antibiotics, sulfa drugs, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. It usually resolves within 1 week of stopping the implicated drug.

■ Platelet dysfunction—inherited: Includes Bernard-Soulier syndrome (a problem with adhesion), Glanzmann thrombasthenia (a problem with aggregation), and storage pool disease (problems with platelet granule release). Treatment is the same as that for acquired disease.

Diagnosis ■ Confirm the presence of thrombocytopenia (ie, recheck platelets in

citrated blood).

■ Check a peripheral blood smear and a 1-hour post-transfusion platelet count to distinguish ↓ platelet production (pancytopenia, small platelets, ↑ platelet count following platelet transfusion) from ↑ platelet destruction (large plate- lets, no significant rise in platelet count after platelet transfusion).

======================================
C O A G U LO PAT H I E S

A defective clotting cascade predisposes patients to bleeding. Ask about medi- cations that predispose to bleeding (eg, warfarin, enoxaparin, heparin); note factors that predispose to vitamin K deficiency (eg, liver disease, malnutrition, antibiotic use, alcoholism).

■ Recurrent spontaneous bleeding suggests a factor deficiency (eg, factor VIII [hemophilia A] or factor IX [hemophilia B]).

■ Delayed bleeding after trauma or surgery (classically after the umbilical cord falls off) suggests factor XIII deficiency.

Diagnosis ■ Look for evidence of liver disease on exam and order liver function tests

and PT/PTT.

■ Defects in the clotting cascade can be due to defects in the intrinsic path-

way, the extrinsic pathway, or the common pathway. ■ Intrinsic pathway: Involves factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. Abnormality results in a rise in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Impaired in patients with hemophilia A (factor VIII) or B (factor IX). ■ Extrinsic pathway: Involves factor VII. Abnormality leads to a rise in

PT (INR). Prolonged by warfarin.

■ Common pathway: Involves factors V, X, and II (prothrombin). An increase is seen in both aPTT and PT (INR).

trEatmEnt ■ Coagulopathic patients who are actively bleeding need FFP to normalize their PT and PTT levels. All pharmacologic anticoagulation should be stopped. If vitamin K deficiency is suspected, it is reasonable to give oral vitamin K empirically for 3 days to see if PT normalizes.

■ Patients with hemophilia A or B require factor VIII (either recombinant factor VIII or as cryoprecipitate) or factor IX replacement, respectively.

von Willebrand Disease An autosomal dominant condition that is the most common bleeding disor- der. Characterized by low levels of vWF, which is involved in the transport of factor VIII and also helps platelets form a hemostatic plug.

History/PE Clinical features can mimic platelet dysfunction (causing mucocutaneous bleeds and ↑ bleeding time) as well as hemophilia (joint bleeds, ↑ aPTT) depending on the subtype.

Diagnosis Diagnosed by ↓ levels of:

■ vWF (also called factor VIII antigen). ■ Ristocetin cofactor level. ■ Factor VIII (functional) level.

■ Desmopressin (increases endothelial release of vWF) is first-line therapy in symptomatic cases.
======================================
Hypercoagulable State (Thrombophilia)

Thrombophilias are a group of conditions that predispose patients to blood clotting. They may be inherited or acquired (see Table 8-6).

History/PE Look for possible 1° causes of hypercoagulability in the following patients:

■ Those with a history of a first venous thrombotic event before age 50. ■ Those with recurrent thrombotic episodes. ■ Those who have had a thrombotic event as well as a first-degree relative

who experienced a thromboembolic event before age 50.
======================================
aAcquired thrombophilia is associated with prolonged rest, immobilization, smoking, oral contraceptive pill use, pregnancy, nephrotic syndrome, cancer, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and lupus anticoagulant (antiphospholipid syndrome).

HEMATOLOGY

Diagnosis ■ Screening should include APC resistance, prothrombin gene mutation, antiphospholipid antibody, plasma homocysteine, antithrombin defi- ciency, protein C deficiency, and protein S deficiency.

■ Protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III are affected by acute thrombo- sis or anticoagulation. Check levels for at least 2–4 weeks after completing anticoagulation.

trEatmEnt ■ Acute thrombosis must be treated with at least 6 months of anticoagulation. ■

Indications for lifelong anticoagulation include: ■ > 2 spontaneous thromboses. ■ Antithrombin deficiency. ■ Antiphospholipid syndrome. ■ Spontaneous life-threatening thrombosis. ■ Thrombosis in an unusual site (eg, the mesenteric or cerebral vein). ■ Warfarin takes 3–5 days to reach its therapeutic effect, can lead to serious skin necrosis in those with protein C deficiency, and can initially be thrombotic. Thus, bridge with heparin.

■ Pregnant women with a history of hypercoagulable state need to be treated with low molecular weight heparin due to warfarin’s teratogenic effects.

KEY FACT

■ T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells are derived from a common lymphoid progenitor.

■ Megakaryocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, erythrocytes, and mast cells are derived from a common myeloid progenitor.

L E U K E M I A

Defined as malignant proliferations of hematopoietic cells. May be myeloge- nous or lymphocytic and may have an acute or chronic course, but all gener- ally result in marrow failure that produces anemia, infections, and bleeding by reducing red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, respectively (see Table 9-1). Characterized as follows:

■ Acute leukemia: Immature cells (myeloblasts, lymphoblasts); at least 20% blasts in bone marrow (cases with < 20% blasts are defined as “myelodys- plastic syndrome”). Typically affects the very young or very old with a short and potentially life-threatening course.

;

KEY FACT

■ Chronic leukemia: More mature differentiated cells (metamyelocytes/ myelocytes and lymphocytes). Affects middle-aged adults and has a more protracted and insidious course.

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is associated with aggressive lymphomas (eg, Burkitt) in patients with immune deficiencies such as HIV.

LY M P H O M A

KEY FACT

Stem cell transplantation is used for a variety of hematologic malignancies and has two types: ■ Autologous: The patient serves as the source of stem cells (eg, multiple myeloma, lymphoma). ■ Allogeneic: Stem cells are acquired

from a matched donor (eg, leukemia, aplastic anemia, MDS).

and 1% from monocytes or natural killer (NK) cells. There are two main types: Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see Table 9-2).

Hodgkin Lymphoma A malignancy that is thought to arise from B cells and is associated with neo- plastic Reed-Sternberg cells (see Figure 9-3). EBV infection may play a role in its pathogenesis.

History/PE ■ Usually presents with cervical or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and spreads in a contiguous manner along the lymph nodes. Enlarged lymph nodes that fail to resolve after 3–4 weeks should be investigated with biopsy. The spleen is the most commonly involved intra-abdominal site. ■ B symptoms, which indicate bulky disease and a worse prognosis, are

B symptoms, which indicate bulky disease and a worse prognosis, are defined as:

defined as: ■ 10% weight loss in 6 months. ■ Night sweats requiring a change of clothes/sheets. ■ Fever: Temperature > 38.5°C (101.3°F).

Diagnosis ■ Excisional lymph node biopsy shows Reed-Sternberg cells. ■ Staging is based on anatomic lymph node involvement; prognosis depends on stage and other risk factors. PET/CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is gold standard for staging; bone marrow biopsies should also be considered.

trEatmEnt Chemotherapy with doxorubicin (Adriamycin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine (ABVD cocktail) +/− radiation of the involved field.

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma A proliferation of B and occasionally T cells. Classified as indolent or aggres- sive by histologic type (see Table 9-3). Extranodal involvement is common. Associated with infections—EBV with Burkitt lymphoma; HIV with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma; human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) with T-cell lymphoma; and H pylori with gastric MALToma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type.

History/PE Symptoms similar to other lymphomas. Lymphadenopathy typically occurs in groups of peripheral nodes, and patients may have fewer B symptoms.

■ Treatment of high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be complicated by tumor lysis syndrome (see below). Treat with aggressive hydration and allopurinol.

■ Gastric MALTomas are treated with antibiotics if H pylori ⊕. ■ All HIV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma requires initiation of antiretrovi-

ral therapy.

T U M O R LY S I S S Y N D R O M E

A metabolic disturbance that may follow the initiation of cancer therapy. Most often associated with high-grade lymphomas or ALL. It is an oncologic emergency!

History/PE ■ Tumor cell lysis results in severe hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia. Hyperuricemia results from the release of large amounts of serum nucleic acids, and hypocalcemia is 2° to cal- cium phosphate deposition. Can quickly lead to renal failure from uric acid crystal and calcium phosphate deposition.

■ Clinical manifestations may also include seizure, cardiac arrhythmia, or sudden death.

trEatmEnt ■ Prevent with adequate IV hydration and the reduction of uric acid with allopurinol or rasburicase (the drug of choice if uric acid levels are high before the initiation of chemotherapy).

■ Correct electrolyte abnormalities using phosphate binders, calcium gluco- nate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate.

■ Consider dialysis if abnormalities are severe or do not respond to therapies.

KEY FACT

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in which lymphocytes from the donor mount an immune response to the patient’s organs; manifesting most commonly as skin, GI, and/ or liver involvement. Prophylactic immunosuppressive agents reduce the risk of GVHD.

A malignancy of monoclonal plasma cells within bone marrow, often with unbalanced, excessive production of immunoglobulin protein. Typically seen in older adults.

History/PE ■ Often presents with one or more of the four primary manifestations of the disease known by the mnemonic CRAB. These can be discovered on rou- tine labs or by the symptoms they can cause. HyperCalcemia (“stones, bones, abdominal groans, and psychiatric overtones”), Renal failure, Ane- mia (fatigue), and/or Bone lesions (bone pain or pathologic fractures). See Table 9-4.

■ May also present with frequent infections 2° to dysregulation of antibody production.

DiffErEntial Contains several plasma cell dyscrasias and includes the spectrum myeloma- associated diseases: Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (see Table 9-5), along with the related dis- orders of AL amyloidosis (see below) and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, characterized by ↑ cold agglutinins (can cause autoimmune hemolysis, lymph- adenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly).

Diagnosis ■ Can be diagnosed in several different ways, all relating to the primary dis- order of plasma cells and importantly distinguishing it from MGUS and smoldering myeloma, as well as Waldenström macroglobulinemia. This includes any of the following scenarios: ■ Bone marrow biopsy showing > 10% clonal plasma cells or extramed-

ullary plasmacytoma + end organ damage (CRAB).

■ Bone marrow biopsy with > 60% clonal plasma cells, regardless of presence of end organ damage.

■ Serum free light chain ratio of > 100:1 of involved to uninvolved light chains.

■ A full-body skeletal survey is the test of choice to demonstrate “punched- out” osteolytic lesions of the skull and long bones (see Figure 9-4).

It is important to determine which patients are candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. The latter improves disease- free and overall survival.

There are many types of amyloidosis, but all are characterized by tissue depo- sition of abnormal protein fibrils. AL amyloidosis, one of the most common types, is a disorder of plasma cells that leads to deposition of monoclonal light chains in organs such as the kidney and heart, resulting in proteinuria and restrictive cardiomyopathy (see Table 9-6).

Breast Cancer

A malignant neoplasm of ductal or lobular breast tissue. The most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second most common cause of cancer death in women in the United States (after lung cancer).

■ Screening: All organizations recommend screening with mammography at least every 2 years between the ages of 50 and 74, but starting screening earlier may be considered in certain patients (see the Ambulatory Medi- cine chapter).

■ Risk factors: Include female gender, older age, obesity, early menarche, late menopause, first childbirth after 30 years, hormone replacement ther- apy use for > 5 years, ↑ alcohol intake (2–5 drinks per day), breast cancer in first-degree relatives, a history of atypical hyperplasia or carcinoma in situ, BRCA1/2 mutation. Certain risk factors may influence the decision of when to start screening and with what imaging modality.

History/PE ■ Often diagnosed in asymptomatic patients on screening imaging. When presenting symptomatically, most masses are hard, irregular, immobile, and painless, possibly with nipple discharge.

9/28/18 2:02 PM

ONCOLOGY

■ Adolescents may experience breast tenderness that resolves with menses. Solitary masses in adolescent women are often fibroadenomas that fluctu- ate in size with menses; they may resolve completely.

■ Skin changes (dimpling, erythema, ulceration) and axillary adenopathy indicate more advanced disease.

Diagnosis ■ When a mass is detected on exam, the first imaging study of choice is a diagnostic mammogram, which may demonstrate microcalcifications, hyperdense regions, and irregular borders.

■ Ultrasound is an appropriate initial imaging modality in women < 40 years of age or for confirming suspicious lesions seen on mammography in women > 40 years (ie, to check for cystic vs solid lesions). All abnormal findings on mammogram or ultrasound should be confirmed with a biopsy. ■ Obtain biopsies, then determine estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR)

and HER2/neu status to help guide treatment strategy.

■ Special forms of breast cancer include:

■ Inflammatory breast cancer: Highly aggressive and rapidly growing; invades the lymphatics and causes skin inflammation (peau d’orange). Has a poor prognosis.

■ Paget disease: Ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer of the nip- ple with unilateral itching, burning, and nipple erosion. May be mis- taken for infection or eczema; associated with another focus of invasive cancer elsewhere in the breast.

trEatmEnt ■ Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Preferred treatment modality is lumpectomy +/− radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy for a duration of 5 years reduces the risk of recurrence in ER/PR ⊕ tumors.

■ Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): Carries a high risk (up to 20%) of developing a subsequent infiltrating breast cancer, including cancer in the contralateral breast. Consider close monitoring, mastectomy, or tamoxifen for prophylaxis.

■ Invasive breast cancer: Choice of treatment is based on lymph node sta- tus, tumor size, and hormone receptor status (see Table 9-7).

■ Adjuvant chemotherapy: Indicated for larger tumors, those associated with a high risk of recurrence (based on genomic assay), hormone ⊝ tumors, and lymph node involvement. Several regimens are now used (eg, cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin followed by paclitaxel for 4–6 months).

KEY FACT

Breast-conserving surgery is generally as effective as radical mastectomy in patients with a unifocal tumor size of < 5 cm.

■ Endocrine therapy: Some types of breast cancer are dependent on estro- gen for growth. Endocrine therapy is indicated for all patients with ER/PR ⊕ tumors. ■

In premenopausal women, estrogen is produced by the ovaries. Tamoxifen and raloxifene block estrogen effects on receptors. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is produced by fat and muscles. Aromatase peripherally converts androgens to estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole do not inhibit ovarian production of estrogen and are thus ineffective in premenopausal women.

KEY FACT

ER/PR ⊕ status is a good prognostic indicator; patients should be treated with hormonal therapy.

■ Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is beneficial for those with HER2-neu ⊕

tumors. In BRCA ⊕ patients, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and/or salpingo- oophorectomy significantly ↓ the risk of breast or ovarian cancer.

Central Cavitary HyperCalcemia

A malignancy of lung tissue (subtypes are described in Table 9-8). It remains the leading cause of cancer death.

(miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis), and lower brachial plexopathy.

■ Superior vena cava syndrome: Characterized by swelling of the face and arm, most often on the right side, and ↑ jugular venous pressure (JVP); urgent treatment with radiation.

■ Hoarseness: Vocal cord paralysis from entrapment of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, most often on the left.

DiffErEntial ■ Patients with a history of exposure to asbestos are at ↑ risk of bronchogenic

carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma.

■ Any lung nodule in a smoker or an ex-smoker should be evaluated for can- cer. Serial CXRs are useful for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Lesions that remain stable > 2 years are generally not cancerous. ■ Other features suggestive of benign lesions include young age, smooth margins, and small size (< 2 cm). Eccentric or heterogeneous calcifica- tion and spiculated margins are more typical of malignant lesions, while popcorn or central calcifications are typically more benign.

Diagnosis ■ Biopsy of the lung mass is critical. If there is a palpable lymph node, con- sider biopsy of the node first. Order a CXR, and in doubtful or suspicious cases, obtain a chest CT and, if necessary, bronchoscopy. If mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged, consider a PET scan and medias- tinoscopy for proper staging.

■ Centrally located cancers can be diagnosed by bronchoscopy or sputum cytology.

■ Staging workup includes chest and abdominal CT with contrast or PET scan, bone scan, and MRI of the brain.

Paraneoplastic Syndromes

Disorders or symptoms that result from an immune, hormonal, or cytokine response to a neoplasm. Can present before the diagnosis of cancer.

■ Hypercalcemia: Most often seen with squamous cell carcinoma from ↑ PTHrP production or bone metastases. Treat with bisphosphonates. ■ SIADH/hyponatremia: Occurs more frequently with small cell carci-

noma, secondary to increased ADH production.

■ Cushing disease: Results from overproduction of ACTH secreted by small cell carcinoma. ACTH ↑ cortisol levels; can also cause high BP or new- onset DM.

■ Lambert-Eaton syndrome: Like myasthenia gravis except that muscle fatigue improves with repeated stimulation (vs myasthenia gravis, in which repeated stimulation yields no improvement). Found more often in small cell carcinoma.

■ Erythrocytosis: Seen in renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carci- noma 2° to ectopic erythropoietin production.

GI Tumors

PA N C R E AT I C C A N C E R

Typically seen in patients > 50 years of age. The most common histology is ductal adenocarcinoma, accounting for 85% of primary tumors; > 60–70% of tumors arise in the head of the pancreas. Risk factors include smoking, chronic pancreatitis, and DM, although patients often have no risk factors. Trousseau syndrome (migratory thrombophlebitis; hypercoagulable state with venous thrombosis associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma) can occur.

History/PE Most commonly presenting as painless jaundice (due to obstruction from can- cer in the head of the pancreas), pancreatic cancer can be accompanied by a number of symptoms, including nausea, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal and lumbar back pain, new-onset DM, and venous thromboembolism.

Diagnosis ■ Laboratory abnormalities may include ↑ bilirubin, ↑ aminotransferases,

and normocytic normochromic anemia.

■ Ultrasound is useful as an initial diagnostic test. Abdominal/pelvic CT can show the extent of disease (see Figure 9-7) and help determine whether the mass is resectable.

■ Endoscopic U/S yields excellent anatomic detail and can help determine whether the tumor is resectable.

trEatmEnt ■ Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) is appropriate for patients

with resectable tumors.

■ Chemotherapy or radiation is used for palliative care in patients with advanced or unresectable disease.

Typically occurs after the age of 50 years, although the incidence is currently rising among those under 50 for unknown reasons. The fourth most common cause of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, after lung cancer. Table 9-9 highlights the various risk factors. Screen- ing for colorectal cancer typically begins at age 50 but may begin earlier in patients with affected first-degree relatives, African-American patients, and in those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or certain genetic syndromes (see the Ambulatory Medicine chapter).

History/PE Symptoms depend on the site of the 1° tumor and may include a change in bowel habits, melena, bright red blood per rectum, weight loss, fatigue, vomit- ing, or abdominal discomfort.

■ Stage I patients have an excellent prognosis with surgery alone (90% sur- vival at 5 years).

■ Adjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU based) is warranted for patients at stage III and above.

M I S C E L L A N E O U S G I T U M O R S

Esophageal Tumors ■ Risk factors include:

■ Lower esophagus: Obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and Barrett esophagus (associated with adenocarcinoma).

■ Upper esophagus: Tobacco and alcohol use (associated with squamous cell carcinoma).

■ Hx/PE: Dysphagia in elderly person. Esophageal reflux with Barrett esophagus.

■ Dx: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy (see Figure 9-10). ■ Tx: Resection for localized disease; radiation with chemotherapy for

advanced disease.

Gastric Tumors ■ Risk factors include H pylori, smoking, and a ⊕ family history. More com-

mon in Asia and South America.

■ Hx/PE: Classically presents as iron-deficiency anemia with vague abdomi- nal pain in elderly patients.

■ Dx: EGD with biopsy (see Figure 9-11). ■ Tx: Resection for localized disease and radiation therapy with chemother-

apy for advanced disease.

Carcinoid Tumors (Neuroendocrine Tumors) ■ Usually occur in the appendix or small bowel. ■ Hx/PE: Clinical features include flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and tricuspid regurgitation (carcinoid syndrome; symptoms result from ↑ sero- tonin). Tumors may also be asymptomatic and may be discovered incidentally.

■ Dx: Diagnosed by elevated levels of 5-HIAA (the breakdown product of serotonin) or chromogranin A.

■ Tx: Surgical resection is curative in localized disease. For symptomatic control, consider octreotide, a synthetic somatostatin analog that ↓ the secretion of serotonin. Patients with well-differentiated tumors can be managed with close observation and serial imaging.

Islet Cell Tumors ■ Hx/PE: Presentation depends on type. Insulinoma presents with the triad of hypoglycemic symptoms, a fasting blood glucose < 40 mg/dL, and immediate relief with glucose. VIPoma (↑ VIP levels): Suspect in profuse, watery diarrhea that causes hypokalemia. Glucagonoma: Persistent hyper- glycemia with necrolytic erythema (intertriginous and perioral rash).

■ Dx: Islet cell tumors and their metastases (liver is most common) can be localized by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.

■ Tx: Options vary according to type. Treatment includes surgical resection, debulking, chemotherapy, and somatostatin analogs with glucagonomas and VIPomas.

Genitourinary Tumors

B L A D D E R C A N C E R

The most common malignant tumor of the urinary tract; usually transitional cell carcinoma (now known as Urothelial carcinoma). Risk factors include smoking, exposure to aniline (rubber) dyes, and chronic bladder infections (eg, schistosomiasis).

History/PE Gross painless hematuria is the most common symptom. Other symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and dysuria, may also be seen.

Diagnosis ■ UA often shows hematuria (macro- or microscopic). Lack of dysmorphic RBCs helps distinguish this from glomerular bleeding. Cytology may show dysplastic cells.

■ CT urography or IV pyelography can examine the upper urinary tract as

well as defects in bladder filling. ■ Cystoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic.

trEatmEnt Depends on the extent of spread beyond the bladder mucosa.

■ Noninvasive stage I: Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). If high risk (histologic grade or invasion), treat with intravesical immunotherapy (eg, bacillus Calmette-Guérin). If very low risk, observe or give a single dose of intravesicular chemotherapy.

■ Invasive cancers without metastases: Aggressive surgery, radiation ther- apy, or both.

■ Distant metastases: Chemotherapy alone.
======================================
P R O S TAT E C A N C E R

The most common cancer in men; 95% are adenocarcinomas. Risk ↑ linearly with age.

History/PE ■ Many patients are asymptomatic and are incidentally diagnosed either by DRE or by a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level that is obtained for screening purposes. If symptomatic, patients may present with urinary urgency/frequency/ hesitancy and, in late or aggressive disease, with anemia, hematuria, or low back pain (from bone metastases).

■ Routine screening in asymptomatic patients with PSA is controversial. Most groups now recommend a shared decision-making process (typically beginning at age 55), in which physician and patient together choose the best screening option. Factors to consider are: ■ Risks: Side effects of additional work-up with prostate biopsy (can lead to incontinence, impotence); anxiety involved with an elevated PSA. Indolent course of some prostate cancers and ability to pursue “watch- ful waiting” as opposed to treatment.

■ Benefits: ↓ in mortality among screened population. ■ However, if the patient is symptomatic, test, as you are no longer

“screening.”

Diagnosis ■ Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate allows for both diagnosis

and staging.

■ The Gleason score (6–10) remains the best predictor of clinical behavior. It sums the scores of the two most prevalent differentiation patterns seen on biopsy on a scale of 1–5: well differentiated (low) to poorly differenti- ated (high).

■ Radionuclide bone scan (technetium-99) is the best modality to diagnose bone metastasis in prostate cancer.

trEatmEnt ■ Choice is based on the aggressiveness of the tumor and on the patient’s

risk of dying from the disease.

■ Watchful waiting may be the best approach for elderly patients with low Gleason scores.

■ Consider radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy (eg, brachytherapy or external beam) for node ⊝ disease. Treatment is associated with an ↑ risk of incontinence and/or impotence. Androgen deprivation therapy is often indicated following radiation therapy even in node (–) disease for high-risk disease.

■ Treat node ⊕ and metastatic disease with androgen deprivation therapy (eg, GnRH agonists, orchiectomy, bicalutamide) +/− chemotherapy. Symptomatic bone lesions can be treated with palliative radiation.
======================================
T E S T I C U L A R C A N C E R

Most common solid malignant tumor in men 20–35 years of age. It is highly treatable and often curable; 95% are germ cell tumors (seminomas or non- seminomas); pure seminomas have a better prognosis. Risk factors: family his- tory, cryptorchid testis, and Klinefelter syndrome.

History/PE ■ A unilateral painless scrotal mass is testicular cancer until proven

otherwise.

■ Other symptoms include testicular discomfort or swelling suggestive of orchitis or epididymitis.

Diagnosis ■ Serum levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP), LDH, and β-hCG should be

measured.

■ Scrotal ultrasound is useful to differentiate non-neoplastic lesions (eg, hydrocele, spermatocele, infection) (see Figure 9-12).

■ Definitive diagnosis is made by radical inguinal orchiectomy. ■ Staging evaluation (TNM is widely used) should include serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), AFP, β-hCG, and CT of the chest/abdomen and pelvis (the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and thorax are usually the first sites of metastasis).

Malignancies of the kidneys are often diagnosed incidentally but may be asso- ciated with various symptoms as noted below. Typically a disease of older age and is more common in men. Like many other malignancies, cigarette smok- ing is a risk factor, although it is also associated with several conditions, including von Hippel Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and cystic kidney disease. Clear cell is the most common type.

History/PE ■ Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is generally asymptomatic in the early stages, but symptoms can include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, fevers, night sweats, anemia, or symptoms of disseminated disease such as dyspnea and bone pain.

■ Paraneoplastic effects such as erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, and hyperten- sion may be seen.

Diagnosis ■ Most cases are found incidentally (see Figure 9-13). ■ Renal ultrasound can determine whether the mass is cystic or solid. CT- guided biopsies are usually not performed if the mass fits the appropriate radiographic criteria for RCC.

trEatmEnt ■ Local disease: Partial vs radical nephrectomy vs cryoablation/radiofre-

quency ablation.

■ Disseminated disease: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (pazopanib, sunitinib), immunotherapy (nivolumab, atezoli- zumab), chemotherapy, or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibi- tors (eg, everolimus).

Malignancies of the ovary are typically seen in women > 50 years of age and are 95% epithelial in origin. They are associated with several genetic and familial conditions, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and BRCA1/2, and risk is ↑ by delayed menopause and infertility (while the use of ovulatory agents to treat infertility has not been proven to ↑ the risk of ovarian cancer). On the contrary, OCPs, childbirth, breastfeeding, bilateral tubal ligation, and total abdominal hysterectomy–bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy (TAH-BSO) are all protective.

History/PE ■ Usually asymptomatic until the disease has reached an advanced stage. ■ Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, pelvic pressure, urinary fre- quency, early satiety, constipation, vaginal bleeding, and systemic symp- toms (fatigue, malaise, weight loss).

■ Exam reveals a palpable solid, fixed, nodular pelvic mass; ascites; and pleural effusion (Meigs syndrome). Ovarian mass in postmenopausal women is ovarian cancer until proven otherwise.

History/PE ■ Usually asymptomatic and diagnosed on routine Pap smear. ■

If symptomatic, patients may present with menorrhagia and/or metrorrha- gia, postcoital bleeding, pelvic pain, and vaginal discharge.

Diagnosis ■ Colposcopy and biopsy in patients with an abnormal Pap smear or visible

cervical lesions.

■ Cervical lesions categorized as cervical carcinoma (depth > 3 mm, width > 7 mm) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

trEatmEnt ■ CIN I (mild dysplasia, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion): Can be

monitored in appropriate settings with further Pap smear testing.

■ CIN II (moderate dysplasia, classification depends on further testing) and CIN III (severe dysplasia or carcinoma in-situ, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion): Typically require excision or ablation of transforma- tion zone (T-zone).

■ Invasive cancer: Early-stage disease can be treated with surgery or radia- tion therapy; advanced disease can be treated with chemotherapy +/− sur- gical resection.

PrEvEntion HPV vaccine: The CDC recommends a two-dose vaccine schedule if started before age 15 years and a three-dose schedule if started between 15 and 26 years. The vaccine targets HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18; HPV 6 and 11 cause most genital warts, HPV 16 and 18 cause most cervical cancers.

CNS Tumors

1° brain tumors make up < 2% of all tumors diagnosed. Meningioma, gli- oma, vestibular schwannoma, pituitary adenoma, and 1° CNS lymphoma are the most common CNS tumors in adults. There is an ↑ risk in immunocom- promised states such as AIDS. Imaging findings can help distinguish the tumor from other intracranial lesions (see Table 9-10).

M E N I N G I O M A

■ Accounts for one-third of all 1° brain tumors; the tumors are usually benign. ■ Hx/PE: Most tumors are small, asymptomatic, and discovered inciden- tally. When symptoms are present, they usually consist of progressive headache or a focal neurologic deficit reflecting the location of the tumor. Symptoms can also include spastic paresis, urinary incontinence, or new- onset seizures.

■ Dx: CT or MRI of the head typically demonstrates a partially calcified, homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass adherent to the dura (see Table 9-10, image A). Craniopharyngioma can cause bitemporal hemianopia. ■ Tx: Surgical resection is appropriate for large or symptomatic tumors; observation with serial scans is the preferred approach for small or asymp- tomatic lesions.

Cancer Treatment Side Effects

All chemotherapeutic agents have side effects that are important to be aware of as they can affect pretreatment screening as well as parameters to monitor while on therapy:

■ Anthracyclines, such as Adriamycin (doxorubicin): Used for the treat- ment of lymphomas (ABVD for Hodgkin lymphoma and R-CHOP for non-Hodgkin lymphoma), breast cancer, and several other malignancies. Most concerning side effect is dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients should be prescreened with radionuclide ventriculography or echocardiography. ■ Bleomycin: Used for testicular cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ABVD) among other malignancies. Most concerning side effect is pulmo- nary fibrosis. Patients should be prescreened with pulmonary function tests.

■ Cisplatin/Carboplatin/Oxaliplatin: Used in the treatment of a variety of malignancies. Can cause renal toxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy.

■ Cyclophosphamide: Used for a variety of malignancies. Can cause hem- orrhagic cystitis.

■ Methotrexate: Used for a variety of malignancies. Can cause myelosup- pression resulting in pancytopenia. Can induce folate deficiency resulting specifically in macrocytic anemia. Folinic acid (leucovorin) is used to treat this disorder as it bypasses the mechanism by which methotrexate operates.

■ Radiation: Used for a variety of malignancies. Can cause inflammation (eg, dermatitis, colitis, cystitis, pneumonitis) at any site of treatment. In patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (especially in younger patients), radia- tion to the chest can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, or coronary disease.

■ Metoclopramide: Dopamine antagonist often used to treat nausea associ- ated with chemotherapy. Can cause extrapyramidal symptoms.

History/PE ■ Presents with warm, erythematous, and tender skin (see Figure 10-3). ■ Patients may also have fever, chills, regional lymphadenopathy, lymphan-

gitis (seen as red streaks), or associated abscess.

DiffErEntial ■ Cellulitis in the lower extremities may be difficult to distinguish from stasis dermatitis; look for clues suggesting cellulitis, including new-onset erythema, unilateral findings, and systemic symptoms.

■ Consider necrotizing fasciitis if the patient presents with pain out of proportion to the PE findings with or without evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

■ May be differentiated from hypersensitivity reactions, which usually present with discrete urticarial lesions (hives) that are pruritic and in the distribution of the suspected allergen (eg, belt buckle).

■ Lower extremity cellulitis can be associated with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). If clinically indicated, ultrasound may be useful for evaluation.

Diagnosis ■ Cellulitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis. ■ Consider obtaining blood cultures, CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and radiographs if there is a possibility of deeper infection such as necrotizing fasciitis or osteomyelitis.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: First-generation cephalosporin (such as cephalexin) or an anti- staphylococcal penicillin (such as dicloxacillin) if S aureus is suspected (usually associated with an abscess).

■ For MRSA coverage: Clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX. ■ For inpatients: Vancomycin may be used. ■ Choose an antibiotic with GNR coverage for patients with diabetes. ■ For human or animal bites, choose a penicillin/penicillinase combination (eg, amoxicillin/clavulanate) for coverage of anaerobes, Pasteurella, and Capnocytophaga; consider tetanus vaccination. If associated with abscess, perform incision and drainage.

Rapidly spreading infection of the subcutaneous fat and fascia.

History/PE ■ Presents with erythematous, warm, and tender skin that may rapidly prog- ress to dark, indurated skin with bullae. Patients typically appear more toxic than those with simple cellulitis and may have significant pain in the involved area. The presence of subcutaneous gas on examination is also a clue.

■ A complication of necrotizing fasciitis is compartment syndrome due to edema, which causes elevated intracompartmental pressure that ulti- mately leads to hypoperfusion of the muscle. Symptoms of compartment syndrome include pain seemingly out of proportion to the infection, mus- cle weakness, and paresthesia/numbness.

DiffErEntial May be difficult to distinguish from cellulitis and requires a high degree of suspicion. Pain out of proportion to the PE findings distinguishes necrotizing

KEY FACT

Compartment syndrome can present with a normal or unchanged arterial pulse.

A 43-year-old man with diabetes presents with 1 week of edema, erythema, and warmth of his anterior left lower leg. You start him on IV vancomycin for cellulitis. A few hours later, he complains of 10/10 pain in his left leg. His leg is extremely painful to manipulation, and left foot dorsiflexion is 3/5. His left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 1+, unchanged from baseline. What is the next step?

CHAPTER 10

KEY FACT

If necrotizing fasciitis is suspected, prompt medical and surgical management is imperative.

ay .\

The patient’s presentation raises concern for acute compartment syndrome, which suggests that his soft tissue infection has extended to the muscle fascia (ie, necrotizing fasciitis). Acute compartment syndrome requires immediate surgical consultation for possible fasciotomy.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE

fasciitis from cellulitis. An ↑ creatine kinase level can suggest the presence of myonecrosis or myositis in addition to necrotizing fasciitis.

Diagnosis Obtain a CT or an MRI to look for gas and soft tissue involvement.

trEatmEnt ■ Obtain a surgery consult for debridement. Fasciotomy may be needed if

compartment syndrome develops.

■ A penicillin is best for coverage of group A streptococcus; clindamycin may be used to shut down toxin production. Vancomycin can be added for MRSA coverage. If mixed infection is possible, a broad-spectrum penicillin with anaerobic coverage (piperacillin/tazobactam) should be used.

ComPliCations If it is not treated early, the condition may rapidly progress to compartment syndrome, shock, multiorgan failure, and death.

Periorbital/Orbital Infections

■ Hx/PE: Differentiating between periorbital (preseptal) and orbital infec- tion is critical, as management differs significantly. Although both present with erythema and pain, orbital infections may also present with oculomo- tor dysfunction, proptosis, chemosis, worsening pain on eye movement, and ↓ visual acuity.

■ Dx: The diagnosis of preseptal cellulitis is typically clinical. If there is concern or suspicion for orbital infection, obtain a CT of the orbit (see Figure 10-4), blood cultures, and a CBC with differential.

■ Tx: Preseptal cellulitis can be managed on an outpatient basis with anti- biotics that cover skin flora (S aureus, Streptococcus spp). Orbital celluli- tis requires broad-spectrum IV antimicrobials to cover gram-negative

======================================
Acute Osteomyelitis

Infection of the bone that is spread by direct inoculation or, less commonly, through hematogenous dissemination (except in pediatrics where hematoge- nous osteomyelitis is common). Those with peripheral vascular disease, diabe- tes, and recent orthopedic surgery are at ↑ risk.

History/PE Presents with pain with overlying erythema, edema, and tenderness. Patients may have an overlying ulcer or skin interruption. Systemic symptoms include fevers, chills, and fatigue.

DiffErEntial Cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis.

Diagnosis ■ Obtain blood cultures, CBC, and ESR/CRP. ESR and CRP are usually ↑,

but blood cultures may remain ⊝.

■ Obtain plain films of the suspected area of infection. These may be nor- mal, as infection must have been present for 10–14 days before changes are seen on x-ray. Periosteal elevation is a typical x-ray finding associated with osteomyelitis. ■

If plain films are normal, proceed to MRI. If plain films or MRI/bone scan are abnormal, obtain a bone biopsy with culture for definitive diagnosis.

trEatmEnt ■ Start with broad coverage and narrow once the organism has been identi- fied. Treatment duration is 4–6 weeks of oral or IV antimicrobial therapy. ■ The most common organism is S aureus. Consider Salmonella if the patient has sickle cell anemia and consider Pseudomonas in the setting of IV drug use or diabetes.

■ Axial skeleton osteomyelitis can resolve with antimicrobials alone, but all other cases require surgical debridement for cure.

|_|

Septic Arthritis

Infection of a joint. Risk factors include recent instrumentation of a joint (injection, arthroscopy, arthroplasty), joint damage (osteoarthritis, trauma, RA), a prosthetic joint, gonococcal infection, and bacteremia. Commonly caused by skin flora.

■ Think of disseminated gonococcal infections in sexually active young adults.

■ Staphylococcus epidermidis is common in prosthetic joints.

History/PE Presents as an erythematous, warm, swollen, and painful joint with ↓ range of motion. Gonococcal septic arthritis may present with multiple infected joints and rash. Systemic symptoms include fever and chills.

DiffErEntial ■ Trauma, hemarthrosis (spontaneous or traumatic), crystalline arthropathy,

and autoimmune disease may all present with a similar joint exam.

■ Autoimmune disease may present with systemic symptoms similar to those of septic arthritis.

■ Septic arthritis may be concurrent with any of these processes; therefore, diagnosis relies on arthrocentesis.

Diagnosis ■ Arthrocentesis is required for definitive diagnosis. Send fluid for Gram

stain, culture, cell count/differential, and crystal analysis.

■ Obtain blood cultures.

trEatmEnt ■

Initiate empiric antibiotics promptly after joint aspiration based on Gram stain. Narrow coverage once the organism has been identified.

■ Surgical management with washout and 4–6 weeks of directed antimicro- bials are necessary for appropriate management.

ComPliCations Joint destruction, sepsis, and death.

Encephalitis

Encephalitis

Involves the brain parenchyma; herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the leading cause. Patients may have nonspecific complaints that are initially consistent with a viral prodrome (eg, fever, malaise, body aches) and may subsequently develop confusion, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. Headaches, photo- phobia, and meningeal signs may be seen in meningoencephalitis.

H E R P E S S I M P L E X V I R U S E N C E P H A L I T I S

■ Most cases are due to HSV-1 reactivation. ■ Hx/PE: Think of HSV encephalitis when patients present with bizarre behavior, speech disorders, gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, or acute hearing impairment.

■ Dx: Key cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies include HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and to a lesser extent HSV culture. MRI (see Figure 10-5) will show a characteristic pattern in the temporal lobes, usu- ally bilaterally.

■ Tx: Treat empirically with IV acyclovir.

W E S T N I L E E N C E P H A L I T I S

Bacterial Meningitis

Common causative organisms vary with age (see Table 10-1).

History/PE ■ Typical symptoms include fever, malaise, headaches, photophobia, and

neck stiffness. Patients may also complain of nausea and vomiting.

■ Nuchal rigidity, Kernig sign, Brudzinski sign, or “jolt sign.”

Diagnosis ■ Obtain LP in any patient suspected of having meningitis. ■ When clinical features suggest a possible intracranial mass or ↑ intracra- nial pressure or if the patient has altered mental status or focal neurologic defects, obtain a head CT before LP.

■ Obtain blood cultures before administering antibiotics. See Table 10-2 for CSF findings in meningitis.

trEatmEnt ■ Begin empiric therapy immediately after obtaining blood cultures in any- one suspected of having bacterial meningitis, as even a short delay will ↑ mortality. Antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed if LP cannot be performed immediately.

■ Consider the patient’s risk factors and then choose an antimicrobial regi- men that will cover the most likely organisms (see Table 10-3).

■ Administer dexamethasone before administering antibiotics if S pneu- moniae is suspected, as this ↓ mortality.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: Amoxicillin. Use amoxicillin/clavulanate if a history of recur-

rent otitis or if no improvement on amoxicillin.

■ Patients who do not respond to antimicrobial therapy or who develop hear- ing loss should have tympanostomy tubes placed.

O T I T I S E X T E R N A

■ Predisposing factors include swimming, eczema, hearing aid use, and mechanical trauma (eg, cotton swab insertion). In most patients, the caus- ative organism is Pseudomonas. S aureus is implicated in acute otitis externa. ■ Hx/PE: Patients have a painful ear along with foul-smelling drainage. The external ear canal is typically swollen and erythematous. There may also be pus. Patients have tenderness upon movement of the pinna or tragus. ■ Tx: Remove any foreign material from the ear canal and start a topical

antimicrobial (typically ofloxacin) with steroids.

P H A R Y N G I T I S

Typically due to viral causes. Group A streptococcus is implicated in up to 25% of cases. Untreated group A streptococcal infection can result in acute pyogenic complications and rheumatic fever (fever, arthritis, carditis, chorea, rash).

History/PE Symptoms include sore throat and fever +/− cough. Look for tonsillar exu- dates and tender anterior cervical adenopathy.

Diagnosis ■ Calculate the Centor score to determine the likelihood of streptococcal infection and the need for rapid streptococcal antigen testing (see Table 10-4).

■ Rapid streptococcal antigen testing is the best initial test; culture is the most accurate.

■ Think about infectious mononucleosis in patients with cervical lymphade-

nopathy, malaise, and/or splenomegaly. In adults with pharyngitis, always consider HIV infection and acute retro- viral syndrome. In children, think about epiglottitis (febrile patients with complaints of severe sore throat and dysphagia with minimal findings on exam).

■

■

trEatmEnt ■ Treat group A streptococcal infections with penicillin. Use a macrolide

such as azithromycin for patients with penicillin allergy.

■ Chronic carriers (ie, those who have a ⊕ throat culture or are asymptom- atic) should be treated with clindamycin for eradication.

USMLE_FA_Step3_5e_ch10_169-198.indd 178

INFECTIOUS DISEASE

History/PE ■ Think of pneumonia in any patient with acute onset of fever, productive

cough, dyspnea, and/or pleuritic chest pain.

■ Atypical organisms may present with low-grade fever, nonproductive cough, and myalgias (“walking pneumonia”). However, they may also present typically as above.

■ Look for evidence of consolidation (dullness to percussion, crackles, egophony) on lung exam.

Diagnosis ■ There should be radiographic evidence of an infiltrate in all immunocom- petent patients (see Figure 10-7) as well as recovery of a pathogenic organ- ism from blood, sputum, or pleural fluid.

■ Consider sending urine Legionella antigen and urine S pneumoniae antigen in patients who require ICU admission, fail outpatient antibiotic therapy, have alcohol use disorder, or have a pleural effusion. Asplenic patients and those with chronic liver disease should also be screened for S pneumoniae.

■ Remember to check arterial blood gas to determine the acid-base status of

patients who appear to be in distress. If the patient is hospitalized, check blood cultures.

trEatmEnt ■ Use the CURB-65 score to determine the need for hospital admission. Patients get 1 point for each of the following: Confusion, Urea > 19 mg/ dL, Respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, Blood pressure (systolic < 90, diastolic ≤ 60), and age ≥ 65. Patients with a score of 2 or more should be hospitalized. Initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy based on the patient’s risk factors (eg, community-dwelling, healthy vs diabetic).

Genitourinary Tract Infections

C Y S T I T I S

■ Uncomplicated infection of the lower urinary tract (ie, cystitis): A symp- tomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in a patient with normal immunity and a normal GU tract with no prior instrumentation. Infections are com- mon; approximately 10% of US women have at least one uncomplicated UTI each year.

■ Complicated UTIs: Infections occurring in patients with functional or structural abnormalities of the GU tract, recent instrumentation of the urinary tract, or immune compromise (eg, patients with diabetes, preg- nant women, transplant patients). UTIs in which symptoms are present for > 7 days are also considered complicated.

■ Hx/PE: Dysuria, urgency, and frequency of urination are the most com- mon complaints. Patients usually do not have a fever.

■ DDx: Think about urethritis/cervicitis in sexually active patients. Renal stones may also present with colicky pain and dysuria.

■ Dx: Check a UA for the presence of bacteria, WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites.

■ Tx: Uncomplicated UTIs: Give a 3-day course of TMP-SMX, a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin, or single-dose fosfomycin. Use fluoroquinolones or β-lactams only if the previous agents are contraindicated. Complicated UTIs: May be treated with oral fluoroquinolones but often require IV antibiotics.

P Y E LO N E P H R I T I S

■ ■ Hx/PE: Findings are like those of cystitis, with the addition of back or flank pain, cerebrovascular accident tenderness, and systemic symptoms such as fever/chills.

■ Dx: Urine specimens usually demonstrate significant bacteriuria, pyuria, and occasional WBC casts. A urine culture and blood culture should be sent on all patients.

KEY FACT

Always obtain blood cultures on admission, as 15–20% of patients will be bacteremic.

■ Tx: Mild infection may be treated on an outpatient basis with a fluoro- quinolone. Otherwise, hospitalization for IV antibiotics is required. If there is no clinical response, order CT or ultrasound to look for an intrarenal or perinephric abscess or an obstruction such as a renal cal- culus or stricture.

P R O S TAT I T I S

■ Hx/PE: Presenting symptoms include fevers, chills, dysuria, cloudy urine, and even obstructive symptoms if prostate swelling is significant. In patients with chronic infection, low back pain or perineal/testicular dis- comfort may be present. The gland is exquisitely tender on prostate digital rectal exam.

■ Dx: Obtain urine cultures before and after a prostatic massage. In addition to typical organisms like E coli, think of atypical organisms such as Chla- mydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

■ Tx: Treat acute bacterial prostatitis with a fluoroquinolone or IV piper- acillin/tazobactam or with a third-generation cephalosporin for 14 days. Treat chronic bacterial prostatitis with a fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX for 4–6 weeks.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases

INFECTIOUS DISEASE

■ 2° syphilis: After the chancre has resolved, patients may develop malaise, anorexia, headache, diffuse lymphadenopathy, or rash (involves the muco- sal surfaces, palms, and soles).

■ 3° syphilis: Includes cardiovascular, neurologic, and gummatous disease (eg, general paresis, tabes dorsalis, aortitis, meningovascular syphilis).

Diagnosis ■ 1°: Nontreponemal tests (RPR or VDRL) are used for screening. Send a specific treponemal serologic test (FTA-ABS, MHA-TP, or syphilis enzyme immunoassay) for confirmation. Darkfield microscopy of the exudate will show the spirochetes.

■ 2°: Diagnose by the presence of clinical illness and ⊕ serologic tests. ■ 3°: Perform an LP in the presence of neurologic or ophthalmic signs and symptoms, in the setting of treatment failure, or with a VDRL of ≥ 1:32. Correlate with cardiovascular, neurologic, and systemic symptoms.

trEatmEnt ■ 1°/2°: Penicillin G 2.4 MU in a single IM dose. Alternatives include doxy- cycline or erythromycin for 14 days. If the disease duration is unknown or > 1 year, give three doses of penicillin G IM 1 week apart.

■ Neurosyphilis or syphilis in pregnant patients: Penicillin G IV. If a patient is penicillin sensitive, desensitization is necessary.
======================================
G E N I TA L H E R P E S

■ Painful grouped vesicles in the anogenital region. Caused by the human HSV, usually type 2.

■ Hx/PE: Frequently associated symptoms include tender inguinal lymph- adenopathy, fever, myalgias, headaches, and aseptic meningitis. Symptoms are usually more pronounced during the initial episode and grow less fre- quent with recurrences.

■ Dx: Can be confirmed by viral PCR, by direct fluorescent antibody stain or by culture of the vesicle fluid.

■ Tx: Acyclovir or valacyclovir for 1° infections. Treatment should begin within 48 hours of symptom onset. Severe recurrences may necessitate repeat treatment with either acyclovir or valacyclovir. Daily suppressive therapy can be used for frequent recurrences.

C E R V I C I T I S / U R E T H R I T I S

■ Chlamydial and gonococcal infections often present as cervicitis or ure- thritis. Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging pathogen.

■ Hx/PE: Dysuria, dyspareunia, and a mucopurulent vaginal discharge are frequent complaints in women. In men, dysuria and a purulent penile dis- charge predominate.

■ Dx: A ⊕ endocervical or urethral culture or a ⊕ urine PCR for chla- mydia/gonorrhea is diagnostic.

■ Tx: Consists of simultaneous treatment for both infections and for sexual partners. Treat chlamydia with a single PO dose of azithromycin. Treat gonorrhea with a single IM dose of ceftriaxone.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE

HIV Infection

Acute retroviral syndrome occurs in 50–90% of cases. The incubation period is usually 2–6 weeks. Acute symptoms last 1–4 weeks, with an aver- age of 2 weeks.

History/PE Patients have a typical viral prodrome (eg, malaise, low-grade fever) followed by the development of adenopathy. Unusual presentations include Bell palsy, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, cognitive impairment, and psychosis.

Diagnosis ■ The CDC recommends fourth-generation HIV serology (enzyme immu- noassay [EIA]) that detects both antibody to HIV and HIV antigen for HIV screening. Serology becomes ⊕ 2–3 weeks after exposure. A confirmatory Western blot is no longer used.

■ For patients with suspected acute retroviral syndrome, check a viral load, as the EIA may not have had time to turn ⊕.

trEatmEnt ■ Begin antiretroviral therapy in all patients with HIV regardless of CD4

count. This includes asymptomatic patients and pregnant women.

■ Counsel pregnant women with HIV to avoid breastfeeding to ↓ the risk of HIV transmission.

■ Start postexposure prophylaxis within 72 hours of a needlestick involving blood or for sexual exposure to individuals with HIV.

■ Regimens should include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a third drug from a different category (see Table 10-8).

ComPliCations Complications are numerous and typically involve opportunistic infections and side effects from drugs. See Table 10-9 for prophylaxis indications.

Travel Medicine
======================================
F E V E R I N T H E R E T U R N E D T R A V E L E R

Patients who present with a fever after international travel must be evaluated for tropical illnesses. Always consider common illnesses such as URI or UTI as causes of fever.

History/PE/Diagnosis ■ Obtain a thorough travel history, including location of travel, immuniza- tion status, food precautions taken (or not taken), and sexual exposures. ■ Look for rashes, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and neurologic status on exam. Altered mental status after travel is considered a medical emergency. Initial evaluation should include a CBC with differential, a complete met- abolic panel, blood cultures, thin and thick smears for malaria, and a UA and culture.

■ See Table 10-10 for a list of possible causes, presentations, and treatment.

Infectious Diarrhea

■ Hx/PE: Diarrhea usually associated with abdominal pain +/− fever. Bloody diarrhea is typically due to enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC), Campylobacter, Shigella, and occasionally Salmonella.

■ DDx: Inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic bowel, Whipple disease, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, neuroendo- crine disorders.

■ Dx: Clinical diagnosis. Because most cases of diarrhea are self-limited, studies are not usually warranted. For patients with blood in the stool, fever, and severe abdominal pain, obtain a stool sample to examine for fecal leukocytes and send for culture. Bloodwork may show leukocytosis, evidence of dehydration, hemolysis, or renal failure.

■ Tx: The most important treatment is fluid resuscitation; in children, use oral rehydration therapy. Avoid antimotility agents. For travelers, consider an empiric fluoroquinolone or azithromycin if severe. Avoid antimicrobi- als in EHEC, as this could precipitate hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

C L O S T R I D I U M D I F F I C I L E C O L I T I S

■ Risk factors include recent antimicrobial use (other than metronidazole), recent hospitalization, and proton pump inhibitor use.

■ Hx/PE: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting (if ileus). PE shows diffuse thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

■ Dx: Stool EIA for toxins A and B followed by confirmatory cell cytotoxic assay/oxygenic culture or PCR. Also check KUB or CT of the abdomen and pelvis for toxic megacolon or associated ileus.

Neutropenic Fever

In a patient with neutropenic fever, do not conduct a digital rectal examination unless perirectal abscess is suspected.

Most often occurs after chemotherapy. Defined as a single temperature of > 38.3°C (101.3°F) or a sustained temperature of > 38°C (100.4°F) for > 1 hour in a neutropenic patient (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] = poly- morphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs] + bands < 500).

5

KEY FACT

Elderly patients or those on corticosteroids may not be able to mount a fever that meets the diagnostic criteria for neutropenic fever.

History/PE ■ The skin should be examined for signs of erythema, rash, cellulitis, ulcers,

or line infection.

■ All indwelling lines should be carefully examined for subtle signs of infec- tion, as erythema, tenderness, fluctuance, or exudate may be the only evi- dence of a serious “tunnel infection.”

Diagnosis ■ Obtain a CBC with differential, a complete metabolic panel, amylase,

lipase, and a CXR.

■ Obtain at least two sets of blood cultures and urine cultures. Consider sending stool and sputum cultures if clinically indicated. LP is warranted only if CNS symptoms are present.

trEatmEnt ■ Empiric antimicrobials should cover Pseudomonas. Use cefepime IV or a

carbapenem IV.

■ Consider vancomycin in patients with a history of MRSA infections, hypo- tension, persistent fever on empiric therapy, or skin or catheter site infections.

■ Think about fungal infections (especially Candida and Aspergillus) in patients with 4–7 days of persistent fever despite empiric antibiotic ther- apy, and begin amphotericin B, micafungin, or voriconazole.

Sepsis

Defined as two or more SIRS criteria with evidence of infection. Divided into three levels of severity (see Table 10-12). SIRS criteria are as follows:

■ Temperature: < 36°C (< 96.8°F) or > 38°C (> 100.4°F). ■ HR: > 90 bpm. ■ Respiratory rate: > 20 breaths/min or a Pco2 of < 32 mm Hg. ■ Leukocytes: > 12,000 cells/mm3, < 4000 cells/mm3, or > 10% bands on

KEY FACT

Aggressive fluid resuscitation and early initiation of appropriate antimicrobials is critical in the management of sepsis.

a |!

This patient is septic. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and broad- spectrum antibiotics should be initiated immediately to reduce mortality.

USMLE_FA_Step3_5e_ch10_169-198.indd 192

INFECTIOUS DISEASE

History/PE ■ Presents with nonspecific infectious symptoms such as fever, chills, and

fatigue.

■ Symptoms and signs suggestive of cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, meningi- tis, sinusitis, pneumonia, endocarditis, UTI, or GI infection are seen.

■ Vital signs may be abnormal (see the SIRS criteria above). ■ Evidence of hypoperfusion includes cool, pale extremities, ↓ pulses, altered

mental status, and ↓ urine output.

Diagnosis ■ Find the focus of infection based on the history and PE. ■ Always obtain blood cultures and sensitivities. ■ Obtain a serum lactate to evaluate for end-organ hypoperfusion.

trEatmEnt ■ Early antimicrobial therapy and fluid resuscitation have been shown to

↓ mortality and are therefore critical to the management of sepsis.

■ The initial choice of antimicrobials should be based on the likely source or should be broad spectrum if the source is unclear. These should be tai- lored based on culture data. Initiate aggressive fluid resuscitation with a goal of 30 mL/kg in the first 6 hours. If this fails to achieve a mean arterial pressure > 65 mm Hg and urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/h, initiation of vasopressors may be necessary. ■ Consider central-line access for cardiovascular and pulmonary monitoring as well as administration of high-volume fluid resuscitation, blood prod- ucts, and/or pressors/inotropes.

■ Consider an arterial line for continuous monitoring of BP.

ComPliCations Can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiorgan failure, and death.

Staphylococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome

A systemic response to staphylococcal infection, resulting in shock with multi- organ failure. Caused by toxic shock syndrome (TSS) toxin-1, a staphylococ- cal exotoxin that acts as a superantigen, activating multiple T cells at once and leading to massive cytokine release.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE

History/PE ■ Fever, hypotension, a diffuse macular rash followed by desquamation (1–2 weeks later), and multiorgan failure (eg, diarrhea/vomiting, myalgias/ rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, liver failure, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status).

■ Think of staphylococcal TSS in menstruating women (tampons can serve as a nidus for infection), in patients with nasal packing for epistaxis, in women with postpartum wounds, and in postsurgical patients with wounds that might serve as a source of infection.

Diagnosis Check blood, wound, and/or vaginal cultures for Staphylococcus.

trEatmEnt ■ Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation is essential owing to capillary leak caused

by cytokine release.

■ Any foreign bodies in the vaginal canal or nose should be removed. If related to an infected wound, fluid collections should be drained.

■ Antibiotic treatment should include a penicillinase-resistant penicillin for methicillin-susceptible S aureus or vancomycin for MRSA. All patients should be started on clindamycin to stop protein/toxin synthesis.

|_|

Fungal Infections

Typically affect immunocompromised patients and should always be consid- ered in this population but may also affect healthy adults. Consider fungal infection in the neutropenic patient with persistent fevers for 4–7 days despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Fungus morphology may be as a yeast with spores, as a mold with hyphae, or both (see Table 10-13). Fungi that can pres- ent with both morphologies are referred to as dimorphic fungi and grow as a mold at room temperature and as a yeast at body temperature.

Antimicrobial Selection

When a pathogen has been definitively identified, it is important to choose an antimicrobial with narrow coverage. Table 10-14 reviews selected antimicrobi- als and their spectra of coverage, mechanisms of action, and common adverse effects.

KEY FACT

Libman-Sacks endocarditis, also known as verrucous endocarditis, is characterized by noninfectious, granular, pea-sized masses near the edge of a valve or valve ring. It typically affects both surfaces of the valve leaflet.

■ Anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (60% of patients) highly specific. ■ Anti-Sm antibodies highly specific for lupus. ■ Antihistone antibodies can be seen in drug-related lupus-like symptoms

and primary SLE.

■ Often false-positive test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]). ■ Antiphospholipid (anticardiolipin) antibodies. ■ Decreased C3 and C4 (most notable in acute flares).

trEatmEnt ■ NSAIDs are used for arthritis and mild serositis. ■ Hydroxychloroquine are used to treat skin and renal symptoms. ■ Steroids and immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine), including biologic agents that target B cells (belimumab, rituximab), are used for refractory or serious cases.

■ Active flare-ups are treated with steroid tapers. ■ Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome need lifelong anticoag-

ulation with warfarin.

■ Thrombosis, embolism, and hypercoagulability (antiphospholipid syn- drome) can increase risk of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and miscarriages.

■ Mortality in SLE is frequently due to accelerated atherosclerosis, infec- tions, malignancy, or renal disease.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

A chronic inflammatory disorder that affects peripheral synovial joints sym- metrically triggering synovial hypertrophy by replacing synovial cartilage with fibrosing granulation tissue. Extra-articular manifestations include pulmonary fibrosis, serositis, vasculitis, and rheumatoid nodules. Risk factors include middle-aged female and serotype HLA-DR4.

History/PE ■ Constitutional: Malaise, weight loss, fever, scleritis, episcleritis, Sjögren

syndrome.

■ Musculoskeletal: Morning stiffness, pain and swelling, decreased mobil- ity, Boutonniere (flexed proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joint), Swan neck deformities (flexed distal interphalangeal [DIP] joint with hyperextended PIP), ulnar deviation—typically symmetrical involving metacarpophalan- geal (MCP) joint and PIP, sparing the DIP (see Figure 11-2).

■ Skin: Subcutaneous nodules (“rheumatoid” nodules). ■ Pulmonary/cardiac/vascular: Pleuritis, pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis,

myocarditis, vasculitis.

Diagnosis ■ Requires the presence of four or more of the following criteria for 6 weeks: ■ Arthritis of 3 or more joint areas, most commonly the PIP, MCP,

wrist, elbow, knee, or ankle.

■ Rheumatoid nodules, most commonly found at the elbow. ■ Labs: ↑ C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF) ⊕ in 75% of patients, anti-cyclic citrul- linated peptide (anti-CCP) (most specific to RA).

■ Radiographic: Classic changes are symmetric joint space narrowing; periarticular osteoporosis with erosions around the affected MCP and PIP joints also common features on x-ray (see Figure 11-3).

■ Joint aspiration: Inflammatory fluid.

Osteoarthritis

A chronic, noninflammatory joint disease characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage, hypertrophy of the bone margins, and synovial mem- brane changes. Osteoarthritis (OA) may be 1° or 2° to trauma or a systemic metabolic disorder (hemochromatosis, Wilson disease).

History/PE ■ Marked by insidious onset of joint pain without inflammatory signs. ■

In contrast to the “morning stiffness” of inflammatory arthritis, OA wors- ens with activity during the day and improves with rest. Morning stiffness has a duration of < 30 minutes.

Gout

Peripheral monoarthritis caused by intra-articular deposition of monosodium urate crystals resulting in inflammatory changes and joint destruction. May be due to hyperuricemia from excessive urate production or from ↓ renal uric acid excretion. Risk factors include male sex, Pacific Islanders, renal disease, obesity, diuretic use, consumption of purine-rich foods, cancer.

History/PE ■ Constitutional: Fever, chills, malaise. ■ Musculoskeletal: Typically monoarticular with sudden pain and swelling of first metatarsophalangeal joint (most common), ankle, knee, elbow. ■ Patients with long-standing disease may develop tophi that lead to joint

deformation.

■ Renal: Complications of chronic hyperuricemia include nephrolithiasis and chronic urate nephropathy.

T A B L E 1 1 - 1 . Interpretation of Joint Aspiration
======================================

KEY FACT

Monoarthritis? Think: ■ Gout ■ Septic arthritis ■ Lyme disease ■ Pseudogout ■ Trauma

DiffErEntial Calcium pyrophosphate crystal disease (pseudogout) is often associated with other diseases (DM, hyperparathyroidism, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis) and is typically seen in patients < 65 years of age. Joint aspiration shows posi- tively birefringent, rhomboid crystal. X-ray shows chondrocalcinosis.

Diagnosis ■ Acute gout attacks often occur at night between periods of remission. The three stages are acute gouty arthritis, intercritical gout, and chronic recur- rent and tophaceous gout.

■ Common precipitants of attacks include a high-purine diet (eg, meats, alcohol), dehydration or diuretic use (thiazides), high-fructose corn syrup, stress, severe illness, trauma, and tumor lysis syndrome.

■ Best initial test: Arthrocentesis. Joint aspiration from warm, swollen joints helps distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory disease as well as infectious from hemorrhagic processes (see Table 11-1). In gout, joint aspi- rate is inflammatory with needle-shaped, negatively birefringent (yeLLow when paraLLel to the condenser or axis of polarization) crystals (see Figure 11-7 and Table 11-2).

Hydrochlorothiazide and other thiazide diuretics interfere with the excretion of uric acid, thereby exacerbating gout.

■ Radiographs: Normal in early gout. Characteristic punched-out erosions with overhanging cortical bone (“rat bites”) are seen in advanced disease (see Figure 11-8).

trEatmEnt ■ Acute attacks: High-dose NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin), corticosteroids (PO, intra-articular) and colchicine are useful if started within the first 24 hours of an attack. Side effects of colchicine include diarrhea, nausea, and bone marrow suppression.

■ Maintenance therapy: Only begin once the acute attack resolves; start allopurinol to reduce the risk of recurrence by lowering serum uric acid levels. Allopurinol can be continued if patient is already taking it prior to gout attack.

■ Lifestyle changes: Encourage a low-purine diet (eggs, cheese, fruit, and vegetables). Weight loss and BP control can also prevent flares.

Low Back Pain

Leading cause of missed work days in the United States. Causes are shown in Table 11-3.

Diagnosis ■ Neurologic exam to determine if the spinal nerves are affected (see Table 11-4). Suspect spinal cord involvement if the Babinski reflex is upgoing or if there is sphincter laxity. An UPgoing toe is an UPper motor neuron sign.

■ Straight leg raise test: If ⊕ (in which a supine patient experiences leg, buttock, or back pain in the affected leg at < 30° of elevation of the affected leg) is sensitive for spinal nerve irritation or radiculopathy.

■ Crossed straight leg raise test: If ⊕ (in which a supine patient experi- ences leg, buttock, or back pain in the affected leg at < 30° of elevation of the unaffected leg) is specific for spinal nerve irritation.

■ Imaging: Order a lumbar spine x-ray for patients in whom osteomyelitis, cancer, fractures, or ankylosing spondylitis is suspected or for those who fail to improve after 2–4 weeks of conservative therapy. Consider screening for osteoporosis if fractures are seen on x-ray. An MRI should be ordered if cauda equina syndrome is suspected or if the patient has neurologic defi- cits for which surgery is being considered.

trEatmEnt ■ Cauda equina syndrome or spinal nerve involvement require surgical

evaluation.

■ Degenerative Low Back Pain (LBP): Treated with NSAIDs and physiotherapy.

■ Ankylosing spondylitis: Treated with TNF inhibitors and physiotherapy (see below).

■ Most LBP from disk herniation will improve within 6 weeks; surgery should be considered in cases of progressive neurologic deficits.

New-onset dermatomyo- sitis requires age-appropriate cancer screening because of its high associa- tion with internal malignancy.

Diagnosis ■ Look for ↑ CK and aldolase. ■ Electromyography demonstrates fibrillations. Muscle biopsy, which is necessary for definitive diagnosis, shows inflammatory cells and muscle degeneration.

■ Methotrexate or azathioprine may be used as steroid-sparing therapy or for refractory symptoms.

Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)

A multisystem disease with symmetric thickening of the skin on the face and extremities. It typically affects women 30–65 years of age. Diagnosis is clinical and is supported by biopsy. There are two subtypes: limited and systemic (see Table 11-5).

Diagnosis ■

In the presence of characteristic clinical findings, consider ANA as a screening test. Other tests include anti-topoisomerase I antibody (anti- Scl-70), which is highly specific but not sensitive.

■ Skin biopsy is generally not essential for confirmation of the diagnosis.

CHAPTER 12

NEPHROLOGY

Acute Kidney Injury

An abrupt impairment in renal function that leads to the accumulation of waste products (eg, urea nitrogen) normally eliminated by the kidneys.

■ Defined as a rise in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours. ■ Further classified into prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal injuries (see

Table 12-1).

History/PE ■ Patients are often asymptomatic but may present with dyspnea, edema/ anasarca, uremic symptoms (eg, anorexia, nausea, malaise, hyperpig- mented skin, asterixis, pericarditis [listen for a friction rub]), and anemia. ■ Exam should include checking blood pressure, weighing daily, and assess- ing volume status. Other findings are specific to the etiology of the renal failure.

Diagnosis ■ Obtain urine sodium (UNa) and urine creatinine (UCr) to calculate a frac- tional excretion of sodium (FeNa). The following FeNa formula can be used to differentiate the two most common causes of acute kidney injury (AKI)—prerenal injury and acute tubular necrosis (ATN):

(UNa × PCr) / (UCr × PNa) × 100

5

KEY FACT

■ Fractional excretion of urea (Feurea) should be calculated in the place of FeNa for patients taking diuretics, as these medications raise the concentra- tion of UNa. Feurea is calculated as follows:

Anything that reduces renal blood flow can cause both a prerenal and intrinsic renal injury (eg, ATN caused by renal ischemia).

(UUr × PCr) / (UCr × PUr) × 100

■ Feurea of < 35% suggests a prerenal state. ■ Feurea of > 50% suggests intrinsic renal disease. ■ Order urine microscopy for sediment and cast analysis.

History/PE Often asymptomatic at Na+ concentrations > 130 mEq/L, symptoms can progress to nausea, seizures, and coma at lower values.

Diagnosis Assess volume status and check serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium (see Figure 12-1).

trEatmEnt ■ Acute or chronic hyponatremia with severe symptoms (eg, seizure,

coma): Infuse hypertonic saline.

■ Asymptomatic hyponatremia and hyponatremia with mild symptoms: Correction should occur at a rate of approximately 0.5 mEq/L/hr with a goal increase of 8–10 mEq/L per day. Treatment is based on the patient’s fluid status. ■ Hypervolemia: Administer loop diuretic. ■ Euvolemia: Restrict fluid to 1 L/day, administer loop diuretic, high-

sodium diet/salt tabs for poor solute intake.

History/PE May be asymptomatic or present with muscle weakness/paralysis and cardiac arrhythmias.

Diagnosis ■ ECG may show T-wave flattening and U waves (an additional wave after

the T wave).

■ The underlying cause is often clear based on the history (eg, patient taking

loop diuretics). If diagnosis is unclear based on history: ■ Check 24-hour urine K+ or spot urine K+. ■ Assess acid base status.

■ 24-hour urine K+ > 30 mEq/L: Indicates that the kidneys are wasting K+. ■ Metabolic acidosis: Type I renal tubular acidosis (RTA), Type II RTA,

amphotericin, diabetic ketoacidosis.

■ Metabolic alkalosis: 1° hyperaldosteronism (high aldosterone/low renin), Cushing syndrome (check 24-hour urine cortisol), diuretics (loop or thiazide), Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome.

■ 24-hour urine K+ < 20 mEq/L: Indicates that the kidneys are NOT the

source of K+ loss. ■ Metabolic acidosis: Laxative abuse. ■ Metabolic alkalosis: Vomiting, NG suctioning.

trEatmEnt ■ Manage the underlying disorder (antiemetic therapy). ■ Provide oral and/or IV K+ repletion.

Defined as K+ concentrations ≥ 5 mEq/L.

History/PE May be asymptomatic or present with muscle weakness/paralysis or cardiac arrhythmias.

Diagnosis ■ An ECG may show peaked T-waves (Figure 12-3). ■ Assess renal function: Acute and chronic kidney disease are associated with

hyperkalemia.

■ Medications are often implicated: Spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, triamterene, ACEI/ARB, digoxin.

■ Assess acid base status: Metabolic acidosis is associated with hyperkalemia.

trEatmEnt ■ K+ > 6.5 mEq/L or ECG changes (peaked T-waves or wide QRS) require emergent treatment (see the mnemonic “C BIG K Drop”). Calcium glu- conate should be given immediately to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.

■ Temporary treatment includes β2-agonists, insulin with glucose, and sodium bicarbonate.

======================================
KEY FACT

Vomiting is associated with hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. The loss of gastric contents, including hydrochloric acid, results in renal reabsorption of acid (H+) in place of K+, which is excreted in the urine.

KEY FACT

Replacement of K+ is difficult when hypomagnesemia is present. Replete both deficiencies if present.

5

KEY FACT

In metabolic acidosis, H+ are shuffled intracellularly in an attempt to reduce the extracellular pH. The movement of H+ across the cellular membrane requires an exchange with K+, which moves extracellularly resulting in hyperkalemia.

======================================
Nephrotic and Nephritic Syndromes

Disorders of the glomerulus.

■ Nephrotic syndrome: Due to loss of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) function; results in loss of large plasma proteins into the urine, which is responsible for many of the manifestations associated with the syndrome.

■ Nephritic syndrome: Due to inflammation of the glomerulus; results in loss of RBCs and large plasma proteins into the urine.

See Table 12-3 for a comparison of nephrotic and nephritic syndromes and Tables 12-4 to 12-6 for various causes of each. Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome are those that are caused by systemic disease. Examples include dia- betic nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and renal amyloidosis (see Table 12-5).

Nephrolithiasis

Kidney stones form when the urine is supersaturated with solutes resulting in solute precipitation and crystal formation. Risk factors include low urinary output, male gender, ⊕ family history, gout, chronic diarrhea, diabetes, and obesity. Additionally, those taking indinavir, acyclovir, or triamterene are at an ↑ risk for drug-induced urinary calculi. See Table 12-7 for the four major types of kidney stones.

History/PE May present with acute flank pain with radiation to the anterior abdomen or ipsilateral testicle/labium. Gross hematuria is common.

A 38-year-old woman with HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy has a 2-day history of fevers and right flank pain. Exam reveals right costovertebral angle tenderness. UA shows 20– 50 RBCs/hpf and 20–50 WBCs/hpf. CT reveals moderate right-sided hydronephrosis along with perinephric and periureteral stranding. Two hours after presentation, her BP goes from 120/75 to 82/50 and her temperature is 40.1°C (104.2°F). What is the next best step in management? Which antiretroviral drug could be implicated in this case?

Diagnosis ■ Clinical suspicion + imaging—noncontrast CT scan (see Figure 12-4) or

1. Identify the 1° disorder:

A defect in the proximal tubular amino acid cysteine transporters results in high urinary concentrations of the amino acid.

■ Metabolic acidosis: pH < 7.40, HCO3 < 24. ■ Metabolic alkalosis: pH > 7.40, HCO3 > 24. ■ Respiratory acidosis: pH < 7.40, Pco2 > 40. ■ Respiratory alkalosis: pH > 7.40, Pco2 < 40.

2. Assess compensation:

======================================
yy

Urease-producing bacteria (eg, Klebsiella or Proteus).

Paco2 = 1.5 × [HCO3] + 8 +/− 2

If Paco2 is more than expected, it suggests concurrent respiratory acidosis. If Paco2 is less than expected, it suggests concurrent respiratory alkalosis.

3

The patient’s findings—a pH < 7.40 and HCO3 < 24 mEq/L plus a Paco2 that is lower than the expected compensation of Paco2 27–31 mm Hg—indicate a mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. This is most commonly seen in aspirin poisoning.

■ Expected compensation in acute respiratory acidosis (onset < 2 days): ■ ↑ of 1 mEq/L HCO3 above 24 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg ↑ in

T of 1 mEq/L HCO; above 24 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg T

Paco2 above 40 mm Hg. If the change in HCO3 is more, it suggests concurrent metabolic alkalosis. If the change in HCO3 is less, it suggests concurrent metabolic acidosis.

If the change in HCO3 is less, it suggests concurrent metabolic alkalosis.

3. Miscellaneous additional calculations for metabolic acidosis:

■ Always calculate the anion gap (AG) using: AG = (Na − [HCO3 + Cl]). If the AG is ≥ 14, a high AG metabolic acidosis exists (see the mnemonic GOLDMARK).

■ Always calculate the delta ratio for high AG metabolic acidosis using:

(AG − 12) / (24 − HCO3). ■ ■

If the delta ratio is > 2, there is concurrent metabolic alkalosis. If the delta ratio is < 1, there is concurrent non-AG metabolic acidosis.

NEUROLOGY

Localization

Neurology is all about the ability to localize lesions. Use the neuroaxis to determine the location of a lesion (see Figure 13-1). Findings in the history and PE can help differentiate between central—upper motor neuron (UMN)—lesions and peripheral—lower motor neuron (LMN)—lesions (see Table 13-1).

Brain

S T R O K E

Occurs when poor blood supply to the brain leads to acute onset of neuro- logic dysfunction. Can be ischemic (most common) or hemorrhagic (see Table 13-2). Etiology of stroke can be classified into five categories:

■ Large vessel atherosclerosis: Embolus, thrombus. ■ Small vessel disease: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM, smoking. ■ Cardioembolic: Atrial fibrillation (AF), endocarditis, recent myocardial

infarction (MI), prosthetic valve.

■ Cryptogenic: Unknown (but thought to be due to undiagnosed AF in many patients).

Diagnosis ■ The vascular territories affected can be seen on imaging (see CT scans in

Table 13-2).

■ Further workup to evaluate etiology of stroke:

■ MRI brain to look for stroke distribution and pattern. ■ CTA to look for vessel abnormalities (eg, occlusion) or stenosis. ■ TTE to look for shunt, clot, or valvular AF. ■ Telemetry to look for AF.

If there is evidence of large vessel occlusion on CTA and symptom onset was < 24 hours ago, then patient is a candidate for endovascular thrombectomy.

■ First line for hemorrhagic stroke:

LEFT MCA stroke leads to LANGUAGE deficits.

a.

The right middle cerebral artery (MCA). This is supported by neglect (a cortical sign) and sparing of the left leg, indicating preservation of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory. The MCA supplies the lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex; the ACA supplies the territory for motor control of the leg.

■ Control BP (typically SBP below 140–160). ■ ■ ■

Insert external ventricular drain to alleviate pressure. If evidence of aneurysm, consider coiling or clipping. If evidence of midline shift, neurologic decline, or impending hernia- tion, consult neurosurgery for decompressive craniectomy.

2° PrEvEntion ■ Aspirin daily. ■ Atorvastatin daily. ■ Smoking cessation. ■ BP control. ■ Anticoagulation if patient has AF. ■ Carotid endarterectomy recommended for patients with symptomatic ste- nosis 70–99% and should be strongly considered in patients with symp- tomatic stenosis > 50% or asymptomatic stenosis 60–99%.

Can be 1° or 2° to an underlying disorder. It is important to differentiate between the two because the underlying cause of a 2° headache is often a neurologic emergency. Table 13-5 summarizes the most common 1° head- ache syndromes. Table 13-6 lists 2° causes of headache other than traumatic brain injury (TBI) or brain bleeds such as subdural hematoma or SAH.

KEY FACT

Diagnosis Obtain imaging if you suspect headache is 2° to another underlying disorder:

Horner syndrome presents with ipsilateral miosis (pupillary constriction), ipsilateral ptosis (eyelid droop), and ipsilateral anhidrosis (lack of sweating) of the face.

■ A headache that is acute and extremely severe (“thunderclap headache”) → think SAH.

■ New onset headache in an adult with no headache history. ■ Focal neurologic signs or other neurologic sequelae (seizures). ■ Papilledema → think ↑ intracranial pressure (ICP). ■ A headache in an immunocompromised patient (eg, HIV).

For the pregnant woman with epilepsy, recommend that she stay on her antiepileptic therapy. If she is taking valproate, the most teratogenic antiepileptic, switching to another drug (eg, levetiracetam) is recommended before pregnancy. Taking 4 mg of folic acid daily is also recommended, as are regular checks of serum drug levels.

History/PE ■ Neurological exam is typically NORMAL interictally. ■ Pre-ictal: Patient may experience an aura. ■ Ictal period: May see rhythmic jerking of extremities or ↑ tone with gaze deviation toward the side of the seizure, bowel or bladder incontinence, and tongue biting.

■ Postictal: Patient may be confused, have slow reaction times, or be very sleepy.

Diagnosis ■ To rule out 2° causes of seizures, obtain CBC, BMP, magnesium, ammo-

nia, EtOH level, toxicology screen, antiepileptic drug (AED) level.

■ Obtain EEG to establish a baseline, localize the focus, and confirm epi- leptic vs nonepileptic seizures.

■ MRI of the brain is indicated in any new adult-onset seizure to look for a structural abnormality. If central nervous system (CNS) infection sus- pected and no evidence of ↑ ICP on imaging, obtain LP.

■ Seizures can be classified based on seizure focus and symptomology (see Table 13-7). Please note that the current classification system is in flux and will likely no longer be categorized based on “simple vs complex,” but you may still see seizures described this way on exam.

■ Status epilepticus is defined as continuous seizures for ≥ 5 minutes or dis- crete seizures with impaired consciousness in the interictal period. It is a medical emergency with up to a 20% mortality rate.

History/PE ■ Neurogenic claudication (pain relieved with bending over). Classic his-

tory: back pain improved when walking uphill.

■ Back pain and referred buttock pain. ■ ⊝ Straight leg raise sign.

Diagnosis ■ X-ray or MRI will show degenerative changes and stenosis of the spinal

canal.

Inflammatory disease of the spinal cord that can lead to motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction that localizes to a discrete spinal segment. ■ Can be idiopathic or secondary to an autoimmune or infectious process. ■ No evidence of compression on imaging.

History/PE ■ Weakness, numbness, and autonomic dysfunction below the level of the

lesion.

Diagnosis ■ MRI spine will show an enhancing region and there will be no sign of a

mass lesion.

■ Obtain CSF cell count, glucose, and protein to look for infectious source: herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Lyme.

■ Obtain CSF oligoclonal bands and MRI brain to look for evidence of MS.

Spinal cord lesions can arise from traumatic injury, vascular events, infectious or metabolic derangements. The key to identifying these lesions is an under- standing of the neuroanatomy, and the most commonly tested lesions are described in Table 13-11.

Anterior Horn Cells

A M Y O T R O P H I C L AT E R A L S C L E R O S I S

A progressive neurodegenerative motor neuron disease with pure motor symp- toms (sensations are intact).

History/PE ■ Progressive muscular weakness and wasting, spasticity, respiratory insuffi-

ciency, and possible dementia.

■ UMN signs: Spasticity, ⊕ Babinski sign. ■ LMN signs: Muscle atrophy, fasciculations. ■ Bulbar signs: Dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue fasciculations.

Diagnosis ■ EMG shows widespread denervation and re-enervation as well as

fasciculations.

■ Neuroimaging is normal and used to exclude other potential causes.

trEatmEnt ■ Mainly supportive, as ALS has no cure. ■ Riluzole, which inhibits glutamate release, and edaravone (infusion) can

potentially prolong survival in some patients.

Nerve Roots

R A D I C U L O PAT H I E S

Result from compression of the dorsal nerve root, most commonly from degenerative changes.

History/PE ■ Acute symptoms are typically caused by a herniated disk. ■ Gradual symptoms are typically caused by spondylosis and other degenera-

tive changes.

■ Patient may experience neck or back pain at the location of the lesion. ■ Spurling maneuver (extending and rotating neck to the side of pain and in cervical

applying pressure) reproduces radiculopathy. the patient’s symptoms

■ Straight-leg raise reproduces the patient’s symptoms in lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Diagnosis ■ EMG: Abnormalities in the muscles innervated by the affected root. ■ Nerve conduction study: Normal study since lesion is at the dorsal root

ganglion and sensation not affected.

■ MRI: Not diagnostic but may show degenerative changes.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: Conservative. NSAIDs, low-dose steroids, physical therapy. ■ Second line: If symptoms do not improve with 6–12 weeks of conservative

treatment, can consider surgery.

Peripheral Nerves
======================================
B E L L PA L S Y

Idiopathic cranial nerve VII palsy causing facial droop and difficulty with eye- lid closure.

History/PE ■ Acute onset of facial droop. ■ To distinguish Bell palsy from stroke or other central processes, look for involvement of the forehead (see Figure 13-5). There is no involvement of the forehead in central processes.

Diagnosis ■ Clinical diagnosis; etiology typically idiopathic. ■ Can obtain MRI to look for enhancement if concerned for infectious pro-

cess or stroke if concerned for central process.

■ Can obtain LP to look for Lyme, VZV, or HSV if there is history indicative of an infectious process.

Neuromuscular Junction
======================================
M Y A S T H E N I A G R A V I S

Autoimmune disorder that affects postsynaptic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Bimodal age distribution: early peak 30s–40s (women) and late peak 70s–90s (men).

History/PE ■ Ocular myasthenia: Ptosis and diplopia toward the end of the day. ■ Generalized myasthenia: Weakness of skeletal muscles throughout the

day.

■ Myasthenic crisis: Respiratory muscle fatigability leading to potential respi- ratory failure.

DiffErEntial Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (see Table 13-12), botulism, drug- induced myasthenia, motor neuron diseases (eg, ALS), generalized fatigue.

Diagnosis ■ Gold standard: Single-fiber EMG will show “jitter”—defined as an unsta- ble interval between the two action potentials of the same motor unit.

■ Repetitive nerve stimulation will show a decrement in the motor action potential with repeated stimulation.

■ Edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that prolongs the presence of ACh at the neuromuscular junction. A ⊕ test results in an immediate ↑ in the strength of affected muscles.

■ ACh receptor antibody ⊕ (if seronegative, test for muscle-specific kinase antibodies).

trEatmEnt ■ First line: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine). ■ Second line: Immunomodulating agents, steroids, steroid-sparing agents

(cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil).

■ Myasthenic crisis: Plasmapheresis and/or IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). ■ Thymectomy has been shown to be beneficial in reducing symptoms and

exacerbations.

Muscle

M U S C U L A R D Y S T R O P H Y

Group of hereditary progressive muscle-based diseases. The most common form is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is X-linked and caused by a defect in the gene encoding the dystrophin protein.

History/PE ■ Presents between ages 3 and 5; wheelchair bound in childhood; death due

to pulmonary complications in adolescence.

■ Presents with toe walking, waddling gait, and inability to run or climb stairs.

■ Gower Sign: Using arms to climb up the body when standing up. ■ Proximal and girdle muscle weakness and pseudohypertrophy of the

calves.

Diagnosis ■ Gold standard: Genetic testing for dystrophin gene mutation. ■ Muscle biopsy shows absence of dystrophin on immunohistochemistry. ■ Serum CK levels are ↑ to 20–100 times normal.

trEatmEnt First line: Prednisone can slow disease progression by up to 3 years.

Movement Disorders

PA R K I N S O N D I S E A S E

Neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of substantia nigra neurons leading to ↓ dopamine transmission in the basal ganglia. It typically presents in patients in their early 60s with slowed movements and resting tremor.

History/PE ■ Bradykinesia (slow movement) and akinesia (difficulty initiating movement). ■ Masked facies. ■ Cogwheel rigidity. ■ Resting pill-rolling tremor. ■ Monotone, hypophonic speech. ■ Slowing of thought processes—depression, cognitive impairment, and

psychosis.

Diagnosis ■ Clinical diagnosis only is based on the PE described above with 2/4 TRAP

features present (one must be bradykinesia).

■ Diagnosis is “confirmed” if patient’s symptoms respond to carbidopa- levodopa.

■ Can consider imaging to rule out other causes. ■ DAT scan may be helpful in distinguishing Parkinson disease from essen-

tial tremor.

9/27/18 3:35 PM

NEUROLOGY

trEatmEnt ■ First line: Carbidopa-levodopa. ■ Adjunctive therapy:

■ Dopamine agonists: Pramipexole, ropinirole, bromocriptine. ■ MAO inhibitors: Selegiline. ■ COMT inhibitors: Etacapone. ■ Anticholinergics: Benztropine (for tremor).

■ Can consider deep brain stimulation or pallidotomy for cases refractory to medication.
======================================
H U N T I N G T O N D I S E A S E

Autosomal dominant disorder leading to caudate and putamen atrophy. Young adult onset of gradual progressive involuntary movements, dementia, and psychosis.

History/PE ■ Choreiform (dancelike) movements. ■ Eye movement slowing. ■ Hyperreflexia with hypotonia leading to parkinsonism in advanced stages. ■ Cognitive decline, dementia, depression/anxiety/psychosis may be present.

Diagnosis ■

If there is a family history of Huntington disease, history and physical alone can make the diagnosis. In the absence of family history, gold standard is genetic testing for Hun- tington gene. ■ Genetic anticipation: Disease severity gets worse each generation due

■

to ↑ CAG repeats.

■ MRI may show caudate atrophy.

trEatmEnt Symptomatic; careful follow-up is necessary, as some treatments may worsen symptoms.

■ Chorea: Benzodiazepines, valproate, or dopamine-depleting agents such as tetrabenazine.

■ Parkinsonian features: Carbidopa/levodopa or dopamine agonists. ■ Depression: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. ■ Psychosis: Atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics preferred to mini-

mize extrapyramidal side effects.

Autoimmune Disorders

G U I L L A I N - B A R R É S Y N D R O M E

Acute ascending motor paralysis with areflexia and sensory deficits. Autoim- mune attack on myelin.

■ Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy:

History/PE ■ Ascending paralysis: Symmetrical muscular weakness seen first in the legs

and then in the arms.

■ ↓ or absent reflexes. ■ Paresthesias in the hands and feet. ■ Dysautonomia including orthostatic hypotension, tachy/bradycardia, uri-

nary retention, and ileus.

■ Facial palsies and bulbar weakness.

Diagnosis ■ Mainly clinical. ■ LP shows ↑ protein with normal WBC levels (“albuminocytologic

dissociation”).

■ EMG/NCS can show evidence of demyelination, typically 2 weeks from onset.

trEatmEnt ■ Self-limited condition; treatments are to help abate symptoms faster. ■ First line: IVIG or plasmapheresis; no benefit to using these together. ■ Supportive treatment: Monitor negative inspiratory force and functional vital capacity to assess for respiratory compromise requiring intubation.

■ Physical therapy and occupational therapy.

M U LT I P L E S C L E R O S I S

Autoimmune destruction of CNS myelin leading to weakness, numbness, and cognitive deficits. Young adult women in northern latitudes are at higher risk for developing MS. The four clinical courses of MS are relapsing-remitting, 2° progressive, 1° progressive, and progressive/relapsing.

History/PE ■ Depending on the location of the lesion, can have weakness, numbness,

diplopia, urinary incontinence, and cognitive deficits.

■ Lhermitte sign: Radiating/shooting pain up or down the spine on flexion or extension.

■ Optic neuritis: ↓ Visual acuity, pain with eye movements, central sco- toma, red desaturation.

■ Afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil): The pupil paradoxically dilates to a light stimulus as a result of delayed conduction.

■ Internuclear ophthalmoplegia: Lesion of the medial longitudinal fascicu- lus causes ipsilateral eye nystagmus with contralateral weakness in adduc- tion on lateral gaze away from the side of the lesion.

Diagnosis Gold standard McDonald criteria: Evidence on exam or imaging of at least two CNS lesions disseminated in time and space:

■ Brain MRI with gadolinium: Reveals multiple focal periventricular areas of ↑ signal, called Dawson fingers (see Figure 13-6).

■ CSF: Shows ↑ protein (myelin basic protein, oligoclonal bands). ■ Visual evoked potentials: Demonstrates delayed conduction.

Neuropsychiatric Disorders

D E M E N T I A

Progressive cognitive decline that interferes with the performance of the activ- ities of daily living. It differs from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in that MCI symptoms are less severe, presenting with memory loss and attention deficits that exceed those of normal aging but do not interfere with activities of daily living. Some commonly tested types of dementia are summarized in Table 13-13.

History/PE ■ ■ Subsequent manifestations include deficits in visuospatial ability (depth perception), language (speech or naming), calculation, or problem solv- ing; behavioral and personality changes; and depression.

Diagnosis ■ Always check for reversible causes first: ■ Thyroid-stimulating hormone. ■ Vitamin B12 and B6. ■ Urine drug screen and EtOH levels. ■ Infectious workup. ■ Depression screen.

■ Conduct a complete history and exam, a mini-mental status exam, and neuropsychological testing.

KEY FACT

Determination of Gravidity and Parity

Remember that twins account for 1 pregnancy, 1 delivery, but 2 live children.

Gravidity (G) refers to the total number of pregnancies a patient has had. Parity (P) refers to the outcome of these pregnancies and is expressed in the following order:

■ Full term = Number of deliveries ≥ 37 weeks. ■ Preterm = Number of deliveries between 20 and 36 6/7 weeks. ■ Aborted = Number of pregnancies ending before 20 weeks (includes

abortion, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancies).

To remember the order in which parity is presented, use Florida Power And Light.

■ Living = Number of current living children.

Hence, a woman who is a G3P2012 has had 3 total pregnancies, 2 full-term deliveries, 1 miscarriage or abortion, and 2 living children.

|_|

Prenatal Care and Nutrition

All prenatal visits should document weight, BP, extremity edema, urine pro- tein and glucose, fundal height (> 20 weeks), and fetal HR. Further recom- mendations are as follows:

■ Weight gain: Women with a normal prepregnancy body mass index should gain a total of 25–35 lbs during the pregnancy; obese women should gain less (11–20 lbs) and underweight women more (28–40 lbs). ■ Nutrition: Requirements ↑ for total calories, protein, iron, folate, calcium, and zinc. All patients should take prenatal vitamins and continue them while breastfeeding.

■ Caloric intake: An additional 300 kcal/day is needed during pregnancy and 500 kcal/day during breastfeeding.

■ Folate: Supplement with 400 μg/day at least 1 month prior to conception to ↓ the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Women with multiples, his- tory of a fetus with NTD, or who take antiepileptic medication should receive 4 mg/day.

■ Preventative care: Pap smear, purified protein derivative, and flu vaccine at first prenatal visit if needed. Give Tdap for all patients at 28 weeks. Defer other vaccinations until postpartum.

■ Smoking, alcohol, and drug cessation. ■ Screening for domestic violence (risk ↑ in pregnancy). ■ Prenatal labs: See Table 14-1 for a testing timeline.

Aneuploidy Screening and Diagnostic Testing
======================================
P R E N ATA L A N E U P L O I D Y S C R E E N I N G

Should be offered to all patients with careful discussion of possible results, test characteristics, and implications for management of the pregnancy.

■ Cell-free DNA, or NIPT (≥ 10 weeks): Tests fragments of fetal DNA in maternal blood, and can evaluate risk for aneuploidy, determine fetal gen- der, and identify an Rh ⊕ fetus if maternal blood is Rh ⊝.

■ First-trimester screen (10–14 weeks): U/S to measure nuchal translucency (fluid-filled subcutaneous space at the posterior fetal neck) combined with measurement of maternal serum β-hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A).

Tests of Fetal Well-Being

N O N S T R E S S T E S T

■ Baseline: Mean fetal HR (110–160 bpm is normal). ■ Variability: Beat-to-beat change in HR measured from peak to trough.

■ Absent (undetectable): Concerning for fetal acidemia. ■ Minimal (1–5 bpm): May indicate sleep cycle or drug effect, but con-

sider fetal acidemia if prolonged.

■ Moderate (6–25 bpm): Reassuring, indicates normal acid/base status and neurologic function.

■ Marked (≥ 26 bpm): Significance is unclear.

■ Acceleration: Rise in HR ≥ 15 bpm above baseline lasting ≥ 15 seconds

(after 32 weeks). ■ Reactive nonstress test (NST) includes two accelerations in a 20-minute

period (see Figure 14-1).

■ Nonreactive NST may be caused by fetal sleep cycle or maternal medications (ie, sedatives, narcotics), but warrants a biophysical pro- file or a contraction stress test (CST) to rule out uteroplacental insuffi- ciency (see below).

C O N T R A C T I O N S T R E S S T E S T

■ Used to identify uteroplacental dysfunction and predict how a baby will tolerate labor.

■ Fetal HR is monitored during spontaneous or induced (nipple stimula- tion or oxytocin) contractions with at least three contractions in 10 minutes.

■ A normal or “negative” CST has no late or significant variable decelera- tions and is highly predictive of fetal well-being.

■ An abnormal or “positive” CST is defined by late decelerations in con- junction with at least 50% of contractions.

■ Ultrasound is used to assess five parameters (see the mnemonic Test the Baby, MAN!).

■ A score of 2 (normal) or 0 (abnormal) is given to each of the parameters.

■ A score of 8–10 is reassuring for fetal well-being. ■ A score of ≤ 6) is worrisome for fetal compromise and should prompt

delivery or repeat testing depending on score and GA.

Normal Labor and Delivery

D E F I N I T I O N S

■ Labor: Defined by painful contractions with cervical change. ■ Term: Labor and delivery occur between 37 and 41 weeks + 6 days. Labor and/or delivery prior to this time is considered preterm, and after this time is postterm.

S TA G E S O F L A B O R

■ First stage: The time from the onset of labor to 10 cm of dilation.

■ Latent labor: Slow cervical change, lasting up to 20 hours for nullipa- rous women and 14 hours for multiparous women.

■ Active labor: Rapid cervical change (≥ 1cm/hr), beginning at 6 cm of dilation on average.

■ Cervical exams: Monitor the progression of labor and identify need for augmentation with oxytocin. Also perform prior to induction of labor to determine need for cervical ripening (ie, with prostaglandins). ■ Dilation: Diameter of internal cervical os (0–10 cm). ■ Effacement: Length of cervix from internal to external os (0–100%

effaced).

■ Station: Distance between the presenting part and maternal ischial spine (−5 cm to +5 cm).

■ Fetal heart tracing: Monitor status of fetus and identify need for resuscita-

tion or cesarean delivery. See Table 14-3 to review decelerations. ■ Category 1: Baseline 110–160 bpm, moderate variability, no decelera-

tions; reassuring, no action needed.

■ Category 3: Absent variability with recurrent late or variable decelera- tions, or fetal bradycardia (< 110 bpm); indicative of fetal distress, emergent cesarean delivery necessary.

■ Category 2: Any pattern not categorized above; resuscitation of the fetus with maternal repositioning, ↑ IV hydration, or administration of O2.

Teratogens in Pregnancy

■ Radiation: Ionizing radiation > 5000 mrads can cause fetal teratogenicity, so preferred imaging modalities during pregnancy are U/S and MRI, as these do not produce radiation. However, no single imaging study will subject the patient to > 5000 mrads, so x-ray and CT scan may be used if clinically indicated. As with all patients, the developing fetus should be exposed to as little radiation for as little time as possible, and the mother should be informed of teratogenic risks.

■ Medications: See Table 14-4 for safe and teratogenic medications during pregnancy.

■ FDA pregnancy risk categories are as follows:

■ Class A: Safety demonstrated in controlled human studies. ■ Class B: Considered safe; no ↑ risk in animal studies, but no adequate

studies in humans.

■ Class C: Use with caution; fetal adverse effects in animals but no ade- quate human studies, or no human or animal data are available.

■ Class D: Avoid if possible; associated with fetal risks based on human studies, but the benefits may outweigh the risks.

■ Class X: Teratogenic; risks outweigh benefits.

Abnormal Labor and Delivery

P R E M AT U R E R U P T U R E O F M E M B R A N E S

Defined as spontaneous rupture of membranes before the onset of labor. If this occurs at < 37 weeks, it is termed preterm premature rupture of mem- branes (PROM), or PPROM. Risk factors for PPROM include low socioeco- nomic status, young maternal age, smoking, illicit drug use, and infection (UTI, STDs).

History/PE ■ Patients may complain of feeling a “gush” or “trickle” of fluid.

OBSTETRICS

Diagnosis ■ Sterile speculum exam shows pooling of amniotic fluid in the vaginal

vault and/or fluid expressed from cervical os with Valsalva.

■ Nitrazine paper test: Paper turns blue in alkaline amniotic fluid. ■ Fern test: A ferning pattern is seen under the microscope after amniotic

fluid dries on glass slide.

trEatmEnt ■ ■ ■

If ≥ 37 weeks, induce labor. If 34–36 weeks and 6 days, induce labor after betamethasone is given. If 24–34 weeks, treat medically to prolong pregnancy and ↓ fetal risks. ■ Betamethasone: Two doses over 24 hours to improve fetal lung

maturity.

■ Magnesium sulfate: ↓ Risk of cerebral palsy if delivery likely at < 32 weeks, and for tocolysis to provide time for complete steroid course.

■ Ampicillin and erythromycin: To prolong pregnancy and ↓ infection rate.

■

In all PROM patients, suspicion for chorioamnionitis should be high. Treat with ampicillin and gentamicin and deliver regardless of GA if signs of infection are present—maternal fever, ↑ WBC, fetal tachycardia, puru- lent amniotic fluid.

P R E T E R M L A B O R

Labor (painful contractions with cervical change) between 20 and 37 weeks’ gestation.

History/PE ■ Patients may complain of menstrual-like cramps, uterine contractions, low

back pain, pelvic pressure, new vaginal discharge, or bleeding.

Diagnosis ■ Look for regular uterine contractions with concurrent cervical change. ■ Fetal fibronectin test may assist in diagnosis of preterm labor before 35 weeks. A ⊕ test indicates ↑ likelihood of preterm delivery but can also be caused by blood, recent intercourse, or recent cervical exam.

■ Obtain an ultrasound to verify GA, fetal presentation, and amniotic fluid index.
======================================
trEatmEnt ■ Begin with hydration. ■

If GA is < 37 weeks, administer steroids (to accelerate fetal lung maturity) and tocolytics (commonly nifedipine or magnesium) during steroid dose. Magnesium should be used for neuroprotection < 32 weeks. If GA is 34–36 weeks and 5 days, give steroids, but do not attempt tocolytic therapy. ■ Give penicillin or ampicillin for GBS prophylaxis if preterm delivery is

likely and GBS status is unknown or ⊕.

ComPliCations If preterm labor leads to preterm delivery, it can result in fetal respiratory dis- tress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, nec- rotizing enterocolitis, or fetal death.

Defined as any presentation other than cephalic (head down). Breech presenta- tion is the most common fetal malpresentation (affects 3% of all pregnancies).

Diagnosis ■ Perform Leopold maneuvers to identify fetal lie (see Figure 14-2).

■ Rock the thumb and index finger above the pubic symphysis to deter- mine if there is a bony head presenting (vs soft tissue).

■ Palpate the remainder of the uterus for feet and the position of the back.

■ Check with ultrasound if there is any doubt.

KEY FACT

When preparing for external cephalic version, always give Rho(D) immune globulin if patient is Rh ⊝.

trEatmEnt ■ Follow: Up to 75% of cases spontaneously change to cephalic presentation

by 38 weeks.

■ External cephalic version can be attempted at 37 weeks in the setting of

persistent malpresentation. ■ Apply pressure to the maternal abdomen to turn the infant. ■ Risks are placental abruption, cord compression and fetal distress; the infant must be monitored during and after the procedure, and consent must be obtained for emergent cesarean delivery.

Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy ■ The most common cause is autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Sequelae include ↑ rate of spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, hyper- tensive disorders, and placental abruption.

HELLP syndrome:

Hemolysis (↑ LDH, uric acid; ↓ hemoglobin, hematocrit) Elevated Liver enzymes (AST/ALT) Low Platelets (< 100)

■ Tx: Levothyroxine. Consider treating women with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism Transient condition that can occur in the first trimester when serum thyroid- stimulating hormone falls below the lower limit of normal and serum T3 and T4 levels are within their reference range.

Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy ■ Most commonly caused by Graves disease. ■ Sequelae include spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and intrauterine fetal demise. In the fetus, it can cause fetal tachycardia, fetal goiter, and advanced bone age. Thyroid storm can be precipitated by labor, infection, or preeclampsia.

■ Refractory vomiting that leads to weight loss, poor weight gain, dehydra- tion, ketosis from starvation, and metabolic alkalosis. Symptoms peak at 9 weeks but typically improve by 20 weeks.

■ Risk factors include nulliparity, multiple gestation, and trophoblastic disease.

■ DDx: Rule out molar pregnancy, hepatitis, gallbladder disease, reflux, and gastroenteritis.

■ Dx: Patient reports inability to tolerate PO despite medication. Labs show hyponatremia and a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Ketonuria suggests starvation ketosis.

■ Tx: If there is evidence of weight loss, dehydration, or altered electrolytes, hospitalize and give vitamin B6, metoclopramide or ondansetron, IV hydration, and electrolyte replacement. Advance diet slowly and avoid fatty foods.

■ Definitions:

■ “Postpartum blues”: Mild depressive symptoms that develop within a few days of delivery and resolve within 2 weeks.

■ Postpartum depression: Major depressive disorder occurring within 12 months of giving birth.

2

■ Postpartum psychosis: Psychotic symptoms that develop within 2 weeks of giving birth.

■ Tx: Patients with “postpartum blues” should be reassured and offered close follow-up. Patients with depression or psychosis should be screened for sui- cidal or homicidal ideations and referred to a psychiatrist. First-line treat- ment for postpartum depression is an SSRI. If patients have a history of depression and were previously managed successfully on another medica- tion, that medication should be restarted.

The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony. This patient’s risk factor was having a baby large for GA, which caused uterine over-distention and inability to contract well post-delivery.

■ Spontaneous abortion: Loss of a pregnancy prior to 20 weeks’ gestation, also called miscarriage. Occurs in 10–15% of recognized pregnancies. Risk factors include advanced maternal age, prior SAB, diabetes, antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombophilia, and structural uterine or cervical abnormalities. Symptoms include bleeding and cramping.

When fetal Rh ⊕ RBCs leak into Rh ⊝ maternal circulation, maternal anti- Rh IgG antibodies can form. These antibodies can cross the placenta and react with fetal Rh ⊕ RBCs, leading to fetal hemolysis (erythroblastosis fetalis) and hydrops fetalis.

■ Prevention: Give Rho(D) immune globulin to Rh ⊝ women:

If there is concern for SAB, ectopic, abruption, or other opportunity for fetal-maternal hemorrhage including invasive prenatal testing or trauma.

■ Routinely at 28 weeks. ■ After delivery, if the baby is Rh ⊕; the Kleihauer-Betke fetal-maternal hemorrhage test can be used to quantify the number of fetal RBCs mixed with maternal blood and determine the amount of Rho(D) immune globulin needed.

■ Management:

■ Sensitized Rh ⊝ women with titers > 1:16 should be closely moni- tored for evidence of fetal hemolysis with serial ultrasound and middle cerebral artery Doppler velocimetry. In severe cases, intrauterine blood transfusion via the umbilical vein or preterm delivery is indicated.

May be benign or pathologic.

For third-trimester bleeding … With pain → abruption or uterine rupture. Without pain → placenta previa.

■ Benign causes include bleeding from ectropion. Most commonly, bleed- ing in the third trimester results from cervical change once labor starts as well as from bloody show (a small amount of bloody mucous).

GYNECOLOGY

Review of the Menstrual Cycle

■ A normal menstrual cycle is 28 ± 7 days in length with bleeding lasting

for 3–7 days. ■ The first day of bleeding = day 1 of the cycle. ■ Ovulation typically occurs at day 10–14 (variable depending on length

of the follicular phase).

■ Menstrual cycles are most irregular in the years immediately following menarche and preceding menopause.

■ Menopause is characterized by rises in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

■ Table 15-1 and Figure 15-1 offer an overview of the physiologic changes involved in the menstrual cycle.

Abnormal Uterine Bleeding

Characterized by abnormalities in the frequency, duration, volume, and/or timing of menstrual bleeding. A useful mnemonic for categorizing its causes is PALM-COEIN (see Table 15-2).

History/PE ■ Take a thorough menstrual history to determine the onset, quantity, and

timing of abnormal bleeding.

■ Perform a speculum exam to assess for any vaginal or cervical lesions (eg, cervical polyps). Conduct a bimanual exam to assess the size, shape, and contour of the uterus and ovaries.

Diagnosis ■

Initial lab work includes beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) (always rule out pregnancy!), CBC, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin.

■ Conduct pelvic ultrasound to look for structural causes.

T A B L E 1 5 - 1 . Overview of the Normal Menstrual Cycle

OrcaN

Organ

Phase

Ovary Follicular phase: Release of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland stimulates the ovary and results in preantral follicular recruitment within the ovary and eventu- ally development of a dominant follicle for ovulation

Luteal phase: About 32 hours after the start of the LH surge, ovulation occurs, which releases the ovum (egg) and results in formation of the corpus luteum from the residual follicle

Uterus Proliferative phase: Estradiol, produced by the ovarian follicles, induces growth and proliferation of the endometrium

Secretory phase: After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes predominantly progesterone and lower levels of a less potent estrogen, estrone, to maintain the endometrium for implantation. If implantation does not occur, the corpus luteum undergoes involution, which causes an abrupt drop in progesterone and estrogen levels, resulting in shedding of the endometrium (menstruation)

■ Other testing includes:

In adolescents: complete metabolic panel (CMP) to evaluate for renal or hepatic causes of coagulopathy, coagulation studies, and von Wille- brand studies.

■ Saline infusion sonohysterography to look for uterine polyps if initial ultrasound suggests intracavitary mass.

■ Endometrial biopsy for women ≥ 45 years of age or younger women with risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia/malignancy (ie, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome [PCOS]).

■

■ Hysteroscopy for direct visualization of the endometrial cavity. In older women, consider FSH/LH. An ↑ in both FSH and LH is sugges- tive of menopause, as the ovaries can no longer respond to hormonal sig- nals by producing estrogen and progesterone.

trEatmEnt ■ Treat the underlying cause. ■ First-line approaches to managing heavy or irregular menses: NSAIDs, combined contraceptives (pills, patch, vaginal ring), medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, progestin-secreting intrauterine devices (IUDs), and oral tranexamic acid.

■ Uterine artery embolization and endometrial ablation can be considered as less invasive surgical management options in patients who have com- pleted childbearing.

■ Ultimate management is hysterectomy if medical management is declined, contraindicated, or fails.

■ Acute, profuse bleeding can be treated with high-dose oral progesterone, high-dose combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), high-dose IV estro- gen, dilation and curettage (D&C), uterine artery embolization, uterine

Defined as either 1° or 2° amenorrhea.

Always rule out pregnancy in a patient with amenorrhea.

■ 1° amenorrhea: Absence of menses by age 15 or absence of menses within 5 years of breast development. Differential diagnoses include the following (see Figure 15-2): ■ Pregnancy. ■ Gonadal failure (eg, Turner syndrome, sex chromosome mosaicism). ■ Hypothalamic failure (eg, gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] deficiency, Kallmann syndrome, central nervous system neoplasm). ■ Pituitary failure (eg, prepubertal hypothyroidism, early mumps infection). ■ Androgen resistance (46XY), congenital adrenal hyperplasia disorders. ■ Anatomic anomaly (eg, congenital absence of the uterus or transverse

vaginal septum).

■ 2° amenorrhea: Absence of menses for three cycles (if previously regular) or for 6 months (if previously irregular). Differential diagnoses include preg- nancy, hypothyroidism, hyperandrogenism (eg, PCOS), hyperprolactinemia, anorexia nervosa, stress, strenuous exercise, uterine outflow defect (intrauter- ine adhesions), and premature ovarian insufficiency (see Figure 15-3).

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome

The most commonly diagnosed cause of hyperandrogenism in women. PCOS often affects adolescent women. The pathogenesis is complex.

History/PE ■ Patients often present with a history of infrequent or irregular menstrual bleeding, unwanted hair growth, acne, evidence of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans) and/or weight gain.

A 23-year-old woman with a history of irregular menses has been unable to conceive for 2 years. Her partner’s infertility workup has been ⊝.

vated free or total testosterone). ■ Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.

■ Women with PCOS have an ↑ risk of diabetes and cardiac disease. Once PCOS has been diagnosed, order a glucose tolerance test and a lipid panel.

■ An ↑ LH/FSH ratio (> 2) is also characteristic.
======================================
trEatmEnt Treat the specific symptoms:

■ Hyperglycemia/diabetes: Weight loss; hypoglycemic agents like metformin. ■ Infertility: Symptoms may also improve with diet and exercise. Induce

ovulation with clomiphene and/or metformin.

■ Hirsutism: Start combination OCPs to suppress ovarian steroidogenesis and protect the uterine lining from unopposed estrogen secretion. Spi- ronolactone may also be used.

Endometriosis

Growth of endometrial tissue in locations other than the uterus. The most common location is the ovaries (called endometriomas or “chocolate cysts”), cul-de-sac, and uterosacral ligament. It is associated with premenstrual pelvic pain due to stimulation of endometrial tissue from estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle.

History/PE ■ May present with cyclic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and

infertility.

■ On pelvic exam, patients may have tender nodularity along the uterosacral ligament +/− a fixed, retroflexed uterus or enlarged ovaries.

Diagnosis The history and physical can suggest the diagnosis, but the gold standard is direct visualization during laparoscopy with biopsy showing endometrial glands.

trEatmEnt ■ Depends on the patient’s symptoms, age, desire for future fertility, and dis- ease stage. The extent of pelvic disease does not correlate with the patient’s symptoms. If a patient has a confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis and tubal occlusion causing infertility, she should be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist. Management options include operative laparoscopy or in vitro fertilization. If the patient’s main complaint is pain, the objective is to induce a state of anovulation. ■ For mild pain, first-line treatment is NSAIDs and/or continuous OCPs. ■ For moderate to severe pain, options include medical treatment to

■

induce anovulation (GnRH agonists).

9/25/18 3:07 PM

GYNECOLOGY

If medical management fails, consider operative laparoscopy to excise endometrial implants.

■ Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is used as a final ther- apeutic option.
======================================
Gestational Trophoblastic Disease

Includes hydatidiform moles, which may be complete or partial (see Table 15-3), and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Hydatidiform mole accounts for approximately 80% of cases of gestational trophoblastic disease.

History/PE ■ Patient may present with first-trimester uterine bleeding and excessive nau-

sea and vomiting.

■ Pelvic exam might show bleeding from the cervical os and uterine size greater than dates.

■ Rarely, it can be associated with preeclampsia or eclampsia at < 20 weeks or thyroid storm.

Diagnosis ■ CBC, type and screen, CMP. ■ Markedly elevated serum β-hCG. ■ A “snowstorm” appearance of grapelike molar clusters on pelvic ultra-

sound (see Figure 15-4) with or without presence of a fetus.

■ Obtain a CXR to rule out metastases.

trEatmEnt ■ D&C with preoperative preparation for hemorrhage with two large-bore

IVs, crossmatch for blood, and uterotonic medications available.

■ Postsurgical management:

■ Carefully follow serum β-hCG levels after D&C for possible develop- ment of GTN. Check weekly until β-hCG is ⊝ and then monthly for 6 months.

■ Contraceptive plan is essential during time of serum β-hCG monitoring.

■ Subsequent development of GTN is treated with chemotherapy or hysterectomy.

Vulvovaginitis

Vulvovaginitis

Most commonly caused by bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella vaginalis), fungal infection (Candida albicans), or protozoal infection (Trichomonas vaginalis). It can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonor- rhea or chlamydia (see Table 15-4).

History/PE ■ May present with ↑ vaginal discharge, a change in discharge odor, vulvo-

vaginal pruritus, and/or vaginal spotting.

■ Perform a complete exam of the vulva, vagina, and cervix. Look for vulvar edema, erythema, and discharge.

Diagnosis/trEatmEnt Obtain swabs from the vagina to perform a wet mount and cultures for gonor- rhea and chlamydia.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

An infection of the upper genital tract that may involve uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or ovaries with or without peritonitis. Risk factors include age < 25, multiple sexual partners, lack of condom/barrier use, and a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or STIs. PID is usually a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic organisms from the lower genital tract. Patients infected with gonorrhea or chlamydia are at ↑ risk of develop- ing PID.

History/PE Patients often present with abdominal pain, vaginal discharge +/− fevers and malaise. Exam findings may include tachycardia, fever, diffuse abdomi- nal tenderness, and cervical motion tenderness (“chandelier sign”) on pel- vic exam.

Ectopic Pregnancy

Defined as any pregnancy that is implanted outside the uterine cavity. The most common location is the fallopian tube (95%). Risk factors include a his- tory of prior ectopic pregnancy, PID, tubal/pelvic surgery, and diethylstilbes- trol exposure in utero.

History/PE ■ Patient may report amenorrhea, lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,

and/or abnormal vaginal bleeding.

■ Patient may have abdominal tenderness to palpation, adnexal mass, or fullness.

■ A ruptured ectopic may present with unstable vital signs, diffuse abdomi- nal pain, rebound tenderness, guarding, and shock.

DiffErEntial Spontaneous abortion, molar pregnancy, ruptured or hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst, PID, ovarian torsion, appendicitis, pyelonephritis, diverticulitis, regional ileitis, ulcerative colitis.

Diagnosis ■ Highly suspect ectopic in a patient with low abdominal/pelvic pain, ⊕ urine or serum β-hCG, and no intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound.

Two types of IUDs are approved for use in the United States. Both are highly effective, with > 99% efficacy.

Obtain quantitative β-hCG and transvaginal ultrasound. If the patient is hemodynamically stable with a hCG level is less than 3000 and no intrauterine pregnancy and no adnexal masses, the patient is diagnosed with a pregnancy of unknown location. Repeat the patient’s β-hCG in 48 hours. If the value does not double in 48 hours, suspect ectopic pregnancy. It is also important to consider nongynecologic causes.

■ Levonorgestrel IUD: A progesterone-only IUD that causes thickening of the cervical mucus, thinning of the endometrium, and decreased peristal- sis of fallopian tubes. ■ Lasts 5 years. ■ ↓ Menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea; thus, a good choice for the

treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding.

■ Side effects: Perforation with placement, irregular menstrual bleeding (30–70% of women experience amenorrhea), pelvic cramping, vaginal discharge.

■ Should be taken immediately after unprotected intercourse; can be taken up to 5 days afterward, but with decreasing effectiveness.

■ Options include oral levonorgestrel (Plan B) (most effective when used within 3 days but can be used up to 5 days after), oral ulipristal acetate (within 5 days), or placement of a copper IUD (5 days). ■ The most effective emergency contraception is copper IUD.

|_| Infertility

Infertility

Defined as inability of a couple to conceive after 1 year of unprotected inter- course (or 6 months if > 35 years of age). It affects 10–15% of couples. Causes are listed in Table 15-6.

Diagnosis ■ Semen analysis to rule out male factors. ■ Assessment of ovulation status with home ovulation predictor kits or mea- surement of basal body temp, serum testing of androgens, FSH, LH, TSH, prolactin to rule out endocrine dysfunction.

■ PE, pelvic ultrasound, and hysterosalpingography to rule out uterine ana- tomical abnormalities and assess tubal patency.

trEatmEnt ■ Treat the underlying cause. ■ Fertility rates in endometriosis can be improved through use of operative laparoscopy to lyse scar tissue and endometriomas causing tubal occlusion. ■ Ovulation can be induced with clomiphene or letrozole. Caution should be exercised with these medications, as they can lead to ovarian hyper- stimulation and multiple gestations.

GYNECOLOGY

■ For refractory cases, assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fer- tilization can be used.

Menopause

Cessation of menstruation for 12 consecutive months. Average age of onset is 51. Surgical menopause occurs following removal or irradiation of the ovaries. Postmenopausal women are at ↑ risk for developing osteoporosis and heart disease.

History/PE ■ Patients may complain of menstrual irregularities, hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, mood changes, ↓ libido, and vaginal dryness. ■ Exam may reveal vaginal dryness, ↓ breast size, and genital tract atrophy.

Diagnosis ■ Requires 1 year without menses with no other known cause. ■ ↑↑ Serum FSH (> 30 IU/L) is suggestive.

trEatmEnt ■ Hormone therapy with estrogen or combined estrogen and progesterone can be used for short-term symptomatic relief of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats).

■ Absolute contraindications to hormone therapy include undiagnosed vagi- nal bleeding, active liver disease, recent myocardial infarction, recent or active vascular thrombosis, and a history of endometrial or breast cancer. ■ Symptoms may be treated with alternatives to hormone therapy:

■ Vasomotor instability: Venlafaxine and some selective serotonin reup- take inhibitors, clonidine.

■ Vaginal atrophy: Vaginal lubricants or topical estrogens. ■ Osteoporosis: Calcium, vitamin D, calcitonin, bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate), selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, raloxifene), denosumab.

■ ↓ Libido: Flibanserin (“female Viagra”).

■ Unopposed estrogen (without progesterone therapy) can lead to endome- trial hyperplasia and/or carcinoma.

Urinary Incontinence

Involuntary loss of urine that negatively affects a patient’s psychological, phys- ical, and social well-being. See Table 15-7 for an outline of stress, urge, and mixed incontinence.

History/PE/Diagnosis ■ Voiding diaries can help quantify the frequency and volume of urine lost, the circumstances of leakage (to diagnose type of incontinence), voiding patterns, and the amount and type of fluid taken in. If history and exam findings do not clearly demonstrate simple stress uri- nary incontinence, patients should have a screening neurologic exam to rule out neurologic causes as well as urologic evaluation.

■ A standing cough stress test can be used to diagnose stress incontinence; urodynamics/cystometry can be used to diagnose urge incontinence.

KEY FACT

trEatmEnt Table 15-7 outlines treatment measures for urinary incontinence.

Urinary tract infection must be ruled out in all women complaining of urinary incontinence.

Benign Breast Disorders

Include fibrocystic change (the most common), fibroadenoma, intraductal papilloma (a common cause of bloody nipple discharge), duct ectasia, fat necrosis, mastitis, and breast abscess. See Table 15-8 for a list of common examples.

■ Nipple discharge: Most commonly seen in women 20–40 years of age.

■ Should raise concern if bloody, brown, black, unilateral, or persistent; appears spontaneously without manipulation; or is associated with sys- temic signs.

■ Unilateral discharge is most commonly from intraductal papilloma, which is rare and benign. Discharge is sticky and clear to straw-colored.

■ Breast lump:

■ Evaluation includes assessing the general appearance of the breast (inverted nipple, change in size or symmetry) or any skin changes.

Mammography should be performed for any new breast mass in an older woman even if the patient had a recent ⊝ study.

■ Determine if related to menses or if it was spontaneously discovered and has not gone away.

■ Exam should include evaluation of the lymph nodes. ■ For young women, it is reasonable to start with a breast ultrasound before mammography. For older women, start with mammography.

Well-Child Care/Routine Health Screening

S C R E E N I N G B A S I C S

Routine health screening includes (1) monitoring of growth and develop- ment; (2) prevention of illness and promotion of safety; and (3) anticipatory guidance. Key features of routine screening include the following:

■ Metabolic/genetic diseases: Newborns are typically screened within the first days of life before leaving the hospital following birth. The exact con- tent of the screen varies by state but includes diseases that can be treated to ↓ morbidity and mortality (eg, thyroid disease, cystic fibrosis [CF], phe- nylketonuria, galactosemia, and tyrosinemia).

■ Growth parameters/development/behavior: Screen or monitor at each visit to ensure age-appropriate milestones are being met and growth curves are being followed; otherwise, can start early interventions.

■ Lead/anemia: Start screening during the developmental period in which children begin to explore their environment via hand-to-mouth interac- tions (ie, 9–15 months). Repeat at age 2 years, especially in high-risk com- munities (eg, those with houses built before 1950). ■ Screening blood lead levels > 15 mcg/dL need to be reported to the

Health Department.

■ Chelation with dimercaptosuccinic acid, succimer begins at blood lead level > 45 mcg/dL.

■ BMI: Track starting at 2 years of age. ■ BP: Screen with every medical exam starting at age 3. Norms are based on

sex, age, and height percentile.

■ Vision and hearing: Objective hearing at birth; objective hearing and vision annually starting at age 3. Subjective visual testing can be done with developmental monitoring in between (eg, visual tracking of eyes to objects or people).
======================================
N U T R I T I O N

■ Breastfeeding:

■ Encouraged as an exclusive feeding source until 6 months of age. ■ Benefits: Confers immunogenic factors (including IgA, T-cells, and antibodies) that ↓ the risk of allergies, necrotizing enterocolitis, and infections of the respiratory and GI tract. Also improves bonding between mother and infant.

■ Formula:

■ All formulas are mixed to 20 kcal/oz unless concentrated to optimize growth.

■ Milk protein intolerance can be IgE mediated with anaphylaxis or non–IgE mediated; presentations include vomiting, diarrhea, constipa- to tion, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and bloody stools 2° proctocolitis.

N O R M A L G R O W T H PAT T E R N S

■ Newborns: Expected to lose up to 10% of their birth weight in their first several days of life and to regain their birth weight by 2 weeks.

■ Term infants and children: Typically follow the growth curves they begin on without deviation > 2 percentile curves in either direction.

9/27/18 4:30 PM

PEDIATRICS

■ Premature infants: Have a separate growth curve, and they may exhibit jumping up several curves when they are “catching up” their growth to match what they would have been if they had been born term. However, if all three parameters are not changing somewhat consistently with one another, this may be cause for investigation.

A B N O R M A L G R O W T H PAT T E R N S

Failure to Thrive Indicates persistent failure to follow upward trend of a growth curve (weight or length). Often seen when a growth curve of an infant becomes a horizontal or near-horizontal line and transverses several percentile curves. However, some of these patients should be matched to their family members (ie, if an infant is born at the 90th percentile, but both parents are small and short, the patient may be re-equilibrating to true familial genetic stature). Failure to thrive (FTT) has a multitude of causes, including:

■

■

Inadequate Intake: Overdilution of formula, infrequent feeding, mechani- cal problems. Inadequate absorption or ↑ losses: Malabsorption, infectious diarrhea, bili- ary atresia, intestinal obstruction, necrotizing enterocolitis, short gut.

■ ↑ Metabolic demand or ineffective utilization: Inborn errors of metabo- lism, CF, HIV, endocrine disorders, congenital heart disease (CHD).

History/PE A good history may reveal diagnosis.

■ Nutrition history with possible need for observed feeding of the child. This is especially true for breastfed infants who should have the mother-baby dyad observed feeding by a lactation specialist.

■ Elimination history along with quality and frequency of stools. ■ Systemic symptoms (such as ↑ work of breathing, cough, vomiting, etc.). ■ Family and social history.

Diagnosis If history and physical are not revealing, consider basic lab workup (CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, lead level, and UA).

T A B L E 1 6 - 1 . Developmental Milestones
======================================
aFor premature infants < 2 years of age, chronologic age must be adjusted for gestational age. For example, an infant born at 7 months’ gestation (2 months early) would be expected to perform at the 4-month level at the chronologic age of 6 months. However, vaccines should be administered based on chronologic age despite prematurity.

Mild acute illness is not a contraindication or an indication for delay in vaccination regardless of use of concurrent antimicrobials.

Figure 16-1 summarizes the recommended timetable for childhood immuni- zations. Schedules may vary for children who are behind and require catch- up immunizations. Key considerations before immunization include the following:

■ Severe allergic reaction (such as anaphylaxis) to a vaccine or its compo- nents: A contraindication to that vaccination. Other allergic reactions (even those to egg) are considered precautions, and vaccines may be administered in a controlled setting depending on the reaction.

■ Live virus vaccines (eg, varicella; measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]; combi- nation vaccines; intranasal influenza): Contraindicated in patients who are immunocompromised, immunosuppressed, or pregnant. Parents should be counseled to monitor for signs of rash in vaccinated family members. If rash

■ Moderate or severe acute illness: A delay in vaccination can be considered.

■ Parental refusal of vaccination: Try to discover why the parent is refusing and create an open dialogue with them. Alternative and customized vacci- nation schedules are better than no vaccinations. Vaccines do not cause autism.

Immunocompromised, immunosuppressed, and pregnant patients should not be given live virus vaccines (eg, intranasal influenza, varicella, and MMR-containing vaccines).

Workup must consider physical, sexual, and emotional abuse/neglect. Diag- nosis is based on a history that is discordant with physical findings or develop- mental history.

5

KEY FACT

History/PE Presentation may include:

Consider nonaccidental trauma whenever the history of an injury is discordant with physical findings and/ or developmental history.

■ Multiple injuries in varying stages of healing. ■ Skeletal trauma in the absence of a developmentally plausible mecha- nism; indicators also include spiral fracture of long bones, multiple/old/ posterior rib fractures, or metaphyseal fractures (also known as corner or bucket-handle fractures).

■ Pattern injuries (eg, cigarette/immersion burns). ■ Oddly situated bruises (not over bony prominences) or bruises on a child

who is not yet mobile.

■ Retinal hemorrhage in infants. ■ ■ Growth failure. ■ Signs/symptoms of sexually transmitted infection (STIs) or genital trauma

in prepubertal children.

Diagnosis ■ Labs: Evaluate for underlying disorders that would result in an acute pre- sentation (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta, bleeding diathesis, acute infection). ■ Bone metabolism: Calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase. ■ Metabolic disorders: Liver function tests (LFTs), electrolytes. ■ Coagulopathy: CBC, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time,

INR.

■ Infection: CBC, UA. ■ General: Consider toxicology and STI evaluation.

■ Imaging: Skeletal survey to evaluate for fractures in various stages of heal- ing; head CT for intracranial bleeding. If concern for abdominal trauma, consider abdominal CT, LFTs, amylase, lipase, and check urine and stool for gross blood.

■ Consultation: Consider an ophthalmology evaluation and consultation with a child abuse team.

trEatmEnt ■ Physicians are mandated reporters of any suspected abuse or nonacciden- tal trauma and should immediately notify social services or Child Protec- tive Services. Parents need to be notified when abuse is suspected and a report is made.

■ Consider hospitalization to ensure the safety of the child if there is no other safe discharge plan. Be cognizant of other children in the home and their safety in the evaluation. Physicians can get an emergency court order in the event of a parent declining hospitalization.

The vast majority of skin findings in the neonatal period are benign. Nonethe- less, they are often a cause for concern among new parents. Table 16-2 describes common neonatal rashes.

R E S P I R AT O R Y D I S T R E S S

■ Common causes of neonatal respiratory distress and their treatments are

outlined in Table 16-3. ■ Other causes include:

■ Sepsis (see Neonatal Sepsis). ■ CHD is important to consider if O2 saturation fails to improve with supplemental O2. (Refer to the Cardiology chapter for further details.) ■ Anatomic airway anomalies (eg, choanal atresia, in which an NG tube

cannot be passed through the nares at birth).

■ Pneumothorax (especially in an infant who suddenly decompensates) and pneumonia.

■ Neurologic abnormalities.

N E O N ATA L S E P S I S

Serious bacterial infections are rare in the pediatric population but are rela- tively more common in young infants by virtue of their immature immune systems and waning maternal antibody protection. Risk factors in the immedi- ate perinatal period include maternal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection or STI, rupture of membranes lasting > 18 hours, maternal fever, chorioam- nionitis, premature labor, and limited or no maternal prenatal care.

■ Most common pathogens:

■ Bacterial: E coli; GBS and other gram ⊝ rods. Listeria monocytogenes is rare but is frequently tested on pediatric exams.

■ Viral: Mothers with active herpes lesions at the time of delivery or a first-time diagnosis of HSV in the peripartum period carry an ↑ risk of transmitting HSV to the infant. HSV should also be considered in any ill-appearing infant < 28 days of age.

History/PE Septic infants often present with fever or hypothermia and nonspecific signs such as poor feeding, irritability, rapid breathing, vomiting, or ↓ activity.

Diagnosis ■ All evaluations should include a CBC, a blood culture, a UA and urine culture, and an LP for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts, glucose, pro- tein, and culture.

■ Workup for HSV should include HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from CSF/skin and LFTs for infants who appear toxic. Workup is also indi- cated if there is suspicion for first-time HSV infection in a mother during pregnancy.

■ Consider a CXR if a patient exhibits hypoxemia, respiratory distress, or clinical findings that raise concern for pneumonia.

■ Pneumonia is the most common source of sepsis immediately after birth. Then the chances of meningitis and bacteremia increase after the first 24 hours.

Three-month-old infants rarely roll, and a fall from a couch should not cause a broken femur. Therefore, a full workup should be conducted for medical causes of unusual fractures (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta, nutritional deficiencies) as well as for injuries of abuse. Consider a skeletal survey, an ophthalmologic exam, and head imaging along with hematology labs, liver and pancreatic enzymes, bone labs, electrolytes, and a UA.

If the cause of sepsis is a urinary tract infection (UTI), a renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) may be obtained to evaluate the infant for hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux.

trEatmEnt ■ Initial treatment: IV ampicillin to cover Listeria plus either gentamicin or

a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime.

■ Avoid ceftriaxone in premature infants and infants < 28 days old because it displaces bilirubin from albumin and can cause sequelae of hyperbiliru- binemia (eg, kernicterus).

■ Consider acyclovir if there is a maternal history of HSV (especially if the mother had her first infection during pregnancy or active lesions at birth) or if the infant appears ill.

J A U N D I C E

Physiologic Jaundice Nearly all babies have some form of indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubine- mia, commonly known as physiologic jaundice. Causes include:

■ ↑ RBC breakdown. ■ ↓ Bilirubin breakdown due to ↓ conjugation in the immature liver and

lack of appropriate bacterial components in the intestines.

■ ↓ Excretion due to less frequent stooling and urination.

History/PE ■ Physiologic jaundice usually presents in the first 36–48 hours of life and

reaches peak total bilirubin levels of 10–15 mg/dL at 5–7 days of life.

■ Visible jaundice starts at the head (or eyes) and travels down the body as

bilirubin levels ↑. Initial evaluation should include both total and direct bilirubin to estab- lish whether the hyperbilirubinemia is direct or indirect.

■ Risk factors: Mother’s blood type O negative, birth trauma, Asian descent, preterm.

trEatmEnt ■ ↑ Feeding: Most normal babies will be able to excrete bilirubin on their own with time, additional intake, and improved intestinal motility from the gastrocolic reflex.

■ Phototherapy: Modifies the bilirubin molecule into a water-soluble form that can be more easily excreted as long as it is indirect hyperbilirubinemia.

■ Exchange transfusion is indicated for severe jaundice. ■ Serum bilirubin levels should be trended during treatment for

hyperbilirubinemia.

Breastfeeding Failure and Breast Milk Jaundice Breastfeeding failure jaundice: Occurs in exclusively breastfed newborns as a result of ineffective breastfeeding (poor latch, low maternal milk production).

■ Hx/PE: Typically presents in the first week of life with bilirubin levels greater than those seen with physiologic jaundice.

■ Dx: Made with a good history in the setting of an exclusively breastfed newborn. May help to look at degree of weight loss in the infant and to have a lactation specialist observe and evaluate quality of breastfeeding. ■ Tx: Assistance with improvement of breastfeeding. Preference is to pre- serve exclusive breastfeeding per mother’s desires but may need to supple- ment with formula if weight loss and jaundice continue. Phototherapy initiated if bilirubin reaches light levels on the phototherapy nomogram.

Breast milk jaundice: Delay in hepatic bilirubin conjugation that can pro- long jaundice in newborns.

■ Hx/PE: Presents after the first 3–5 days of life and peaks at 2 weeks of age. Total bilirubin levels may reach 19–20 mg/dL and may persist for 1–2 months.

■ Dx: A diagnosis of exclusion. ■ Tx: Rarely requires phototherapy. Breastfeeding should be encouraged, as

the problem will resolve without treatment.

CHAPTER 16

PEDIATRICS

Pathologic Jaundice Jaundice is considered pathologic if it is severe or prolonged, occurs within the first 24 hours of life, or is associated with ↑ direct (conjugated) biliru- bin. A direct bilirubin of > 10% or 2 mg/dL of the total suggests a hepato- biliary or general metabolic disorder. Very high levels of unconjugated bilirubin (> 30 mg/dL) can cross the blood-brain barrier and deposit in the basal ganglia, causing kernicterus, an irreversible, potentially fatal encephalopathy.

■ Causes of pathologic indirect hyperbilirubinemia include:

■ ↑ Bilirubin production: Hemolysis, sepsis, severe bruising/hematoma. ■ Bilirubin conjugation abnormalities: Hepatic enzyme deficiencies,

hepatic dysfunction.

■ Bilirubin excretion abnormalities: Intestinal obstruction, poor motility.

■ Causes of pathologic direct hyperbilirubinemia include:

5

KEY FACT

Remember that a direct bilirubin of > 10% or 2 mg/dL of total bilirubin points to a hepatobiliary or general metabolic disorder.

■ Intrahepatic: Biliary obstruction/atresia (most common), choledochal cysts, neonatal hepatitis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syn- drome, Alagille syndrome, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, total parental nutrition [TPN] cholestasis (affects premature infants on TPN). See also Table 16-6.

■ Extrahepatic: Sepsis, UTIs, hypothyroidism, CF, inborn errors of metabolism, RBC abnormalities such as sickle cell disease or heredi- tary spherocytosis.

5B

KEY FACT

History/PE ■ Look for hepatomegaly, acholic (pale to white) stools, signs of anemia or plethora, evidence of sepsis, growth abnormalities, and congenital abnormalities.

The aim of bilirubin screening is to prevent kernicterus, which results from irreversible deposition of bilirubin in the basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei and requires emergent exchange transfusion.

■ Kernicterus (usually caused by extremely high levels of indirect hyperbili- rubinemia) presents with jaundice, lethargy, poor feeding, a high-pitched cry, hypertonicity, and seizures.

Diagnosis ■ Order a CBC (to assess for anemia), a reticulocyte count, and a peripheral

blood smear (to rule out hemolysis).

■ A Coombs test can distinguish antibody-mediated disease (eg, ABO incompatibility) from non–immune-related disorders (eg, G6PD defi- ciency, hereditary spherocytosis).

Dermatology

Common dermatologic conditions in children include diaper dermatitis, viral exnthems, and eczema (atopic dermatitis)—discussed in the Ambulatory Medicine chapter.

D I A P E R D E R M AT I T I S ( “ D I A P E R R A S H ” )

The skin of the buttocks, groin, and mons pubis is in a moist, warm environ- ment with frequent exposure to bacteria from stool and acidic urine, resulting in skin irritation and barrier disruption. Subtypes include:

■ Irritant diaper dermatitis: Erythema and skin breakdown where the dia- per contacts the skin (classically can avoid skin folds). It generally results from prolonged contact with urine or stool. Treat with frequent diaper changes, cleansing with soap and water, and use of barrier creams or lubri- cants to protect the skin from contact exposure.

■ Candidal diaper dermatitis: Bright red, well-demarcated papules and pustules with satellite lesions, often in skin folds. Consider in the presence of antibiotic use, oral thrush, or diaper dermatitis that is unresponsive to symptomatic treatment. Treat with topical antifungals, keeping the area clean and dry, and use of barrier creams.

A group of disorders caused by a defect in one or more of the enzymes required for glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen synthesis. These defects lead to overproduction of the precursors in the pathway and to an excess of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as the body attempts to stimu- late the adrenal gland. The most common defect, which accounts for 90–95% of all cases, is in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme (see below). Deficiency in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme classically causes buildup of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). Defects in 11β-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase, as well as other enzymes in the pathway for adrenal steroid synthesis, are less common (see Figure 16-4).

History/PE ■ Classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency: More severe than the nonclas- sic form. Has two variants—salt-losing (secondary to aldosterone defi- ciency) and non–salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). ■ Girls with either variant: Present as infants with ambiguous genitalia. ■ Boys with the salt-losing variant: Present in the first 1–2 weeks of life

with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, dehydration, and FTT.

■ Boys with the non–salt-losing variant: Present at 2–4 years of age with early virilization (development of pubic hair, adult body odor, and a growth spurt).

5

KEY FACT

■ Nonclassic (mild) form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency: Typically presents later in life with signs of excess androgen production—hirsutism, acne, early pubarche, irregular menses, and premature closure of the physes.

Children with CAH can have an adrenal crisis with any stressor, including illness or surgery. Presenting symptoms can be fatigue, altered mental status, poor feeding, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypothermia, hypotension, or electrolyte abnormalities. Crisis is treated with stress-dose steroids.
======================================
trEatmEnt ■ Symptom control:

■ Glucocorticoid replacement: Hydrocortisone in infants and younger children; dexamethasone or prednisone in older adolescents.

■ Mineralocorticoid replacement: Fludrocortisone.

■ Monitoring:

■ Serum levels of 17-OHP, androstenedione, and plasma renin activity. ■ Bone-age films and growth/development (especially height).

Normal Puberty ■ Boys: Physical pubertal changes mostly begin at 10–13 years of age. Enlargement of testes → pubic hair and penile growth → growth spurt. ■ Girls: Physical pubertal changes begin at 9–12 years of age. Breast devel-

opment → growth spurt → menarche.

Delayed Puberty The delay or absence of the physical pubertal changes mentioned above by age 14 in boys and age 13 in girls. Axillary and pubic hair development may be noted despite delay because it is not associated with the hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.

■ Puberty delay in boys:

■ Constitutional delayed puberty: More common in boys. Has genetic component. Concomitant with bone-age delay—will undergo puberty, but later in adolescence (15–17 years of age).

■ Other causes: Rare, generally present after 17 years of age, include isolated gonadotropin deficiency (low to nonexistent levels of luteinizing hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH], [LH], and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]); primary gonadal failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) suspected with history of prior testicular malignancy with radiation, cryptorchidism, or testicu- lar torsion, ↑ GnRH; and Klinefelter syndrome.

■ Puberty delay in girls:

■ Constitutional delayed puberty: Suspect if one parent with history of pubertal delay in an otherwise healthy 13–15-year-old girl with no pubertal development; concomitant with bone-age delay.

■ Functional gonadotropin deficiency: ↓ GnRH, LH, and FSH; seen with anorexia nervosa, excessive exercise, as part of the athletic triad, and in girls who have very little body fat for other reasons (ie, chronic disease).

(hypergonadotropic hypogonadism): ↑ GnRH; always consider Turner syndrome, autoimmune disorder affecting the ovaries, or treatment for malignancy including radia- tion and chemotherapy.

Precocious Puberty Defined as the development of 2° sex characteristics before age 8 in girls and age 9 in boys.

■ Gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (GDPP): Presents as nor- mal development but early puberty 2° to early activation of the HPG axis. ∼ 80% of cases are idiopathic. Other etiologies include CNS lesions; therefore, GDPP patients require brain imaging (CT or MRI).

■ Gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (GIPP): Interruption of normal sequence of development 2° to the presence of sex hormones out- side of HPG axis sequence. Possible causes include exogenous estrogen/ testosterone, CAH, and McCune-Albright syndrome. Hormone-secreting tumors are also a possibility: ovarian tumors, Leydig cell tumors, adrenal androgen-secreting tumors, pituitary gonadotropin-secreting tumors.

A 10-day-old male infant is brought to the clinic because he is “acting funny.” He is lethargic with poor skin turgor, a sunken fontanelle, and dry lips. His growth curve reveals that he is < 10% below his birth weight despite frequent breastfeeding with good latch. Labs show hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

In this setting, congenital adrenal hyperplasia must be considered, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione levels must be sent. The newborn screen should also be reviewed to ensure that other metabolic disorders are not missed.

USMLE_FA_Step3_5e_ch16_287-330.indd 306

PEDIATRICS

Diagnosis Determine bone age with x-rays of the hand and wrist.

■ General diagnosis: Determine serum estradiol or testosterone level; 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP); basal and GnRH-stimulated LH; dehydroepiandrosterone. ■ GDPP would show prepubertal LH and FSH levels with appropriate

pubertal response to GnRH stimulation test.

■ GIPP would show low FSH and LH from feedback inhibition from steroids outside of HPG axis. Similarly, GnRH stimulation would pro- duce suppressed response.

■ Specific diagnosis with GIPP can be sought with other labs (estradiol in ovarian tumors, ↑ androgen metabolites in CAH and androgen-secreting tumors, etc.).

trEatmEnt ■ GDPP: GnRH agonists used to ensure patients reach the projected height

or rate of development.

■ GIPP: Does not respond to GnRH agonists; treatment depends on the etiology.

Approximately 20% of children with fever do not have signs or symptoms of a bacterial or viral infection on history or exam. Fever without a source (FWS) is a concern because it may represent an occult serious bacterial infection (SBI).

age dependent. ■ 0–90 days: See the discussion of neonatal sepsis. ■ 3–36 months: If infants in this age group have been vaccinated and appear well, the risk of bacteremia and/or meningitis is low. Consider a UA and urine culture. If unvaccinated, obtain a CBC and a blood cul- ture. Obtain a blood culture and treat with ceftriaxone if the WBC count is > 15.

■ UTI is the most common bacterial cause of FWS. In infants < 3 months of age, uncircumcised boys are at highest risk. Among infants > 3 months of age, Caucasian girls are at highest risk.

■ Children < 2 months of age with their first UTI do not require VCUG unless renal and bladder ultrasounds show abnormal findings, eg, those suggestive of vesicoureteral reflux (see Figure 16-5).

■ Significant debate exists in the literature and in practice regarding the util- ity of VCUG in the setting of a first febrile UTI in children > 2 months of age.

meningitis cases occur in children < 5 years of age. More than 90% of bacte- rial etiologies are 2° to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae.

History/PE ■

Infants and children < 1 year of age may present with nondistinct symp- toms such as irritability, vomiting, poor feeding, hypo- or hyperthermia, apnea, lethargy, and seizure activity.

■ Older children may demonstrate similar symptoms but may also present with photosensitivity, headache, and neck stiffness, although these symp- toms may be difficult to elicit depending on the child’s age and cooperation with the examiner. Older children may also exhibit signs and symptoms commonly seen in adults, including ⊕ Kernig and Brudzinski signs.

■ Children with Lyme and bacterial meningitis may demonstrate cranial nerve palsies.

Diagnosis ■ Depending on the clinical presentation and history, consider a CT scan if there is concern for intracranial bleeding, ↑ intracranial pressure, or trauma.

■ Blood tests include a CBC, a chemistry panel that includes serum sodium and glucose levels, a blood culture, and a UA and urine culture. Serum sodium is important in view of risk of hyponatremia 2° to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Serum glucose is used as a direct comparison to CSF glucose measurement. Consider full-panel sepsis labs.

■ Additional tests include lumbar puncture (LP) with CSF analysis to exam- ine the color of the supernatant, cell counts with differential, protein, glu- cose, microscopic evaluation, and bacterial culture. Table 16-8 describes

A relatively common medium-vessel vasculitis of childhood that predisposes to coronary artery aneurysms and to the subsequent development of myocar- dial ischemia. It is more common in children < 5 years of age and among those of Asian, particularly Japanese, ethnicity.

History/PE Presents as an acute illness characterized by the symptoms outlined in the CRASH and BURN mnemonic. Children tend to be highly irritable.

Diagnosis ■ Diagnosis is clinical. ■ Patients must have fever for > 5 days and meet four to five of the following criteria: Conjunctivitis, rash, at least one cervical node > 1 cm, oropha- ryngeal mucosal changes, hand/foot swelling, and/or desquamation.

■ Occasional findings include arthritis, scrotal swelling, pericarditis, and gallbladder inflammation.

■ Labs may reveal sterile pyuria on clean-catch urine (catheterization bypasses the urethral origin of pyuria), ↑ erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)/C-reactive protein (CRP), thrombocytosis, ↑ transaminases, hypoal- buminemia, and hyponatremia.

■ Echocardiography may reveal coronary artery aneurysms.
======================================
trEatmEnt ■ Give high-dose aspirin during the acute phase for its anti-inflammatory

properties and to ↓ the risk of thrombosis.

■ Administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to prevent coronary artery aneurysms (given as a single infusion within the first 7–10 days of ill- ness; repeat if the patient is still febrile 24 hours later).

■ During the convalescent phase, switch to low-dose aspirin for its antiplate- let effect.

■ Follow patients with repeated echocardiography and cardiology follow-up.

ComPliCations Myocarditis, pericarditis, coronary artery aneurysm predisposing to myocardial ischemia.

■ Age of symptom onset. ■ Number and type of joints involved. ■ The presence of other systemic symptoms. ■ Clinical course for 6 months after diagnosis.

There are three main categories: systemic, pauciarticular, and polyarticular.

Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Presents with intermittent fever, rash (macular and salmon-pink), and arthritis (usually of the knees, wrists, and ankles, but can affect other joints as well). Diagnosed in patients < 16 years of age; after this age, it is considered adult- onset Still disease. Affects boys and girls equally.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: NSAIDs. ■ Second line: Corticosteroids; nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheu- matic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate; biologic DMARDs, includ- ing IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors.

■ Other: Agents such as thalidomide, IVIG, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasala- zine, cyclosporine, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have been used with varying degrees of success.

■ Course: The initial episode of JIA may last 4–6 months. Some children will continue to have fever and rash for years. The long-term sequelae vary from none at all to severe destruction requiring joint replacement.

Pauciarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The most common form of JIA; affects girls more often than boys. Also called oligoarticular arthritis. Involves < 5 joints (generally large joints); usually presents at age 2–3.

Diagnosis Workup for systemic JIA (see above). Patients exhibit antinuclear antibody (ANA) ⊕.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: NSAIDs and/or glucocorticoids injected into affected joints. ■ Second line: Methotrexate, TNF inhibitors (rarely used). ■ Course: Usually resolves within 6 months. More than 50% of patients will

not have relapses; however, severe destructive arthritis may occur.

Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Involves > 4 joints; affects girls more often than boys. Age of onset is 2–5 years and 10–14 years.

Diagnosis Workup for systemic JIA (see above). Patients may be positive for ANA and/or rheumatoid factor (RF); lab findings may include anemia, ↑ ESR, and hypergammaglobulinemia.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: NSAIDs but this is unlikely to yield long-term control when

used as a single agent.

■ DMARDs such as methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, TNF inhibi- tors, cyclosporine, azathioprine, rituximab, corticosteroids (systemic and injected), and gold compounds should be added early in the course of treatment.

■ Course: The prognosis is generally better for RF-seronegative patients than for those who are seropositive. RF-seronegative patients often respond to NSAID therapy, whereas seropositive patients require treatment with DMARDs.

A healthy child is unlikely to have multiple severe infections in different anatomic locations. Therefore, 1° immunodeficiency and other chronic diseases should be considered. Accordingly, a CBC, immunoglobulin levels, antibody titers to vaccinations, and a CH50 should be ordered. More specific tests (eg, HIV, CF) can be ordered if indicated.

PEDIATRICS

H E N O C H - S C H Ö N L E I N P U R P U R A

The most common small-vessel vasculitis of childhood. It is typically preceded by upper respiratory infection (URI) a few weeks before symptom onset.

History/PE ■ Palpable purpura (see Figure 16-6). ■ Fever. ■ Arthritis/arthralgia: Usually migratory, affecting the large joints of the

lower extremities more often than the upper extremities.

■ Glomerulonephritis: If renal involvement occurs, it is usually seen within 4 weeks of presentation and is typically self-limited.

■ Abdominal pain: Results from bowel wall edema and inflammation and may be treated with systemic corticosteroids if severe.

Diagnosis ■ Based on clinical presentation. If unclear, a skin or kidney biopsy with evi-

dence of IgA deposits can confirm the diagnosis.

■ Labs may show thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, anemia; ↑ ESR, IgA, IgM; UA with RBCs and leukocytes; anticardiolipin or antiphospholipid antibodies.

trEatmEnt Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain control +/− glucocorticoids. This is another situation where aspirin may be given if there is concern that the patient is at ↑ risk for thrombotic events.

ComPliCations ■ ■ Recurs in roughly one-third of cases.

Intussusception due to bowel wall edema and inflammation can occur.
======================================
Cardiology

The most common congenital heart lesion is ventricular septal defect (VSD), followed by atrial septal defect (ASD). The most common cyanotic lesion is transposition of the great arteries (TGA).

V E N T R I C U L A R S E P TA L D E F E C T

A hole in the ventricular septum. Can be membranous (least likely to close spontaneously), perimembranous, or muscular (most likely to close spontaneously).

History/PE ■ May be asymptomatic at birth if the lesion is small. ■ Cardiac exam may reveal a holosystolic, vibratory murmur at the left lower

sternal border without radiation to the axilla.

■ May become symptomatic between 2 and 6 months of age. Symptoms result

from flow across the defect, usually from the left to the right ventricle. If the lesion is large, it may present with symptoms of heart failure (HF), including shortness of breath, pulmonary edema; frequent respiratory infection; FTT; and exercise/feeding intolerance (sweating with feeds).

■ Look for cardiomegaly and crackles on exam (signs of right HF).

PEDIATRICS

Diagnosis ■ ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and left ventricular

hypertrophy.

■ CXR may show pulmonary edema. ■ Echocardiography is definitive.

trEatmEnt ■ Treat HF if present. ■ Follow small, asymptomatic VSDs. ■ Surgically repair large or membranous VSDs to prevent subsequent devel- opment of HF and pulmonary hypertension. Also repair VSDs in patients exhibiting FTT.

ComPliCations If left untreated, VSD may lead to irreversible Eisenmenger syndrome (pul- monary hypertension, RVH, and reversal of left-to-right shunt).

AT R I A L S E P TA L D E F E C T

A hole in the atrial septum.

History/PE ■ Typically asymptomatic until late childhood or early adulthood. ■ Cardiac exam may reveal a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal

border.

■ A loud S1 with a wide and fixed, split S2 and a heaving cardiac impulse at the left lower sternal border are characteristic signs.

■ Progression to HF and cyanosis may occur in the second or third decade of life and depends on the size of the lesion.

Diagnosis ■ ECG may show left-axis deviation. ■ CXR reveals cardiomegaly and ↑ pulmonary vascularity (if the defect is

large).

■ Echocardiography is definitive.

trEatmEnt ■ Treat HF if present; follow small ASDs. ■ Surgically repair large ASDs in patients with HF and repair before the

third decade to prevent symptoms.

■ Patient will also need surgery if there is a history of paradoxical embolic event.

ComPliCations Eisenmenger syndrome, dysrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension.

PAT E N T D U C T U S A R T E R I O S U S

■ Failure of the ductus arteriosus (the connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta) to close in the first few days of life. Usually results in a left- to-right shunt (from the aorta to the pulmonary artery). Risk factors include prematurity, high altitude, and maternal first-trimester rubella infection. ■ Hx/PE: Presentation ranges from asymptomatic to HF. Cardiac exam may reveal a wide pulse pressure; a continuous “machinery” murmur at the left upper sternal border; and bounding peripheral pulses.

PEDIATRICS

■ Dx: Echocardiography is definitive, showing shunt flow as well as left atrial and left ventricular enlargement.

■ Tx: If diagnosed within days of birth, use indomethacin to close the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Surgical repair is indicated if indomethacin fails or the infant is > 6–8 months of age.

■ Cx: In pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (eg, meconium aspiration syndrome), flow may be right to left across a PDA, resulting in persistent cyanosis/hypoxia. A reduction of pulmonary hypertension is required to reduce the right-to-left flow. Do not close the PDA in ductal-dependent cyanotic heart lesions (eg, TGA). To keep the ductus open, prostaglandin E1 may be indicated until definitive repair can be performed.

T E T R A LO G Y O F FA L LO T

■ Consists of 4 lesions (see the mnemonic PROVe). ■ Hx/PE: Presentation ranges from acyanotic (“pink tet”) to profound cya- nosis. Most patients have some cyanosis depending on the severity of pul- monary stenosis and the relative right and left ventricular pressures (which determine the direction of flow across the VSD). Cardiac exam may reveal a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border along with right ven- tricular lift and possible thrill along the left sternal border.

■ Dx: Echocardiography is definitive. CXR shows a boot-shaped heart. ■ Tx: If a newborn with this condition is cyanotic, administer prostaglandin E to maintain the PDA. Cyanotic “tet spells” may occur in a child who is crying or overheated. These children should be calmed and given O2; squatting or other measures (fluids, morphine, propranolol, and phenyl- ephrine if severe) can be used to ↑ systemic vascular resistance and restore left-to-right flow across the VSD. Surgical repair is necessary.

T R A N S P O S I T I O N O F T H E G R E AT A R T E R I E S

The aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. TGA will present shortly following delivery.

History/PE ■ Presents with extreme cyanosis from birth. ■ There may be no murmur. ■ A single, loud S2 is characteristic.

Diagnosis ■ Echocardiography is definitive. ■ CXR shows an “egg on a string.” ■ An O2 saturation monitor on the right arm (measuring “preductal” satura- tion) will show a lower O2 saturation than the one on the lower extremity (“postductal” saturation).

trEatmEnt ■ Administer prostaglandin E1 to maintain the PDA. ■

If necessary, a “balloon septostomy” (Rashkind procedure) may be per- formed to rupture the atrial septum, thereby improving the mixing of venous and arterial blood and ensuring that adequately saturated blood enters the aorta.

■ Surgical repair is necessary.

■ Narrowing of the lumen of the aorta leads to ↓ blood flow below the obstruction and ↑ flow above it, resulting in upper extremity hypertension and cardiomegaly. Risk factors include Turner syndrome and male gender. Coarctation of the aorta is also associated with bicuspid aortic valve.

■ Hx/PE: Presents with dyspnea with exertion, systemic hypoperfusion/ shock, and syncope. Cardiac exam may reveal hypertension in the upper extremities and a lower BP in the lower extremities. ↓ Femoral and distal lower extremity pulses are characteristic.

■ Dx: Echocardiography or catheterization is definitive. CXR shows rib notching due to collateral circulation through the intercostal arteries.

■ Tx: Surgical repair or balloon angioplasty +/− stent placement. ■ Cx: Often recurs and carries an ↑ risk of intracranial hemorrhage due to

cerebral aneurysms.

■ Electrolytes show hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis due to emesis.

■ Barium studies show a “string sign” (a narrow pylorus) or a pyloric beak.

trEatmEnt ■ First manage dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. ■ Surgical repair consists of pyloromyotomy.

Telescoping of a bowel segment into itself (see Figure 16-8). May lead to edema, arterial occlusion, gut necrosis, and death. Intussusception is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in the first 2 years of life. It is usually idiopathic in children < 2 years of age and often has an identifiable “lead point” (eg, a lymph node) in children > 5 years of age.

History/PE ■ The classic presentation consists of paroxysmal abdominal pain. The child is often comfortable between paroxysms. Vomiting and heme ⊕ stools may be seen. “Currant jelly” stool (reddish-purple stool mixed with mucus and blood) is a late finding.

■ May present with altered mental status (lethargy or even obtundation) and may be preceded by a viral illness.

■ Abdominal exam may reveal a palpable sausage-shaped mass.

Diagnosis ■ Abdominal ultrasound is the initial step for workup. ■ An air-contrast enema or a water-soluble contrast enema is both diagnostic

and therapeutic for ileocecal intussusceptions.

trEatmEnt ■ Following reduction via enema, treat with supportive care. ■

If reduction fails or if perforation is suspected, surgical intervention may be required.

Distinguished as follows:

■ Malrotation: Failure of gut rotation in the abdominal cavity during the tenth week of gestation. Results in abnormal location of intestinal contents as well as incomplete fixation to the posterior abdominal wall. May predis- pose to intestinal obstruction or volvulus.

■ Volvulus: A complication of malrotation in which the malrotated gut twists on the axis of the superior mesenteric artery, resulting in intestinal obstruction and ischemia.

History/PE ■ First 3 weeks of life: Volvulus presents as acute onset of bilious emesis,

small bowel obstruction, or bowel necrosis.

■ Later in infancy/early childhood: Malrotation may present as acute or intermittent intestinal obstruction, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropa- thy, or diarrhea.

ComPliCations ■ The 1° complication following surgical bowel resection is short bowel syn- drome, which occurs when < 30 cm of short bowel is left, resulting in poor intestinal absorption. If a large segment of bowel is lost as a result of bowel ischemia or surgery, the condition may also lead to malnutrition, TPN dependence, and liver failure.

A remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct that persists as an outpouching of the distal ileum. It can contain ectopic (usually gastric or pancreatic) mucosa.

History/PE ■ Often asymptomatic. ■ Patients may present with painless rectal bleeding or intussusception (with

Meckel diverticulum as the lead point).

Diagnosis ■ Order a technetium radionuclide scan (“Meckel scan”) to detect gastric

mucosa.

■ The gold standard is tissue obtained surgically.

trEatmEnt ■ Stabilize the patient with IV fluids; transfuse if needed. ■ Surgical exploration is indicated if the patient is symptomatic. ■ Bowel resection may be required with resection of diverticula depending

on the location and complexity of the lesion.

N E C R O T I Z I N G E N T E R O C O LO T I S

Intestinal necrosis occurring primarily in a watershed distribution. It is the most common GI emergency of newborns. Risk factors include prematurity and congenital heart disease.

History/PE ■ Presents with abdominal distention, retention of gastric contents and feeds, abdominal wall tenderness and discoloration, and bloody stools. ■ Nonspecific symptoms include apnea, respiratory failure, lethargy, poor feeding, temperature instability, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, and hypotension/shock.

Diagnosis AXR shows pneumatosis intestinalis and possibly portal venous gas and free intraperitoneal air (see Figure 16-10).

trEatmEnt ■ Medical management: With IV fluids (no enteral feeds) and antibiotics if the patient is hemodynamically stable and/or too small or sick to go to the OR.

In celiac disease (also known as celiac sprue, see Chapter 7), infants will present with failure to thrive, and children will present with small stature, chronic diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia, and a rash.

Diagnosis ■ Fat malabsorption: Conduct a Sudan black test initially; 72-hour stool test

for fecal fat is confirmatory.

■ Protein malabsorption: Conduct a stool α-1 antitrypsin test. To confirm celiac disease, start with antitransglutaminase antibodies; intestinal biopsy showing blunted villi is most specific.

An acute viral inflammatory disease of the larynx/subglottic space (see Table 16-10). Most common in children 3 months to 3 years of age. Commonly caused by parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 but may also be caused by other PIVs as well as by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, rubeola, adeno- virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

History/PE ■ Typically has a 1- to 2-day viral prodrome with URI symptoms. ■ Also presents with low-grade fever, mild dyspnea, and inspiratory stridor that worsens with agitation and may improve with cool air or a warm shower.

■ Listen for the characteristic barking cough.

Diagnosis ■ Based on clinical findings. ■ A “steeple sign” formed by subglottic narrowing may be seen on frontal

neck x-ray (see Figure 16-11A).

trEatmEnt ■ Mist therapy (for mild croup only); oral or IM/IV dexamethasone (for mild or moderate croup); nebulized racemic epinephrine if stridor is present at rest.

■ Order heliox and ICU admission for severe croup.

■ Heliox is typically administered at a ratio of 70% helium to 30% O2 to ↓ the resistance of airflow through a narrowed airway by replacing nitrogen with helium.

A serious and rapidly progressive infection of the epiglottis and contiguous structures that can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction. It is increas- ingly rare because of the Hib vaccine to prevent H influenza infection and is now most commonly caused by S pneumoniae or S aureus.

History/Exam ■ Maintain a high index of suspicion in children with sudden-onset high fever, dysphagia, drooling, a muffled voice, inspiratory retractions, cyano- sis, and soft stridor.

■ Patients may be in the “sniffing” position, with the neck hyperextended and the chin protruding. These patients should be identified and stabi- lized rapidly, as the disease can quickly progress to complete airway obstruction and respiratory arrest.

Diagnosis ■ Based on the clinical picture. ■ Do not attempt to examine the throat unless the patient is in the OR with

an anesthesiologist present.

■ Lateral neck films show the characteristic “thumbprint sign” of a swollen epiglottis (see Figure 16-11B).

trEatmEnt ■ Keep the patient calm, call anesthesia and otolaryngology immediately, and transfer to the OR. If the patient is unstable, do not delay treatment by getting a neck film.

■ Treat with endotracheal intubation and IV antibiotics.

Commonly known as “whooping cough.” The causative agent is Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis.

History/PE The disease has three stages:

■ Catarrhal: Presents with nasal congestion, sneezing, and low-grade fever. ■ Paroxysmal: Presents with intense coughing paroxysms followed by a “whoop” in young children. Neonates and infants may experience cyano- sis and apnea after coughing fits.

■ Convalescent: Characterized by a chronic cough that may last for weeks (also known as “hundred-day cough”). Patients are no longer shedding the organism during this phase.

Diagnosis Nasopharyngeal swab that is ⊕ by PCR or culture for B pertussis.

trEatmEnt ■ Erythromycin or azithromycin is recommended if the diagnosis is made

before the convalescent phase, when the patient is still contagious.

■ Vaccination is key to preventing asymptomatic family members from spreading the infection to children.

The most common lower respiratory illness in childhood and a leading cause of hospitalization in infants and young children. Peak incidence is at 2–8 months of age, from October to March. Symptoms are due to virally induced inflammation of the small airways, resulting in edema, mucous plug- ging, and sloughing of epithelial cells, causing bronchiolar obstruction.

History/PE ■

Infants present with fever, nasal congestion, and varying degrees of hypox- emia, tachypnea, retractions, and loud rhonchi on lung exam.

■ Wheezing can occur, especially in children with no personal or family his- tory of wheeze.

Diagnosis ■ Clinical diagnosis is based on the characteristic age, history, and exam

■ Can be caused by many viruses; RSV, influenza, human metapneumovi- rus, and rhinovirus are common viral causes and are tested by nasopharyn- geal swab.

■ CXR shows nonspecific bilateral perihilar infiltrates as well as hyperinfla- tion and peribronchial cuffing.

trEatmEnt ■ Provide supportive care with nasal suctioning, nebulized hypertonic saline, and O2. Because infants and young children are obligate nose breathers, feeding difficulties may occur when they are in respiratory dis- tress, necessitating close management of hydration and nutrition.

■ Patients may or may not respond to albuterol, racemic epinephrine, and/or systemic corticosteroids. Use of these medications is not routinely recommended.

■ Ribavirin can be used for immunocompromised patients and/or severe cases. Endotracheal intubation is indicated for respiratory failure.

Will be either viral or bacterial; presentation will differ based on etiology. The most common bacterial organisms are S pneumoniae, M pneumoniae, or C pneumoniae.

History/PE ■ Viral: Tachypnea, low-grade fever, URI symptoms. ■ Bacterial: High fever, chills, pleuritic pain, diminished breath sounds.

Diagnosis ■ CXR: Hyperinflation with interstitial infiltrates (viral) or lobar consolida-

tion (bacterial).

■ CBC: WBC count normal or mildly ↑ in viral pneumonia; very ↑ in bac- terial pneumonia.

■ Viral antigens: IgM titers (for M pneumoniae). ■ Blood cultures.

suspected cause).

■ Chlamydia or Mycoplasma: Erythromycin.

C Y S T I C F I B R O S I S

A mutation of the CFTR gene in which an abnormal CFTR protein functions as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel and other ion channels, resulting in multisystem dysfunction.

■ Frequently diagnosed in childhood; only ∼5% of cases are diagnosed in adulthood.

■ Most often affects the lungs, resulting in chronic bacterial infections and bronchiectasis, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, abnormal sweat produc- tion, intestinal dysfunction, and urodynamics (see Chapter 18 for more detailed coverage).

Neurology  F E B R I L E   S E I Z U R E S 

Benign, self-limited seizures that occur in children 6 months to 6 years of age at the onset of a febrile illness. A ⊕ family history is common. Febrile sei- zures may be simple or complex:

■ Simple: A generalized seizure characterized by a short duration (< 15 min- utes), one seizure per 24-hour period, and a quick return to normal func- tion with no residual focal neurologic deficit.

■ Complex: A seizure associated with a febrile illness that does not meet the above criteria. The seizure may be focal; may have a longer duration (> 15 minutes); may recur in a 24-hour period; or may result in incom- plete or slow return to normal neurologic status.

Diagnosis/trEatmEnt ■ Simple: Treatment is focused on determining the source of the fever and providing supportive care, but no further neurologic evaluation is needed. ■ Complex: Depending on the history, the severity of the seizure, and exam findings, consider performing laboratory or radiologic workup for other eti- ologies of seizure, such as electrolyte abnormalities, toxic ingestion, sepsis, CNS infection, or CNS trauma.

■ Strongly consider LP in patients < 12 months of age with complex febrile seizures as well as in any child who has focal neurologic deficits before or after the seizure.

■ EEG and MRI are not routinely recommended for children with febrile seizures. They may be considered on an outpatient basis in a child with a complex febrile seizure, especially a focal seizure or one resulting in pro- longed neurologic defects.

■ Family education and anticipatory guidance are essential. Although febrile seizures are benign, 30–50% of children with a febrile seizure will have another one before they outgrow the syndrome.

■ Febrile seizures cannot be prevented with the use of antipyretics, and anti- convulsants are not routinely recommended. Complications from anticon- vulsant use typically outweigh their utility.

History/PE ■ Patients may have abdominal pain or may present with a painless abdomi-

nal or flank mass.

■ Hematuria and hypertension are commonly seen. ■ Systemic symptoms include weight loss, nausea, emesis, bone pain, dys-

uria, and polyuria.

Diagnosis ■ Best initial test: Abdominal CT or ultrasound. ■ CXR, chest CT, CBC, LFTs, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine

can be used to assess severity and spread.

■ Definitive diagnosis confirmed histologically after biopsy or surgical resection.

trEatmEnt ■ Transabdominal nephrectomy followed by postoperative chemotherapy. ■ Flank irradiation is of benefit in some higher-stage cases. ■ The prognosis is usually very good but depends on staging and tumor

histology.

N E U R O B L A S T O M A

A tumor of neural crest cell origin that most commonly affects children < 5 years of age; it is the most common solid tumor during infancy. Risk fac- tors include neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, pheochromocytoma, and Hirschsprung disease.

History/PE ■ Presentations include abdominal mass/distention/hepatomegaly, anorexia, weight loss, bone pain, respiratory distress, fatigue, fever, diarrhea, irritabil- ity, or neuromuscular symptoms (if paraspinal). Patient will often appear systemically ill (differentiates from Wilms tumor).

■ Soft tissue and bony lesions can appear anywhere in the body (eg, the skin or skull).

■ Other symptoms include leg edema (abdominal tumors compress venous or lymphatic drainage), hypertension, and periorbital bruising (“raccoon eyes”).

Diagnosis ■ Definitive diagnosis is based on a tumor tissue sample with or without ↑ urine catecholamines (vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid) or on metastases to bone marrow with ↑ urine catecholamines.

■ The initial workup generally includes a CBC, electrolytes, lactate dehy- drogenase, ferritin, LFTs, a coagulation screen, urine catecholamines, and BUN/creatinine.

■ To stage and assess severity, obtain bone marrow biopsies, an abdominal CT or MRI, a CXR, bone radiographs, and a technetium radionuclide scan or 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan.

trEatmEnt ■ Localized, low-risk tumors are usually cured with excision. ■ Chemotherapy includes cyclophosphamide, carboplatin or cisplatin, eto-

poside or teniposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin.

The most common intraocular malignancy in children and is usually diag- nosed before age 2. One-quarter of cases are bilateral.

History/PE ■ Usually presents with leukocoria and/or strabismus. ■ Can be sporadic or inherited; the inherited form is associated with an ↑ risk of additional malignancies, including osteogenic sarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas, and malignant melanoma.

■ Generally begins to metastasize within 6 months, so early diagnosis is critical.

Diagnosis Made by indirect ophthalmoscopic exam (with dilated pupils).

trEatmEnt ■ Determined by the size and location of the tumor. ■ Options include enucleation, external beam radiation therapy, radioactive plaque therapy (125I brachytherapy), cryotherapy with laser photocoagula- tion, and chemotherapy.

Benzodiazepines ■ Applications: Used for anxiety, agitation, catatonia, alcohol withdrawal,

Applications: Used for anxiety, agitation, catatonia, alcohol withdrawal, insomnia, anesthesia, seizures, and muscle spasms.

insomnia, anesthesia, seizures, and muscle spasms. ■ Rapid onset of action; augment sedation and respiratory depression

from other CNS depressants (eg, alcohol, opiates).

■ When possible, use only on a short-term basis (eg, no more than 2–3 months) or PRN.

■ Interactions: P-450 inhibitors (eg, cimetidine, fluoxetine) ↑ levels; induc- ers (carbamazepine and rifampin) ↓ levels.

■ Relative contraindications: Disadvantages include a risk of abuse, toler-

ance, dependence, and withdrawal (can be life-threatening). ■ May also induce delirium in the elderly and/or critically ill patients. ■ Avoid in patients who are at high risk for falling. ■ Avoid in patients on chronic opiate therapy due to the risk of respira- tory suppression, death, and overdose. Can cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome if taken in pregnancy.

Zolpidem A nonbenzodiazepine used for insomnia. ↓ Sleep latency and ↑ total sleep time. Has rapid onset and can be habit forming and lead to problematic or dangerous sleep behaviors (eg, “sleep driving,” “sleep eating”). Withdrawal is uncommon.

Buspirone ■ Mechanism of action: A 5-HT1A (serotonin receptor) partial agonist. ■ Applications: Used for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and chronic anxiety; and for patients with a history of substance abuse. Unlike benzodi- azepines, it has no anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties. Also has few side effects and no tolerance, dependence, or withdrawal.

■ Relative contraindications: Has slow onset of action and lower efficacy than benzodiazepines. Should not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Not effective as a PRN anxiolytic.

Antihistamines Used for the short-term management of insomnia and for preoperative seda- tion. Can be used PRN for anxiety. Diphenhydramine can be used to treat acute extrapyramidal symptoms.
======================================
A N T I D E P R E S S A N T S

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ■

Include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, and fluvoxamine.

■ Applications: First-line therapy for depression, obsessive-compulsive disor- der (OCD) (generally requires high doses), and many anxiety disorders. ■ Well tolerated, effective, and relatively safe in overdose. ■ Combine with psychotherapy for synergistic effect.

■ Continue treatment at therapeutic dose for 6 months following remis- sion in patients with first episode of depression then consider tapering and discontinuing. More severe, chronic, frequent episodes of depres- sion may require lifelong treatment.

■ Medications that a family member responded to are often a good first choice.

■ Interactions: Can ↑ warfarin levels because of P-450 interactions. ■ Side effects: Sexual dysfunction, which often persists. GI upset, bruis- ing, headache, anxiety, weight gain or loss, and sleep disturbance often resolve with time. An adequate trial is at least 6 weeks. If side effects are intolerable, switch agents. Black box warning: Selective serotonin reup- take inhibitors (SSRIs) may lead to ↑ suicidal thoughts and behaviors in those < 24 years.

Atypical Antidepressants ■ Bupropion:

■ Mechanism of action: Dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

■ Applications: First-line therapy for depression and smoking cessation. Effective for patients who have had sexual side effects from other anti- depressants. Can be used as augmentation if fatigue, weight gain, low energy, or apathy are persistent.

■ Side effects: Anxiety, agitation, and insomnia can occur. Can worsen tics. Lowers seizure threshold, especially in high doses. Not associated with weight gain.

■ Relative contraindications: A history of seizure disorder, active eating disorders, or head trauma.

■ Venlafaxine/Desvenlafaxine and Duloxetine:

■ Mechanism of action: 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition. ■ Applications: Used for major depression, social anxiety, and GAD. ■ Side effects: Adverse effects include hypertension (monitor BP), insomnia, nervousness, sedation, constipation, sexual dysfunction, and nausea.

■ Mirtazapine:

■ Mechanism of action: An α2-antagonist that enhances NE and 5-HT. Does not affect the P-450 system.

■ Side effects: Sedation (worse in lower doses) and weight gain. Has little effect on sexual function.

■ Trazodone:

■ Mechanism of action: 5-HT2A antagonism. At lower doses, may be helpful in insomnia.

■ Side effects: Sedation, priapism.
======================================
Tricyclic Antidepressants ■

Include nortriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomip- ramine, and doxepin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are considered to be second-line agents owing to their side effect profile, along with the risk of dysrhythmias and death in overdose.

■ Mechanism of action: Block the reuptake of NE and 5-HT. ■ Applications: Useful for chronic pain and migraines. OCD responds to clomipramine. Consider imipramine for enuresis and amitriptyline for neuropathic pain.

■ Interactions: Levels ↑ when used with SSRIs because of P-450 inhibition. ■ Side effects: Anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurry vision, constipa- tion, urinary retention). Sedation, weight gain. Orthostatic hypotension;

cardiac conduction delays with prolonged PR and QRS intervals. Contra- indicated in patients with a history of severe heart disease and in those at high risk for suicide. Use with caution in elderly persons.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ■

Include phenelzine, selegiline, and tranylcypromine. MAOIs are second- line agents owing to their side effect profile and dietary restrictions. ■ Side effects:

■ Orthostatic hypotension, insomnia, weight gain, edema, and sexual dysfunction are common.

■ May lead to tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis. Culprits are aged cheese, chocolate, certain alcohol, pickled foods.

■ Potentially fatal serotonin syndrome can occur if MAOIs are combined with SSRIs, TCAs, meperidine, fentanyl, or indirect sympathomimetics (eg, those found in some over-the-counter [OTC] cold remedies). Can be prevented with washout period when switching to MAOIs from other antidepressants—fluoxetine has the longest half-life and requires at least a 5-week washout.

St. John’s Wort OTC herbal supplement used for mild cases of depression. Use caution as it induces P450 and has multiple drug interactions.

First-Generation (“Typical”) Antipsychotics ■ Mechanism of action: Act through dopamine receptor blockade. ■ Applications: Used for psychotic disorders and acute agitation. Haloperi- dol can be used to treat dangerous agitation in delirium. Examples include: ■ High-potency agents (haloperidol, fluphenazine): ↓ Only positive symptoms of psychosis. Associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms.

■ Low-potency agents (thioridazine, chlorpromazine): Associated with more sedation, anticholinergic effects, and hypotension.

■ Side effects: Extrapyramidal symptoms from excessive cholinergic effect (see Table 17-1), hyperprolactinemia (amenorrhea, gynecomastia, galac- torrhea), anticholinergic effects, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, weight gain, sedation.

Second-Generation (“Atypical”) Antipsychotics ■ Risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole are commonly used. Lurasidone, iloperidone, and paliperidone are newer agents. Clozapine is reserved for treatment-refractory psychosis; it is highly effective and reduces risk of suicide but requires intensive monitoring. ■ Mechanism of action: Act through 5-HT2 and dopamine antagonism. ■ Applications: Currently first-line therapy for schizophrenia. Benefits are fewer extrapyramidal symptoms and anticholinergic effects than first- generation agents. Also used for severe tic disorders. Can treat acute mania; may be required as augmentation with mood stabilizer.
======================================
Side effects:

■ May cause sedation, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, anticholinergic effects, and QT prolongation. Obtain baseline values and monitor the patient’s weight, lipid profile, and glucose levels.

■ Clozapine may also cause sialorrhea (drooling), agranulocytosis, myo- carditis, severe constipation, and seizures (requires CBCs weekly dur- ing the first 6 months, followed by biweekly for 6 months, then monthly monitoring for the remainder of treatment).

When using lithium, monitor renal and thyroid function. Long-term use can lead to hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, and nephrotoxicity.

M O O D S TA B I L I Z E R S

Lithium ■ Applications: Used for long-term maintenance or prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and for both depression and mania. ↓ Suicidal behavior/risk in bipolar disorder. Has a narrow therapeutic index and requires monitoring of serum levels.

■ Side effects:

■ Thirst, polyuria, fine tremor, weight gain, diarrhea, nausea, acne, and hypothyroidism.

■ Lithium toxicity presents with a coarse tremor, ataxia, vomiting, confu- sion, seizures, and arrhythmias.

_

5

KEY FACT

Dehydration, diuretics, NSAIDs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and hyponatremia can increase lithium levels dangerously. Severe toxicity may require hemodialysis.

■ Teratogenic. Risk of Ebstein anomaly in pregnancy, particularly in first trimester (though this is rare and safer than valproate in pregnancy).

Valproic Acid ■ Applications: First-line agent for acute mania and bipolar disorder; effec-

tive in rapid cyclers (those with four or more episodes per year).

■ Side effects:

■ Sedation, weight gain, hair loss, tremor, ataxia, GI distress. ■ Pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia, and fatal hepatotoxicity can occur. Do

not use in patients with cirrhosis or severe hepatitis.

■ Monitor platelets, liver function tests (LFTs), and serum drug levels. All mood stabilizers are associated with highest risk of teratogenicity (neural tube defects).

The most common childhood psychiatric disorder.

History/PE ■ Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) presents before age 12. ■

It involves six or more symptoms for 6 months of either inattention (eg, easy distractibility, difficulty following instructions/finishing tasks, disorga- nization) or hyperactivity/impulsivity (eg, fidgeting/interrupting others/ difficulty waiting) in two or more settings (school, work, home). ■ Many children will continue to have symptoms through adulthood.

trEatmEnt ■ Pharmacotherapy is generally first line except in young children (< 6 years) for whom behavior modification is preferred and in patients with contraindi- cations to medication (eg, severely underweight).

■ Pharmacologic approaches include stimulants (eg, amphetamines, meth- ylphenidate) or nonstimulant medications (eg, atomoxetine, α2-agonists, bupropion).

■ Stimulants have not been shown to lead to substance use disorders. However, if there is a history of substance abuse, a nonstimulant may be preferable.

Distinguished as follows:

■ Tic: A sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocal- ization. Common but often transient.

■ Tourette syndrome: Multiple motor and vocal tics such as blinking, gri- macing, or grunting that occur many times a day for > 1 year and cause functional impairment. It is associated with ADHD and OCD. Treat with dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, haloperidol, pimozide), clonidine, and behavioral therapy. Stimulants can worsen or precipitate tics.

Of these, delu- sions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech must be present. Continuous signs of the disturbance must persist for at least 6 months. ■ Positive symptoms: Bizarre delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts/speech/behavior. Hallucinations are usually auditory (eg, run- ning commentary/monologues or conversations between two voices) but may also be visual, tactile, or, rarely, olfactory.

■ Negative symptoms: Affective flattening, avolition, apathy, alogia.

DiffErEntial ■ Brief psychotic disorder: Symptoms are of < 1 month’s duration; onset

often follows a psychosocial stressor.

■ Postpartum psychosis: A psychiatric emergency due to ↑ risk of infanti- cide. Some clinical features of delirium; more likely in mothers who have bipolar disorder. Treat with lithium and antipsychotics.

■ Schizophreniform disorder: Diagnostic criteria are the same as those for schizophrenia, but symptoms have a duration of 1–6 months. Estimated 60–80% will progress to schizophrenia.

■ Schizoaffective disorder: Mood symptoms are present for a significant portion of the illness, but psychotic symptoms have been present for at least 2 weeks without a mood episode.

■ Delusional disorder: Nonbizarre delusions for 1 month or more in the absence of other psychotic symptoms; often chronic, typically responds poorly to antipsychotics.

■ Other: Schizotypal personality disorder; mood disorder with psychotic fea- tures (contrast with schizoaffective disorder); substance-induced psychosis (eg, dopaminergic medications, including carbidopa-levodopa or illicit drugs such as amphetamines) or drug withdrawal (eg, alcoholic hallucino- sis); psychosis due to a general medical condition (eg, brain tumor); delir- ium or dementia; shared psychotic disorder.

and intoxication. ■ Check thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), electrolytes, drug screen. ■

In selected patients, may also consider checking VDRL to rule out syphilis and EEG to look for epilepsy.

trEatmEnt ■ Hospitalize if the patient is a danger to self or to others. ■ Treat with antipsychotic medications (neuroleptics). ■ Provide psychosocial treatments, social skills training (particularly for neg- ative symptoms), individual supportive psychotherapy, and family therapy for relapse prevention.

KEY FACT

History/PE Symptoms (SIG E CAPS) last 2 or more weeks and must lead to significant dysfunction or impairment.

Untreated depression may worsen morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease and vice versa.

DiffErEntial ■ Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia): A milder (two symptoms of major depressive disorder [MDD]), chronically depressed state of 2 or more years’ duration.

MNEMONIC

Symptoms of depression—

■ Bereavement: Does not involve severe impairment, anhedonia, or suicid- ality; usually improves within 2 months (but can last up to 1 year). Symp- toms may vary with cultural norms. For example, visual and auditory hallucinations (eg, seeing or speaking with the deceased) are common and considered normal. Feelings of grief around anniversaries and other spe- cial events beyond the 1-year period are also common.

■ Adjustment disorder with depressed mood: Does not meet full criteria for a mood episode (eg, MDD); occurs within 3 months of a stressor and lasts < 6 months.

SIG E CAPS

Sleep (↓/↑) Interest (↓) Guilt Energy (↓) Concentration Appetite (↓/↑) Psychomotor agitation or retardation Suicidal ideation

■ Bipolar disorder: Patients can present with depression, so carefully screen for a history of a manic episode. Use caution with SSRIs, as they can pre- cipitate a manic episode.

■ Other mood disorder: Substance-induced (eg, illicit drugs, β-blockers, oral contraceptives) or due to a medical condition (eg, hypothyroidism, stroke); dementia.

Diagnosis Requires either or both depressed mood (irritability in children/adolescents) and anhedonia and at least five of the following symptoms during a 2-week period:

■ ■ Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt. ■ Fatigue or loss of energy. ■ ↓ Ability to concentrate or indecisiveness. ■ Significant weight loss or weight gain/change in appetite. ■ Psychomotor agitation or retardation. ■ Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

======================================
KEY FACT

Depression-related cognitive dysfunction “pseudodementia” may present similarly to dementia in older adults. Emphasizing one’s own failures, a lack of effort on cognitive testing, and significant subjective deficits incongruent with exam suggest depression.

trEatmEnt ■ Pharmacotherapy:

■ Most antidepressants have equal efficacy. ■

If there is co-occurring depression and insomnia, treating the depres- sion will often improve sleep.

■ SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine, paroxetine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (eg, venlafaxine), and bupropion are the main treat- ments; SSRIs are generally first line.

■ Generally takes 6 weeks for full effect; this is minimum for an “adequate trial” of an antidepressant.

■ Generally safe, but common side effects include GI upset, akathisia, sexual dysfunction (most common with SSRIs; add or use bupropion instead).

■ Abrupt discontinuation can lead to uncomfortable withdrawal symp- toms that resolve and are not life-threatening.

PSYCHIATRY

■ Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT):

■ ECT is safe and effective. It is best for psychotic or catatonic depres- sion but may also be used for acute mania or psychosis as well as for patients who refuse to eat or drink (eg, severely depressed elderly per- son) or are suicidal.

■ Side effects include postictal confusion, arrhythmias, headache, and retrograde amnesia (inability to recall memories before the event). ■ Relative contraindications include intracranial mass, aneurysm, and recent myocardial infarction/stroke. Pregnancy is not a contraindication. ■ Psychotherapy combined with antidepressants is more effective than either

modality alone.
======================================
B I P O L A R D I S O R D E R

Prevalence is 1–2%. A family history of bipolar illness significantly ↑ risk. The male-to-female ratio is 1:1. Symptoms usually appear around age 20. About 10–15% of those affected die by suicide.

History/PE ■ A manic episode is defined as follows:

■ One week of an abnormally and persistently elevated (“euphoric”), expansive, or irritable mood.

■ At least three of the symptoms (four if the mood is irritable) in the mnemonic DIGS FAR.

■ A mixed episode characterized by full manic or hypomanic criteria and

three major depressive symptoms. If psychotic features are present or hospitalization is required due to the severity of symptoms, the episode meets criteria for full mania.

■

DiffErEntial ■ Hypomania: Symptoms last for at least four days, do not cause the same degree of functional impairment of a manic episode (eg, do not usually require hospitalization).

■ Cyclothymic disorder: Periods of hypomanic symptoms over 2 or more years that never meet full criteria for hypomania/mania, and depressive symptoms that never meet criteria for a major depressive episode.

■ Other: Substance-induced mood disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, personality disorders, medical conditions (eg, temporal lobe epi- lepsy, hyperthyroidism), ADHD.

Diagnosis ■ Bipolar I disorder: Diagnosis made after just one manic episode. Depres-

sive episodes are common but are not required for diagnosis.

■ Bipolar II disorder: Characterized by at least one hypomanic (rather than manic) episode alternating with at least one major depressive episode.

trEatmEnt ■ Acute mania: Lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines,

ECT.

■ Bipolar depression: Mood stabilizers (lithium or lamotrigine are first line). Monotherapy with an antidepressant is not recommended. If the patient does not respond to first-line treatment, the next step may include adding lamotrigine (if started with lithium). In severe cases, con- sider ECT.

Anxiety Disorders
======================================
P H O B I A

Defined as persistent, excessive, or unreasonable fear and/or avoidance of an object or situation that leads to significant distress or impairment. The three categories of phobia are agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobia.

History/PE ■ Exposure to the object or stimulus may precipitate panic attacks. ■ Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is characterized by unreasonable, marked, and persistent fear of scrutiny and embarrassment in social or per- formance situations. It usually begins in adolescence.

■ Specific phobia is immediately cued by an object or a situation (eg, spi- ders, animals, heights). It usually begins in childhood.

Diagnosis ■ Symptom duration is 6 or more months for all ages. ■ As in OCD, symptoms interrupt the patient’s life, but patients no longer

must recognize that their fears are excessive.

trEatmEnt ■ Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy (eg, SSRIs,

benzodiazepines, β-blockers) are effective for social phobias.

■ Behavioral therapy that uses exposure and desensitization is best for spe- cific phobia.

PA N I C D I S O R D E R

More common in women, with a mean age of onset of 25. Often accompa- nied by agoraphobia, a fear of being in places or situations from which escape is difficult; of being outside the home alone; or of being in public places.

History/PE ■ Characterized by discrete periods of intense fear or discomfort. ■ Attacks are sometimes brought about by an identifiable trigger, but often not. ■ There is excessive worry about having recurrent panic attacks. ■ At least four of the symptoms in the PANICS mnemonic develop abruptly

and peak within 10 minutes (may also include depersonalization).

DiffErEntial Medical conditions (eg, angina, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia), substance- induced anxiety disorder, other anxiety disorders.

Diagnosis ■ Characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. ■ At least 1 month of worry about and/or behavioral change to avoid subse-

quent attacks.

events, leading to significant impairment or distress. ■ Patients may seek medical care for somatic complaints.

DiffErEntial Substance-induced anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition (eg, hyperthyroidism), other anxiety disorders (eg, panic disorder, social phobia).

Diagnosis Diagnostic criteria are as follows:

■ Anxiety/worry on most days for at least 6 months. ■ Three or more somatic symptoms, including restlessness, fatigue, difficulty

concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

trEatmEnt ■ Venlafaxine, SSRIs, benzodiazepines, and buspirone; second-line treat- ment with TCAs is appropriate if other antidepressants are ineffective or are not tolerated.

■ Benzodiazepines are useful for acute relief and as a bridge to long-term treatment with SSRIs.

■ Psychotherapy (eg, CBT) and relaxation training are important adjuncts.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
======================================
O B S E S S I V E - C O M P U L S I V E D I S O R D E R

Typically presents in late adolescence or early adulthood; it can lead to severe functional impairment.

History/PE ■ Obsessions are persistent, intrusive thoughts, impulses, or images that lead to anxiety/distress and interfere with daily life. Common themes are con- tamination and fear of harm to oneself or to others (eg, recurrent worry that you will harm someone close to you).

■ Compulsions are conscious, repetitive behaviors (eg, hand washing) or mental acts (eg, counting) that patients feel driven to perform to neutral- ize anxiety from obsessions.

Preoccupation with an imagined defect in appearance.

■ Hx/PE: Multiple visits to surgeons and dermatologists are common; cosmetic procedures and interventions almost never help. Associated with depression.

■ Tx: CBT and SSRIs.

H O A R D I N G

Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of actual value, to save the items and avoid distress associated with discarding them. The items cause clogging and congestion in main areas of the home. Hoard- ing with excessive acquisition affects 80% of cases.

■ Hx/PE: Hoarding behavior causes distress and impairment. ■ Tx: CBT and address comorbid diagnoses. Difficult to treat, with a low

response rate.

Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders
======================================
P O S T T R A U M AT I C S T R E S S D I S O R D E R

Results from exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury and evoked intense fear, helplessness, or horror.

History/PE ■ Examples of traumatic events include war, torture, natural disasters,

assault, rape, and serious accidents.

■ Patients may have experienced the trauma personally, or they may have witnessed the event in a way that leads them to feel personally threatened, helpless, and horrified (eg, a child witnessing a parent being assaulted).

■ Nightmares and flashbacks are common. ■ Watch for survival guilt, personality change, substance abuse, depression,

and suicide.

DiffErEntial ■ Acute stress disorder: Symptoms are like those of posttraumatic stress dis- order (PTSD) but last < 1 month and occur within 1 month of a trauma. ■ Adjustment disorder with anxiety: Emotional or behavioral symptoms

occurring within 3 months of a stressor and lasting < 6 months.

■ Other: Depression, OCD, acute intoxication or withdrawal, factitious dis- orders, malingering, borderline personality disorder.

■ Reexperiencing the event (eg, nightmares, flashbacks). ■ Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli or numbing of general responsiveness. ■ Hyperarousal (eg, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, irritability, difficulty

falling or staying asleep).

trEatmEnt ■ First line: SSRIs; if not tolerated or if ineffective, use TCAs or MAOIs. α2-Adrenergic agonists (prazosin, clonidine), or β-blockers (propranolol) may be helpful for some patients.

■ CBT, exposure therapy, and group therapy are also effective.
======================================
A D J U S T M E N T D I S O R D E R

The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor occurring within 3 months of the stressor.

■ Dx: Distress is out of proportion to the severity of the stressor. Symptoms do not meet the criteria for MDD or other disorders and resolve by 6 months once the stressor passes.

■ Tx: Supportive therapy, CBT, or medication management of distinct symptoms (eg, sleep aids for insomnia); if symptoms become more severe or meet the criteria for another mood or anxiety disorder, antidepressants or anxiolytics may be indicated.

Dissociative Disorders

D I S S O C I AT I V E I D E N T I T Y D I S O R D E R

Formerly known as multiple personality disorder.

■ Hx/PE: Patients present with two or more distinct personalities (aka “alters”). Often associated with severe and prolonged abuse and/or neglect in childhood. Comorbid PTSD is common.

D I S S O C I AT I V E A M N E S I A

Temporary amnesia for one’s own identity. It typically lasts hours to days. Like other dissociative disorders, it cannot be attributed to the ingestion of illicit substances or to other psychiatric conditions (eg, delirium).

■ Hx/PE: Usually precipitated by acute stressors. It can be accompanied by a fugue involving travel to a different city or state and having established a new identity. Upon recovery, the individual is amnestic to the fugue epi- sode as well as for the original stressor that caused it.

Somatic Symptoms and Related Disorders

The following disorders consist primarily of somatic symptoms without obvious medical diagnoses that cause significant impairment and distress. Because somatic symptom disorders often accompany medical diagnoses, a medical cause of symptoms must be ruled out before a diagnosis of somatic disorder is made.

■ Hx/PE: Symptoms are accompanied by disproportionate thoughts, feel- ings, or behaviors regarding symptoms. The patient’s suffering is authentic even if no medical cause is identified. It presents with predominant pain (formerly pain disorder)—pain intensity or a pain profile that is inconsis- tent with physiologic processes.

■ Tx: Psychotherapy and SSRIs for comorbid depression/anxiety. Provide consistent follow-up with the primary care physician and/or psychiatric providers. Minimize unnecessary interventions.
======================================
I L L N E S S A N X I E T Y D I S O R D E R

Preoccupation for > 6 months with fear of having a serious disease based on misinterpretation of symptoms (rather than delusions). Formerly known as hypochondriasis.

■ Hx/PE: Symptoms are exacerbated by or related to psychological factors, especially depression.

■ Tx: Physical therapy, psychotherapy, and antidepressants. Analgesics rarely provide relief.

C O N V E R S I O N D I S O R D E R

Characterized by alterations in voluntary motor or sensory function.

■ Hx/PE: Symptoms are not volitionally produced and cannot be explained by a known organic etiology. Relation to a stressful event suggests associa- tion with psychological factors (eg, a mother who has paralysis of the right arm after hitting her child).

■ Tx: Provide reassurance, psychotherapy, and close monitoring and follow- up. Symptoms usually subside spontaneously.

FA C T I T I O U S D I S O R D E R

Falsification of physical or psychological symptoms, or inducing injury or ill- ness (eg, a patient who injects himself with insulin) that is associated with identified deception. It is more common among health care workers than in the general population.

■ Hx/PE: Symptoms are consciously produced, but the reason may be unconscious (eg, wanting to assume the sick role or be taken care of) and can be produced on oneself or on others (eg, a mother who gives her child nuts to induce anaphylactic shock).

■ Tx: Provide therapy to resolve underlying issues; medication for comorbid diagnoses.

Females account for 90% of cases. Peak incidence is at age 14 and age 18. Risk factors include a ⊕ family history, higher socioeconomic status, poor self-esteem, psychiatric comorbidities (eg, major depression, OCD, anxiety), and body-conscious careers/activities such as modeling, ballet, and wrestling. Mortality from suicide or medical complications is 10%.

■ ■ Distorted body image.

Diagnosis ■ Measure height and weight. Check CBC, electrolytes (including phos-

phate and magnesium), TSH/FT4, and an ECG.

■ Look for lanugo (fine body hair), dry skin, lethargy, bradycardia, hypoten- sion, and peripheral edema.

trEatmEnt ■ Hospitalize if there is concern for refeeding syndrome, significant ortho-

stasis, bradycardia, or electrolyte abnormalities.

■ Patients often deny the health risks of their behavior. Monitor caloric intake and focus on slow weight gain. Individual, family, and group psy- chotherapy is crucial.

■ Pharmacotherapy is generally not helpful, although SSRIs (fluoxetine) and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine) have been used with limited success.

■ Avoid bupropion, considering the risk of seizure.

Affects 1–3% of young women. The prognosis is more favorable than that of anorexia nervosa. It is associated with an ↑ frequency of affective disorders, substance abuse, and borderline personality disorder.

History/PE Patients have normal weight or are overweight but engage in the following behaviors at least once a week for 3 or more months:

■ Binge eating with a sense of lack of self-control. ■ Compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain (eg, self-induced vomit-

ing, laxatives, diuretics, overexercise).

Occurs in normal-weight/overweight or obese individuals. It begins in adoles- cence or young adulthood and is common in those who are college-age.

DiffErEntial ■ Anorexia, binge-purge type: Differentiated by weight; patients are under- weight in anorexia but are of normal weight or overweight in binge eating. ■ Bulimia nervosa: Patients with binge-eating disorder do not have compen-

satory behaviors such as purging, as seen in bulimia nervosa.

■ Patients who seek treatment are usually older than those with anorexia or bulimia.

Diagnosis ■ Recurrent episodes of binge eating: Episodes are characterized by eating, in a discrete period, more than most people would eat in similar situation, with a sense of lack of control over eating.

■ Binge eating is associated with three (or more) of the following: Eating more rapidly than normal; eating until feeling uncomfortably full; eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating; feeling dis- gusted with oneself, depressed, or guilty afterward.

Elimination Disorders  E N U R E S I S 

Not a clinical disorder until > 5 years of age as the child may not feel/under- stand neurologic impulses until then. Primary enuresis is when a child has never achieved continence. Secondary enuresis is when a child achieves night- time continence for 6 months but then begins bedwetting again. Primary noc- turnal enuresis often resolves spontaneously and does not require treatment.

■ Tx: If necessary, treat initially with behavioral therapy (eg, bed alarms); des- mopressin acetate or imipramine should be reserved for refractory cases.

Defined as significant difficulty falling or staying asleep. It can have early- morning awakening and is associated with nonrestorative sleep.

■ Hx/PE: The disorder cannot be attributed to physical or mental condi- tions but is often precipitated by anxiety. Symptoms occur three or more times a week for at least 3 months.

■ Tx: CBT is the treatment of choice with best efficacy and durability, par- ticularly in frail or elderly patients who may have side effects from seda- tives. Sleep hygiene, hypnotics.

Usually presents before age 30. It may be familial and is often associated with mood disorders, substance abuse, and GAD.

■ Hx/PE: Presents with excessive daytime sleepiness and daytime sleep attacks characterized by ↓ rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency. Symptoms occur at least three times per month for 3 or more months. It may involve hypnagogic (just before sleep) or hypnopompic (just before awakening) hallucinations and hypocretin deficiency, as measured by cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

■ Tx: First-line therapy is nonamphetamine stimulants (modafinil). Amphet- amine stimulants (methylphenidate) can be added if needed.

Non-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders ■ Sleepwalking: Repeated episodes of rising from bed during sleep and

walking about. Not responsive to efforts of others to communicate.

■ Sleep terrors: Abrupt terror arousals from sleep, often starting with a pan- icky scream. The individual cannot be comforted by others. Resolve spon- taneously in most cases.

REM Sleep Disorders ■ Nightmare disorder: Repeated occurrence of extended, frightening, and well-remembered dreams. If comorbid with PTSD, treat with α-blockers. Systematic desensitization and relaxation may be helpful.

■ REM sleep behavior disorder: Acting out dreams—arousal from sleep with vocalizations and complex motor behaviors, such as running, kicking, and punching. It can cause injury to the bed partner. Neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson’s develops in 50% of affected persons. Treat with clonazepam and melatonin.

Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders

■ Oppositional defiant disorder: Angry, irritable mood with hostile and defiant attitude toward authority figures of ≥ 6 months’ duration. Patients easily lose their temper and are vindictive. May lead to conduct disorder. The most effective treatments are parent management training, family therapy, and CBT.

■ Conduct disorder: A disorder in which a patient repeatedly and signifi- cantly violates societal norms and the rights of others (eg, bullies, tortures animals, steals/destroys property) for 1 or more years. Treatment usually involves behavioral therapy. It is considered a precursor to antisocial per- sonality disorder.

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

S U B S TA N C E U S E D I S O R D E R

The lifetime prevalence of using one or more illicit substances in the United States is roughly 40%. Comorbid psychiatric disorders are common.

History/PE The signs, symptoms, and physical findings of acute intoxication and with- drawal are outlined in Table 17-2.

Diagnosis ■ Check urine and serum toxicology. Offer human immunodeficiency virus

(HIV) testing; check LFTs and consider hepatitis testing.

■ Patients display loss of control over substance use, continued use despite knowledge of harm, and accumulating consequences from use (eg, arrest, job loss). These lead to clinically significant impairment and, in general, to an overall worsening of the situation.

trEatmEnt ■ Group therapy, 12-step programs, recovery housing. Hospitalization may be necessary for acute withdrawal. Provide methadone or buprenorphine maintenance for opiate use disorder.

■ Treatment for tobacco use disorder includes counseling/physician advice, nicotine replacement, and bupropion or varenicline.

O P I AT E U S E D I S O R D E R

Epidemic. Dangerous co-ingestions (benzodiazepines, alcohol, other CNS depressants) and potent formulations (eg, fentanyl) have contributed to over- dose deaths.

■ Tx: Replacement opiate agonist therapy is the gold standard for treatment (methadone or buprenorphine). Check QTc if treating with methadone. Treat acute symptoms of withdrawal with clonidine (α2-antagonist), low dose benzodiazepines, comfort medications (treat GI distress, aches and pains, insomnia).

Infectious (encephalitis, meningitis, UTI) Withdrawal (alcohol, benzodiazepines) Acute metabolic disorder (electrolyte imbalance) Trauma (head injury, postoperative) CNS pathology (stroke, hemorrhage, tumor) Hypoxia (anemia, cardiac failure) Deficiencies (vitamin B12, folic acid, thiamine) Endocrinopathies (thyroid, glucose) Acute vascular (shock, vasculitis, hypertension) Toxins, substance use, medications Heavy metals (arsenic, lead, mercury)

DiffErEntial In contrast to delirium, dementia usually has an insidious onset; it includes chronic memory and executive function deficits and is characterized by symp- toms that tend not to fluctuate during the day (see Table 17-3).
======================================
Diagnosis ■ Evaluate for recent medication changes, hypoglycemia, hepatic encepha-

lopathy, or UTI.

■ Workup may include a CBC, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/ creatinine, glucose, LFTs, UA, urine toxicology, vitamin B12/folate, TSH, VDRL, HIV, blood culture, serum calcium/phosphorus/magnesium, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas (ABGs), CSF, or serum drug screening.

■ The mnemonic I WATCH DEATH lists common etiologies of delirium.

trEatmEnt ■ Treat the underlying medical condition. ■ Minimize or discontinue delirium-inducing drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics) and simplify medication regimens if possible. Provide reorientation techniques (eg, clocks or wall calendars) and an environ- ment that will facilitate healthy sleep/wake cycles.

■ Pharmacotherapy may be beneficial and includes low-dose antipsychotics (haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine), usually for short-term use. Physical restraints may be necessary to prevent physical harm to self/ others.

Personality Disorders

Defined as enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate from cultural standards. They are pervasive and inflexible; begin in adoles- cence or early adulthood; are stable and predictable over time; and they lead to distress or impairment (see Table 17-4). In some cases (eg, OCPD), how- ever, personality disorders are more noticeable and bothersome to others than the person affected. Treat with psychotherapy. Pharmacotherapy is generally used only if psychiatric comorbidities exist.

Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States. Protective factors include religious affiliation, social support, and responsibility to chil- dren. Risk factors include the following:

■ Gender: Men complete suicide three times more often than do women, whereas women attempt suicide three times more frequently. Men tend to use violent methods (eg, hanging, firearms).

■ Age: Those > 75 years of age account for 25% of completed suicides. Sui- cide is also the third leading cause of death in 15- to 24-year-olds, after homicides and accidents.

5B

KEY FACT

■ Ethnicity: Two thirds of completed suicides are done by Caucasian men. ■ Psychiatric illness: MDD, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, substance

abuse or dependence.

In a suicide risk assessment, access to firearms should always be assessed and is a risk factor for completed suicide.

■ Other risk factors: Divorced or separated, recent stressors, unskilled/low education status, unemployment or job dissatisfaction; chronic, debilitat- ing illness, substance use, hopelessness, impulsivity; a history of prior sui- cide attempts; and a family history of suicide.

5

KEY FACT

Although obstructive in nature, asthma is a reversible condition. It usually has a normal DLco because the alveoli are unaffected. By contrast, COPD is characterized by a ↓ DLco because some alveoli are destroyed and unavailable for gas exchange.

Pulmonary Function Testing

The measurements most often used in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon mon- oxide (DLco) (see Figure 18-1). Three major patterns of pulmonary diseases can be identified in PFTs: obstructive, restrictive, and normal.

■ Obstructive pattern (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic bronchitis, and bronchiectasis): In all cases of obstruc- tion, there will be a reduction in expiratory flow as noted on the spiro- gram. The FEV1 will be reduced. However, this value might also be reduced in restrictive lung disease. Markers for airway obstruction include: ■ An FEV1/FVC ratio of < 0.8 predicted for age and gender. Severe

An FEV,/FVC ratio of < 0.8 predicted for age and gender. Severe obstruction is designated by an FEV,/FVC ratio of < 0.5.

obstruction is designated by an FEV1/FVC ratio of < 0.5. ■ An ↑ in the residual volume (RV), referred to as air trapping. ■ With more severe obstruction, increases in functional residual capacity

(FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) can also be seen.

■ Restrictive pattern (obesity, kyphosis, inflammatory/fibrosing lung disease,

interstitial lung disease): ■ The defining factor for restrictive lung disease is ↓ TLC. TLC, RV, vital capacity (VC), and FRC all tend to be reduced, though not in all cases.

■ Measurements of expiratory flow tend to be preserved, including the FEV1/FVC.

■ Restrictive processes that are parenchymal in origin tend to also decrease the DLco, whereas processes external to the lung usually have a preserved DLco.

■ Although FEV1 and FVC are low, the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal or ↑. ■ An FVC of < 80% is suggestive of restriction when the FEV1/FVC

ratio is normal.

Asthma

An obstructive disease characterized by intermittent airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. Asthma is one of three most common causes of chronic cough along with postnasal drainage and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

History/PE ■ Presents with intermittent wheezing, most commonly expiratory. ■ Symptoms may be seasonal, follow exposure to triggers (eg, upper respira-

tory infections, dust, pet dander, cold air), or occur with exercise.

■ Cough-variant asthma is triggered by exercise, cold, or forced exhalation. ■ Acute asthma exacerbations:

■ During attacks, patients classically demonstrate a prolonged expiratory phase that is sometimes accompanied by wheezing or cough.

■ Determine severity by assessing mental status, the ability to speak in full sentences, use of accessory muscles, and vital signs. A normal or ↓ respiratory rate suggests respiratory fatigue.

■ Patients with severe exacerbations may have ↓ wheezing and may need prompt assessment of their gas exchange (with arterial blood gas [ABG] analysis) along with aggressive treatment, but don’t let this delay care!

■ Chronic intermittent asthma: Exam may be normal if the patient is not having an exacerbation.

tion or irritation, and heart failure (HF). In patients with chronic cough, think about asthma as well as allergic rhi- nitis, postnasal drip, or GERD.

Diagnosis ■ Definitive diagnosis is made with an obstructive pattern on PFTs sup- ported by reversibility with bronchodilators, as demonstrated by an 12% ↑ in FEV1 and/or FVC and ≥ 0.20 L. If PFTs are normal but suspicion for asthma remains high, a methacho- line challenge can be used to provoke symptoms in a monitored setting, or an exhaled nitric oxide level can be measured; a level > 50 ppb (> 35 ppb in children) may be used to indicate that eosinophilic inflammation and, in symptomatic patients, responsiveness to corticosteroids are likely.

■

■ CXR is usually normal but can exclude other causes.

therapy (nebulizer or MDI): β-Agonists activate β2 receptors, leading to smooth muscle relaxation of the bronchial passages and thus dilation of the airways.

■ Systemic corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone or prednisone + inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

■ A single 2-g dose of magnesium sulfate can be administered intrave- nously in severe exacerbations.

■ Follow patients closely with peak flows and tailor therapy to the response. A peak flow that is < 50% of baseline flow suggests a medical emergency. Consider noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation or intubation if neces- sary (but try to avoid intubation at all costs).

■ Antibiotics (in the absence of infection), anticholinergics, cromolyn sodium, and leukotriene antagonists are generally of no utility.

pursed-lip breathing, barrel chest, rhonchi, or wheezing. ■ Hypercarbia/hypoxia and weight loss are seen in later stages. ■ Patients may show evidence of cor pulmonale (right HF from pulmonary

hypertension).

Diagnosis ■ The post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is < 0.7 and FEV1 < 80% of pre-

dicted. TLC is usually ↑.

■ The condition is not fully reversible with bronchodilators. ■ DLco tends to be ↓. ■ CXR may show hyperlucent, hyperinflated lungs with flattened dia-

phragms (see Figure 18-2).

trEatmEnt ■ Stable COPD management:

■ LABAs and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (eg, ipratropium) are preferred over short-acting agents except for patients with only occa- sional dyspnea.

■ Patients may be started on single LABA or dual long-acting bronchodi- lator therapy.

■ Theophylline is not recommended unless other long-term treatment bronchodilators are unavailable or unaffordable.

■ Long-term monotherapy with ICS is not recommended, nor is long- term treatment with oral corticosteroids.

■ O2 therapy is indicated for patients with an SaO2 < 88%, a partial pres- sure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of < 55 mm Hg, or a PaO2 of 55–60 mm Hg with right HF or erythrocytosis. Titrate O2 to keep SaO2 > 90%.

Influenza vaccination is recommended for all patients with COPD. ■ ■ Pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13 and PPSV23) is recommended for all patients > 65 years of age and in younger patients with significant comorbid conditions including chronic heart or lung disease.

■ Lung volume reduction surgery should be considered in selected patients with upper lobe emphysema.

■ Acute COPD exacerbations: Defined as ↑ dyspnea, a change in cough or

sputum production or increased oxygen requirements from baseline. ■ Check a CXR to look for causes of the exacerbation (eg, pneumonia,

HF).

■ Hypoventilation leading to acute hypercarbia (an ↑ in PCO2) may necessitate noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or mechanical ventilation.

■ Administer O2 to maintain a SaO2 90–95%. ■ Administer short-acting β-agonists with or without short-acting anticho-

linergics (eg, ipratropium).

■ Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1) and oxygen- ation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration. Duration of therapy should not be more than 5–7 days for routine cases.

■ Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration. They should cover Streptococcus, H influenzae, and Moraxella, and duration of ther- apy should be 5–7 days. Appropriate options include any broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, azithromycin, clindamycin, a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a third-generation cephalosporin).

======================================
Hypoxia and Hypoxemia

Hypoxia is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate O2 supply at the tissue level. Hypoxemia is ↓ PaO2. Both condi- tions can be caused by multiple processes, outlined below.

Diagnosis Determine the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient, calculated as PAO2 – PaO2.

■ Normal gradient (5–10 mm Hg): Consider a low FiO2 state or high alti- tude. Corrects with supplemental O2.

■ Increased gradient:

■ Shunt physiology: Does not correct with supplemental O2. Causes may be pulmonary processes (alveolar collapse [atelectasis], lobar pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) or extrapul- monary processes (patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale). ■ Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch: Corrects with supplemental O2. Causes include asthma, COPD, pneumonia, interstitial lung dis- ease, and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Hypoxia can also be accompanied by hypercarbia (↑ PaCO2). Causes include: ■ Hypoventilation from neuromuscular disorder or CNS disorder (opi-

ates, stroke, central sleep apnea).

■ COPD or obstructive lung disease (generally ↑ A-a gradient).

trEatmEnt Always treat hypoxic patients with adequate amounts of O2 to maintain satura- tions of > 90% or a PaO2 of > 60 mm Hg.

Fluid is exudative if one of the following Light criteria is present (see Table 18-3): ■ Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio > 0.5. ■ Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio > 0.6. ■ Pleural fluid LDH level > 2/3 the upper limit of the laboratory’s refer-

ence range of serum LDH.

■ Cell count with differential, Gram stain and culture, and glucose: pH may be a helpful adjunct if you are concerned about infectious or rheu- matologic etiology. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) may be helpful if suspecting TB. Triglycerides may be helpful if suspecting a thoracic duct injury.

trEatmEnt ■ Thoracentesis for an effusion > 10 mm thickness on lateral decubitus

Thoracentesis for an effusion > 10 mm thickness on lateral decubitus CXR may be both therapeutic and diagnostic.

CXR may be both therapeutic and diagnostic. ■

If the fluid is transudative, focus on treating the underlying cause (ven- triculoperitoneal shunt, HF, hypoalbuminemia, hepatic hydrothorax, nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal dialysis, urinothorax, atelectasis). If the fluid is exudative, refer to Table 18-4 to help determine the cause.

======================================
■ Thoracostomy tube indications: Empyema, hemothorax, malignant effu- sion, recurrent effusion, chylothorax, pneumothorax, hemopneumothorax.

ComPliCations ■ An untreated pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia may become

infected and turn into an empyema.

■ Over time, exudative effusions may become loculated and require drain- age by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) or surgical decortication.

■ Complications of thoracentesis include pneumothorax and bleeding (remember, the neurovascular bundle runs along the inferior side of the rib). Use ultrasound during the procedure to minimize the risk of pneu- mothorax and obtain a CXR afterward.

Pneumothorax

Abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall.

History/PE ■ May present with acute shortness of breath with or without pleuritic chest

pain.

■ Exam reveals tachypnea, ↓ tactile fremitus, ↓ breath sounds, tympany on percussion on the affected side, and tracheal deviation toward the opposite side (if tension pneumothorax).

a .\

This patient has an exudative pleural effusion with suspected TB. He will need a pleural biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of TB despite having a ⊝ sputum culture.

Diagnosis ■ The main feature on CXR is a white visceral pleural line, which is sepa- rated from the parietal pleura by a collection of gas. In most cases, no pulmonary vessels are visible beyond the visceral pleural line (see Fig- ure 18-4).

■ Tracheal deviation away from the side of the pneumothorax suggests ten- sion pneumothorax (see below).

trEatmEnt ■ Minimal pneumothorax (< 15–20% by Light Index; 2–3 cm from apex to cupola by alternate criteria): Simple observation is appropriate for asymp- tomatic patients with close follow-up to ensure no enlargement.

■ Needle aspiration is safe and effective. ■ Large pneumothorax (eg, mediastinal shift, cardiovascular collapse): Tube

thoracostomy should be performed in any symptomatic patient.

■ First-time 2° spontaneous pneumothorax (COPD, trauma): Typically requires the approach above for minimal or large.
======================================
T E N S I O N P N E U M O T H O R A X

■ Occurs when air enters the pleural cavity and is trapped during expiration. The intrathoracic pressure compresses the lung and displaces the mediasti- num and its structures toward the opposite side, causing cardiopulmonary impairment.

■ Dx: Look for a pneumothorax along with tachycardia, hypotension, ↑ O2 requirements, and ↑ jugular venous pressure (JVP). The trachea deviates away from the side with tension.

■ Tx: If you suspect that the patient has a tension pneumothorax, don’t wait for imaging! Insert a large-bore needle with a syringe superior to the sec- ond or third rib at the midclavicular line on the side of ↓ breath sounds. Be sure to leave the needle or catheter in the pleural space while placing the chest tube or tension may recur.

Pulmonary Embolism

The factors that contribute to the formation of thrombi are remembered with the Virchow triad:

■ Stasis: Immobility, HF, obesity, ↑ JVP. ■ Endothelial injury: Trauma, surgery, recent fracture, prior deep venous

thrombosis (DVT).

■ Hypercoagulable state: Pregnancy, oral contraceptive pill use, coagula- tion disorders, malignancy, burns.

History/PE ■ Chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope. ■ Patients may have hemoptysis or a low-grade fever. ■ Consider PE in patients who have risk factors for DVT/PE or leg pain and

swelling.

■ Exam shows tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, a loud P2 or S2, ↑ JVP, and signs of right HF.
======================================
DiffErEntial Acute MI, pneumonia, pneumothorax, HF, aortic dissection.

Diagnosis Initial assessment should include the following (see Figure 18-5):

■ ABGs: May show a 1° respiratory alkalosis and an ↑ A-a gradient. ■ CXR: Usually normal but may show atelectasis or the following:

■ A wedge-shaped infarct (Hampton hump). ■ Oligemia in the affected lobe (Westermark sign). ■ Pleural effusion.

■ ECG: Most commonly demonstrates sinus tachycardia. The S1Q3T3 pat- tern of an S wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead III, and T-wave inversion in lead III may also be present, but this is neither sensitive nor specific.

■ Chest CT with contrast: Has largely replaced V/Q scanning as the 1° diag- nostic modality unless it is contraindicated by renal insufficiency (chronic kidney disease, not end stage renal disease), pregnancy, or contrast allergy. It will show filling defects in the affected vasculature (see Figure 18-6). ■ Pulmonary angiography: Rarely necessary but can be considered and may

be needed if other testing is intermediate.

trEatmEnt ■ ABCs are #1! Resuscitation should begin with stabilization and oxygenation. ■ Treat venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients with anticoagulation to prevent recurrent VTE. Without anticoagulation, the risk of recurrent PE is 25%. Initially use IV heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. Patients who are not adequately anticoagulated within 24 hours have a high rate of recurrence.

■ Patients can then be transitioned to warfarin therapy (with a goal INR of

2.0–3.0) or a novel anticoagulant (eg, apixaban or rivaroxaban). In patients with PE and hypotension or shock, consider administering tis- sue plasminogen activator (tPA) along with heparin. The duration of anti- coagulation therapy will vary with risk factors.

■ For patients with a first event and reversible or time-limited risk factors (eg, surgery, pregnancy), treat for at least 3–6 months.

■ Consider lifelong anticoagulation in patients with chronic risk factors (eg, malignancy, paraplegia, genes for hypercoagulable conditions, recurrent DVTs, PEs). If contraindication to anticoagulation exists, or if the patient develops another thrombus while on anticoagulation, an IVC filter should be con- sidered. Although these filters can ↓ the risk of PE, they are associated with a higher risk of recurrent DVT.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

Characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, resulting in bilateral, diffuse alveolar damage and hypoxia. It can be caused by a range of pulmo- nary and nonpulmonary conditions, including:

■ Sepsis. ■ Aspiration (usually massive aspiration of gastric contents). ■ Pneumonia. ■ Trauma (particularly trauma to the chest or massive tissue injury). ■ Transfusion-related lung injury. ■ Pancreatitis.

History/PE Look for a patient with risk factors, usually in an ICU setting. Patients will have acute onset of hypoxia along with diffuse rales on exam and will be difficult to oxygenate. Intubation is usually required to maintain an accept- able PaO2.

Diagnosis ■ The Berlin definition of ARDS: Onset within 1 week of clinical insult or worsening of respiratory symptoms; radiographic changes (bilateral opaci- ties not fully explained by effusions, consolidation, or atelectasis; see Fig- ure 18-7); origin of edema not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload; and severity based on the PaO2/FiO2 ratio on 5 cm of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

■ The 3 categories of ARDS are: ■ Mild (PaO2/FiO2 200–300). ■ Moderate (PaO2/FiO2 100–200). ■ Severe (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100).

trEatmEnt ■ Patients typically require intubation and mechanical ventilation for the

management of hypoxia.

■ Low tidal volumes (4–6 mL/kg) and associated permissive hypercapnia may improve the risk of barotrauma.

■ Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves oxygenation and thus ↓ the FiO2 requirement and associated O2 toxicity.

■ Look for the underlying cause and focus treatment on that as you stabi- lize the patient and treat hypoxia.

Solitary Pulmonary Nodule

Defined as a radiodense lesion seen on chest imaging that is < 3 cm in diam- eter and is not associated with infiltrates, adenopathy, or atelectasis.

History/PE Most solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) are detected on routine CXR in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. Nonmalignant and malignant lesions can be distinguished as follows:

■ Nonmalignant lesions (eg, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, TB,

hamartoma): ■ No growth on serial imaging 2 years apart. ■ A diffuse, dense and central, popcorn-like, or concentric “target” calci-

■ Occurrence in patients who are lifelong nonsmokers, are < 30 years of

age, and have no history of malignancy. ■ Malignant lesions (ie, lung cancer or metastases):

■ Size > 2 cm. ■ Spiculation (ie, ragged edges). ■ Sunburst pattern. ■ Upper lobe location. ■ Occurrence in patients who are smokers, are > 40 years of age, or have

a prior diagnosis of cancer.

Diagnosis/trEatmEnt ■ Start by examining old radiographs to determine age and change in size. Lesions with > 1 malignant feature should be further evaluated with CT imaging. If imaging points to a malignancy, biopsy should be performed via bron- choscopy, needle aspiration, or VATS. If the probability of malignancy is low, evaluate with serial CXRs or CTs every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.

■ For patients who lack previous imaging, follow the Fleischner Society guidelines (see Table 18-5).

Sarcoidosis

Sarcoidosis

An idiopathic illness characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulo- mas in various organs. Most patients have pulmonary involvement.

History/PE Sarcoidosis is a very heterogeneous disease, both in terms of presentation and severity. Common features include fever, cough, malaise, weight loss, dys- pnea, and arthritis, particularly of the knees and ankles.

DiffErEntial Sarcoidosis is a diagnosis of exclusion, so be sure to rule out other diseases that present similarly, such as TB, lymphoma, fungal infection, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, HIV, and berylliosis.

■ OSA: Upper airway collapse during sleep (↓ airflow but normal effort). ■ CSA: Diminished central ventilatory drive (↓ airflow and effort); may be

1° (idiopathic) or 2° (stroke, HF, CNS depressants).

History/PE ■ Presents with neurocognitive impairment, morning headache, poor sleep,

or impotence.

■ With OSA, the patient may report snoring, choking, or gasping during sleep.

■ Patients with OSA are typically obese and hypertensive. They may also have a large neck circumference. Look for micrognathia/retrognathia, a large tongue, or large tonsils.

Diagnosis The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) defines OSA as a polysomnography-determined obstructive respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥ 5 events/hour associated with the typical symptoms of OSA (eg, unrefresh- ing sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue or insomnia, awakening with a gasping or choking sensation, loud snoring, or witnessed apneas), or an obstructive RDI ≥ 15 events/hour (even in the absence of symptoms).

DiffErEntial Rule out other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness, including obesity hypoventilation syndrome, narcolepsy, and restless leg syndrome.

trEatmEnt ■ The most effective treatment for both CSA and OSA is CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation to keep the airways open during sleep. ■ For OSA, other treatment options include weight loss, oral appliances to relieve the obstruction, and surgery such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (effective in 40–50% of cases).

■ For CSA, treat the underlying condition whenever possible (eg, HF, exces- sive opiates).

ComPliCations Patients with OSA are at ↑ risk of hypertension, left ventricle dysfunction, car- diac dysrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and insulin resistance.

present.

■ Hyperinflation is seen early and is followed by peribronchial cuffing, mucous plugging, and bronchiectasis (see Figure 18-9).

Diagnosis ■ Sweat chloride test of ≥ 60 mEq/L (must be confirmed on two different

■ Genetic testing can confirm the presence of many of the genetic muta- tions (∆F508 is the most common genetic mutation).

trEatmEnt ■ Pulmonary symptoms are treated with chest physiotherapy, bronchodila-

tors, and mucolytics (DNase).

■ Patients need supplemental pancreatic enzymes, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) to address fat malabsorption, and stool softeners (fiber).

■ Long-term and long-term intermittent oral antibiotics (azithromycin) or inhaled antibiotics (tobramycin) may also be beneficial. Pseudomonas aeru- ginosa is common; therapies are tailored to treat the infecting organism. In severe end-stage pulmonary disease, bilateral lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment.

swelling), and postnasal drip. Induced by environmental allergens such as pollens, animal dander, dust mites, and mold spores. May be seasonal.

■

■ Exam reveals edematous, pale mucosa; cobblestoning in the pharynx; scleral injection; and blue, boggy turbinates.

Diagnosis ■ By clinical exam. ■ Skin-prick testing to a standard panel of antigens can be performed. ■ Blood testing for specific IgE antibodies via radioallergosorbent testing.

trEatmEnt ■ Allergen avoidance: Use dust mite–proof covers on bedding and remove

carpeting. Keep the home dry and avoid pets.

■ Medications:

■ Intermittent symptoms: Oral or intranasal antihistamines (diphen- hydramine, fexofenadine, olopatadine) block the effects of histamine released by mast cells. Selective antihistamines such as fexofenadine may cause less drowsiness than nonselective agents such as diphen- hydramine. Decongestants (pseudoephedrine) have α-adrenergic ago- nist effects and result in vasoconstriction.

■ Chronic symptoms: Intranasal corticosteroids, nasal saline rinses. ■ Severe acute symptoms: Intranasal antihistamine sprays, intranasal cromolyn, intranasal anticholinergic sprays (ipratropium), and short courses of oral corticosteroids.

■ Severe chronic symptoms: Immunotherapy (“allergy shots”)—slow to take effect, but useful for difficult-to-control symptoms. Sublingual immunotherapy for house dust mite or grass pollen. First dose must be given in the presence of a physician to monitor signs of severe systemic or local allergic reaction.

DiffErEntial Seborrheic dermatitis, contact/irritant dermatitis, impetigo.

Diagnosis Clinical.

trEatmEnt ■ First line is preventative therapy: Keep skin moisturized with topical emollients. Avoid hot water, dry environments, harsh soaps, fragranced products. Topical steroids only for flares.

■ First-line steroid-sparing agents: Topical tacrolimus/pimecrolimus (useful in areas where steroids are contraindicated, such as eyelids/groin).

■ Oral antihistamines to treat itch and antibiotics to treat superimposed impetigo.

C O N TA C T D E R M AT I T I S

Caused by exposure to allergens in the environment; may lead to acute, sub- acute, or chronic eczematous inflammation.

■ Irritant contact dermatitis: Non–immune-mediated irritation caused by a substance; no clear borders.

■ Allergic contact dermatitis: Immune-mediated Type IV hypersensitivity; usually occurs as a demarcated rash.

History/PE ■ Patients complain of itching, burning, and pruritus. ■ Acute: Presents with papular erythematous lesions and sometimes with vesicles, weeping erosions where vesicles have ruptured, crusting, and excoriations. The pattern of lesions often reflects the mechanism of expo- sure (see Figure 2-5).

Diagnosis ■ Clinically diagnosed in the setting of a possible exposure. ■ Patch testing can be used to elicit the reaction with the agent that caused

the dermatitis.

■ Consider the occupation and hobbies of the individual in relation to expo- sure site to determine whether they suggest a diagnosis.

trEatmEnt ■ Prevention: Avoid causative agents. ■ Mild: Cold compresses and oatmeal baths help soothe the area +/− topi-

cal steroids.

■ Severe: A short course of oral steroids if a large region of the body is involved.

P S O R I A S I S

An immune-mediated skin disease. Often chronic with a probable genetic predisposition.

History/PE Presents with well-demarcated pink plaques with silvery scale on the knees, elbows, gluteal cleft, and scalp (see Figure 2-6). Nails may show pitting and onycholysis.

trEatmEnt ■ Limited disease: Topical steroids, topical vitamin D analogs, topical

retinoids.

■ Generalized disease (involving > 30% of the body): UVB light exposure; PUVA (psoralen and UVA) if UVB is not effective.

Most common among people with fair skin, light hair or eyes, and those who have frequent flushing.

History/PE ■ Presents with erythema and with inflammatory papules that mimic acne

and appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin.

■ Open and closed comedones (whiteheads and blackheads) are not present.

■ Recurrent flushing may be elicited by spicy foods, alcohol, or emotional reactions.

■ Rhinophyma (an enlarged nose with an irregular texture) occurs late in the disease course and results from sebaceous gland hyperplasia (see Figure 2-8).

■ Patients may have ocular symptoms such as blepharitis, dry eyes, conjunc- tival injection, and lid margin telangiectasias.

DiffErEntial The absence of comedones and the patient’s age (older in rosacea versus younger in acne) help distinguish rosacea from acne vulgaris.

trEatmEnt ■ Initial therapy: The goal is to control rather than cure the chronic disease. Use mild cleansers, azelaic acid, and/or metronidazole topical gel +/− oral antibiotics as initial therapy.

■ Persistent symptoms: Treat with oral antibiotics (doxycycline, minocy- cline) and tretinoin cream.

■ Maintenance therapy:

■ First line: Topical metronidazole. ■ Clonidine or α-blockers may be effective in the management of flush-

ing, and patients should avoid triggers.

■ Consider referral for surgical evaluation if rhinophyma is present and is not responding to treatment.

■ Any patient with ocular symptoms (eg, grittiness, dryness) should be started on oral or topical local antibiotics and ocular lubricants.

■ Hx/PE: Look for nevi with an irregular appearance (ABCDE = Asymme- try, Border irregularity, Color irregularity, Diameter > 6 mm, Evolution). ■ Dx: Skin biopsy (melanocytes with cellular atypia); imaging may be war-

ranted for metastatic evaluation.

Genitourinary Disorders

E R E C T I L E D Y S F U N C T I O N

Inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for penetration and ejaculation. Associated with increasing age. Etiologies are as follows:

■ Psychological:

■ Symptoms often have a sudden onset. ■ Patients are unable to sustain or sometimes even obtain an erection. ■ Patients have normal nocturnal penile tumescence (those with organic

causes do not).

Ae

■ Organic:

■ Endocrine: DM, hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis, pituitary or gonadal disorders, ↑ prolactin.

Although a clinical exam is typically sufficient for the diagnosis of herpes zoster, a PCR of fluid from the lesion can be confirmatory. NSAIDs may be useful for pain control, and antiviral therapy may speed resolution and ↓ the likelihood of postherpetic neuralgia.

■ Vascular: Atherosclerosis, vascular steal. ■ Neurologic: Stroke, DM, multiple sclerosis, spinal surgery, neuropathy. ■ Exogenous: β-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake

inhibitors, α-blockers, clonidine, CNS depressants, anticholinergics, chronic opioids, tricyclic antidepressants.

AMBULATORY MEDICINE

History/PE ■ Findings that suggest an organic cause: Small testes, evidence of Peyronie disease, ↓ perineal sensation/cremaster reflex, or evidence of peripheral neuropathy/vasculopathy.

■ Assess peripheral pulses: Look for skin atrophy, hair loss, and low skin temperature.

Diagnosis ■ Obtain testosterone level if there is concern about 2° causes. ■ Check thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and glucose if there is a

concern regarding diabetes.

trEatmEnt ■ First line:

■ Treat underlying disease (eg, testosterone for hypogonadism). ■ Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil): Relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpora cavernosa results in improved blood flow causing tumescence. Adverse effects include flushing, headache, ↓ BP.

■ Contraindicated: Concurrent nitrates or α-blockers as they may cause refractory hypotension.

■ Failure of medical therapy: An external penile pump, inflatable penile prosthesis, vascular surgery.

■ Psychological treatment: Behavioral treatment for depression and anxiety. A PDE-5 inhibitor may be effective for psychogenic causes.

Hyperplasia of the prostate, leading to bladder outlet obstruction. Risk ↑ with age; common in patients > 45 years of age. In patients < 45 years of age with urinary retention, consider urethral stricture or a neuropathic etiology.

History/PE ■ Patients complain of frequency, urgency, nocturia, ↓ force and size of the urinary stream, and incomplete emptying leading to overflow incontinence.

■ Exam reveals a firm, rubbery, smooth prostatic surface (vs rock-hard areas that suggest prostate cancer).

Diagnosis ■ Diagnosed by history and exam. Check a UA for infection or hematuria,

both of which should prompt further evaluation.

■ Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is ↑ in up to 50% of patients but is not diagnostically useful.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: α-blockers (terazosin), 5α-reductase inhibitors (finasteride). ■ Avoid anticholinergics, antihistamines, or narcotics. ■ Refractory to medical treatment: Transurethral resection of the prostate; indications include recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder stones, hematuria, episodes of acute urinary retention, and renal failure 2° to obstruction.

Epididymitis/Orchitis ■ Epididymitis is defined as an acute infection that results in posterior and superior testicular tenderness. It is the most common cause of scrotal pain in adults.

■ Orchitis is associated with diffuse testicular pain.

■ ■

In men > 35 years of age, Escherichia coli is the most common cause. In men < 35 years of age, Chlamydia is most common.

■ Dx: CBC, UA and urine culture, Gram stain for gonococcal infection and trichomoniasis, nucleic acid amplification tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, Doppler ultrasound (shows ↑ blood flow). ■ Tx: Antibiotics and supportive therapy (analgesics, ice packs, scrotal sup-

port and elevation).

Testicular Torsion ■ A urologic emergency that requires immediate intervention owing to the

potential for resulting infertility.

■ Hx/PE: The affected testicle sits higher and is painful. Cremasteric reflex may be absent on the affected side.

■ Dx: Doppler ultrasound (shows ↓ blood flow). ■ Tx: Manual detorsion or surgical intervention. Surgical orchiopexy of

Depth of invasion of the melanoma.

■ HIV infection: Screening for HIV infection is recommended for individu- als 15 to 65 years of age at least once, with annual screening for individuals with high-risk factors. Women should be screened with each pregnancy. ■ Hypertension: BP screening should be done every 2 years in normoten- sive adults and every year for those with a systolic BP of 120–139 or a diastolic BP of 80–90. For young patients (age < 50 years of age) with an ↑ BP, look for 2° causes of hypertension, such as chronic kidney disease, pheochromocytoma, thyroid/parathyroid disease, sleep apnea, renovascu- lar disease, Cushing syndrome, coarctation of the aorta, and 1° hyperaldosteronism.

2

Although erectile dysfunction is associated with age, it is still considered abnormal, and patients with erection difficulties should be adequately evaluated for all potential causes.

3

α1-blockers such as terazosin act on smooth muscle in the prostate, bladder neck, and urethra. They also act on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation; therefore, they can work to lower hypertension as well.

■ Hyperlipidemia: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends screening men ≥ 35 years of age and women ≥ 45 years of age for lipid disorders. In the setting of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, screening should begin earlier (20–45 years of age). Treatment measures are outlined in Chapter 3. Risk factors that modify LDL goals include: ■ Cigarette smoking. ■ Hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 or on antihypertensive medication).

======================================
■ Patient has history of CAD or non-CAD atherosclerosis (eg, peripheral artery disease, carotid artery stenosis).

■ Diabetes. ■ A family history of cardiovascular disease before age 50 in male rela-

tives or age 60 in female relatives.

■ Obesity.

■ Diabetes: The ADA recommends testing for diabetes or prediabetes in all adults with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (see below). For those without risk factors, testing should begin at age 45. A fasting plasma glucose, a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, or an HbA1c (≥ 6.5%) is appropriate. Additional risk factors for diabetes are as follows: ■ A family history of DM in a first-degree relative. ■ Habitual physical inactivity. ■ High-risk ethnic or racial group (eg, African-American, Hispanic,

Native American, Asian-American, Pacific Islander).

■ A history of delivering a baby weighing > 4.1 kg (9 lb) or gestational diabetes.

■ Hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90). ■ Dyslipidemia. ■ Polycystic ovarian syndrome. ■ A history of vascular disease.

■ Osteoporosis: The USPSTF recommends that women ≥ 65 years of age be screened no more than every 2 years by DEXA scan. Screening should

A Pap smear and hypertension screening. A diabetes workup (eg, a fasting glucose test, a 2-hour glucose tolerance test, or an HbA1c) is not needed as the patient is < 45 years of age with a normal BMI. Given the patient’s age, a screening mammogram is controversial. It is important to discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of screening before proceeding.

begin earlier for postmenopausal women who are at ↑ risk for osteoporotic fractures (eg, low weight, low estrogen state, long-term use of oral or injected steroids). DEXA is the screening test of choice.

■ Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): The USPSTF recommends one-time screening for AAA in men 65–75 years of age who have smoked at any time. Abdominal ultrasound is the screening test of choice.

How to Use This Section

In this section are 100 minicases reflecting the types of clinical situations encountered on the actual CCS. Each case consists of columns that start on the left-hand page and end on the right-hand page with the Final Diagnosis. As you read each column, ask yourself what you should do and/or think next (see Table 19-1). If no results are given for a test, assume that it is normal. To get the most out of these minicases, we strongly recommend that you do at least a few of the CCS cases on the USMLE website to get a feel for the case flow and key decision points. This will allow you to place the minicases in context.

Major risk factors for ischemic heart disease: ■ Age > 65 years ■ Diabetes mellitus ■ Family history ■ Hyperlipidemia ■ Hypertension ■ Male gender ■ Smoking

KEY FACT

Unstable angina is any new angina in previously asymptomatic patients or accelerating or new angina at rest in patients with prior stable angina. In patients with known stable angina, unstable angina may present with acceleration or worsening of prior anginal symptoms.

|

KEY FACT

Certain patients—including people with diabetes, women, and elderly persons—can present with ischemic disease with highly atypical symptoms. Diabetes is considered a CAD risk equivalent.

Ischemic Heart Disease

The 1° cause of ischemic heart disease is atherosclerotic occlusion of the cor- onary arteries. In addition to individual patient risk factors, a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease is family history, particularly of early coronary artery disease (CAD) in a first-degree relative, as defined by significant disease in male relatives before age 55 or in female relatives before age 65.

History/PE ■ May be asymptomatic or present as follows:

■ Stable angina: Typical substernal chest pressure or shortness of breath that is exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Reflects a stable, flow-limiting plaque.

■ Unstable angina or MI (acute coronary syndrome): Chest pressure and/ or shortness of breath that occur at rest or with minimal exertion, often with a duration of > 20 minutes. Pain tends not to improve markedly with nitroglycerin or recurs soon after its use. Reflects plaque rupture with formation of a clot in the lumen of the blood vessel.

■ Not all patients present with typical anginal symptoms. Ask about other symptoms that are considered “anginal equivalents,” such as dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis. Some patients may complain of indigestion.

■ Exam may be normal when patients are asymptomatic. During episodes of angina, a left ventricular S4 or a mitral regurgitation murmur may occa- sionally be heard on cardiac auscultation.

■ Look for signs of heart failure (eg, ↑ jugular venous pulse [JVP], inspira- tory crackles, hepatomegaly, lower extremity edema) that could be due to prior MI and may be causing left ventricular dysfunction.

■ Look for vascular disease elsewhere (eg, carotid, abdominal, and femoral bruits; asymmetric or diminished pulses; and lower extremity ischemic ulcers).

■ Other potential signs include diaphoresis and the Levine sign (clenched right fist held over the chest when describing pain).

DiffErEntial Consider pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, aortic dissection, peptic ulcer, esophageal disease (including diffuse esophageal spasm), gastro- esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and musculoskeletal causes. Chest pain from anxiety should be a diagnosis of exclusion.

Diagnosis ■ Initial workup: +/− ECG changes (ST-segment elevation/depression/Q waves) in the distribution of the coronary arteries (see Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Figure 3-1); elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin, creatine kinase [CK], CK–MB fraction). Consider tests (eg, CXR, D-dimer) to evaluate for other causes of chest pain. Non-ST-segment-elevation MI (NSTEMI) can be distinguished from unstable angina by the presence of elevated car- diac biomarkers.

■ Stress testing: Exercise, dobutamine, or vasodilator stress; ECG, echocar- diography, or radionuclide imaging to assess perfusion (see the discussion of advanced cardiac evaluation below).

■ Cardiac catheterization: Defines anatomy and the location and severity of lesions; can also be used for reperfusion. ST-segment-elevation MI (STEMI) is a high-risk MI that requires emergency catheterization for reperfusion.

trEatmEnt ■ Acute coronary syndrome:

■ Initial treatment: Anticoagulation (low molecular weight heparin [LMWH], unfractionated heparin), aspirin, nitroglycerin, supplemen- tal O2, and a β-blocker in hemodynamically stable patients. Antiplate- let agents (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) are often used as well if a percutaneous stent is placed. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (abcix- imab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) or bivalirudin may be used in the cathe- terization laboratory when angioplasty is pursued.

■ STEMIs or NSTEMIs with high-risk features should be managed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if available at that hospital. If PCI is unavailable or cannot be initiated within 90 minutes, tPA should be given. If possible, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibi- tor (ACEI) should be started before discharge.

■ Angina: β-blockers ↓ HR, ↑ myocardial perfusion time, and ↓ cardiac workload, which ↓ exertional angina. If symptoms arise on a β-blocker, a long-acting nitrate or calcium channel blocker (CCB) can be added. Ranolazine can be added for refractory angina.

2° PrEvEntion ■ Risk-factor modification (to slow progression): Control diabetes, ↓ BP, ↓

cholesterol (specifically LDL), and encourage smoking cessation.

■ Prevention of MI: Aspirin; clopidogrel can be given to aspirin-sensitive patients.

■ Drugs that improve mortality after MI: Aspirin, β-blockers, ACEIs (or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] in ACEI-intolerant patients), hydroxy- methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors (statins), and spironolactone in high-risk subgroups. Antiplatelet agents are used following coronary stent placement, usually for a minimum of 12 months.

KEY FACT

Any condition that causes delayed left ventricular emptying (eg, aortic stenosis, left bundle branch block [LBBB]) can be associated with paradoxical splitting. Delayed emptying leads to delayed A2, with P2 heard before A2. On inspiration, A2 and P2 move closer together, eliminating a split S2.

KEY FACT

Half of patients with moderate to severe acute mitral regurgitation have no audible murmur.

5

KEY FACT

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) produce holosystolic murmurs that radiate throughout the precordium, often with a thrill. They are the most common cardiac malformation at birth.

Valvular Disease

Table 3-3 describes the clinical characteristics and treatment of common val- vular lesions.

Heart Failure

Defined as inability of the heart to pump adequate blood to meet the demands of the body. One categorization scheme includes:

■ Systolic heart failure. ■ Diastolic heart failure. ■ Heart failure related to valvular disease. ■ Heart failure related to arrhythmias.

S Y S T O L I C H E A R T FA I L U R E

Weakened pump function of the heart. Sometimes referred to as “heart failure with reduced ejection fraction” (HFrEF). Common causes include ischemic heart disease, long-standing hypertension, toxins (eg, alcohol), and viral or idio- pathic cardiomyopathy in younger patients.

History/PE ■ Poor exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnea, and easy fatigability. ■ Orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, poor appetite, RUQ pain,

and ankle swelling (due to volume overload).

■ Exam often reveals inspiratory crackles (may be absent in chronic heart fail- ure); a diffuse left-displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), reflecting cardiomegaly; an S3 gallop, ↑ JVP; and lower extremity edema. Cool extremities and/or confusion may suggest low cardiac output.

KEY FACT

ACEIs, ARBs, and spironolactone all cause hyperkalemia and should be avoided or used cautiously in patients with hyperkalemia and/or renal impairment.

KEY FACT

VT leading to VF is a common cause of death in patients with a ↓ EF. Thus, ICD placement is indicated for patients with an EF < 35%, and CRT is indicated for those with a ↓ EF and intraventricular delay.

CARDIOLOGY

DiffErEntial Deconditioning, lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, 1° pulmonary hypertension), other categories of heart failure (eg, diastolic dysfunction), other causes of edema (eg, cirrhosis, vascular incompetence, low albumin, nephrotic syndrome).

Diagnosis ■ The history and exam are suggestive, but determination of the EF via an imaging study (eg, echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, cardiac MRI) confirms the diagnosis.

■ Look for the cause of the low EF:

■ Perform a stress test or cardiac catheterization to look for CAD; evalu- ate for thyroid and renal disease.

■ Look for a history of alcohol use or exposure to offending cardiotoxic medications such as doxorubicin.

■ Consider dilated cardiomyopathy in postpartum women. ■ Consider myocardial biopsy in selected cases to evaluate for infiltrative disease or other rare causes when other evaluations are inconclusive.

trEatmEnt ■ Based on optimizing cardiac output via the following mechanisms:

■ ↓ Preload (reducing cardiac filling pressures). ■ ↓ Wall stress and optimization of cardiac contractility. ■ ↓ Afterload (making it easier for the heart to pump systemically).

■ Maintenance medications include:

■ Preload reduction: Diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide). ■ ↓ Wall stress: β-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol). ■ Optimization of contractility: Digoxin (may lower the frequency of

hospitalizations and improve symptoms but does not ↓ mortality).

■ Afterload reduction: Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone antagonists (ACEIs/ ARBs; spironolactone if potassium and creatinine are not ↑ and the patient is on optimal dosages of β-blockers and ACEIs/ARBs). Hydrala- zine and nitrates may be useful additions to ACEIs/ARBs in African- American patients or an alternative to ACEIs/ARBs in patients with kidney disease/hyperkalemia. Spironolactone improves mortality in symptomatic systolic heart failure. ACEI or ARB can be replaced by an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor in appropriate patients with mild to moderate disease.

■ Exacerbations: Give loop diuretics such as furosemide when the patient is volume overloaded. These are given first in IV form and then transitioned to oral form once the patient is closer to euvolemia. β-blockers and after- load reduction agents can be initiated once the patient is euvolemic.

■ Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are associated with ↓ mortality from ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in heart failure patients who are symptomatic and have a ↓ EF (< 35%). Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is sometimes indicated in heart failure patients with both a ↓ EF and intraventricular conduction delay (QRS > 120 msec).

■ Treat the underlying cause of the systolic heart failure (eg, CAD).
======================================
D I A S T O L I C H E A R T FA I L U R E

During diastole, the heart is stiff and does not relax well, resulting in ↑ dia- stolic filling pressure. However, the EF is often normal, so diastolic heart fail- ure is sometimes referred to as “heart failure with preserved ejection fraction”

(HFpEF). Hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the most common cause; other causes include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and infil- trative diseases.

5B

KEY FACT

History/PE ■ Signs and symptoms are the same as those of systolic heart failure. ■ Exam findings are like those of systolic heart failure. Listen for an S4 rather than an S3 (if rhythm is regular) or an irregular rhythm (atrial fibril- lation [AF] is commonly associated with diastolic dysfunction).

Important 2° causes of diastolic heart failure: ■ Sarcoidosis ■ Amyloidosis ■ Hemochromatosis ■ Scleroderma ■ Fibrosis (radiation, surgery)

Diagnosis Echocardiography shows preserved EF, often accompanied with ventricular hypertrophy. Biopsy may be needed to establish the underlying diagnosis if infiltrative disease is suspected. Cardiac MRI is becoming an increasingly popular modality for this purpose.

trEatmEnt ■

Initially control hypertension. Give diuretics to control volume overload and symptoms, but avoid overdiuresis, which can ↓ preload and cardiac output.

■ Manage arrhythmias (eg, AF) that are frequently associated with diastolic dysfunction.

■ Control renal and vascular disease, both of which are thought to be associ- ated with diastolic heart disease.

5

KEY FACT

Active ischemia can acutely worsen diastolic dysfunction and cause systolic dysfunction, so treat any coexisting CAD in patients with diastolic heart failure.

KEY FACT

Chronic constrictive pericarditis often presents with ascites, hepatomegaly, and distended neck veins. A common cause in North America is prior pericardiotomy (from cardiac surgery). TB is a cause that is uncommon in North America.

(Dressler syndrome), cancer, rheumatologic diseases (systemic lupus erythe- matosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis [RA]), uremia, tuberculosis (TB), and prior cardiac surgery. May also be idiopathic (the most common cause of acute cases).

History/PE ■ Presents with chest pain that is often improved with sitting up or leaning forward. The pain may radiate to the back and to the left trapezial ridge. If a large effusion is present, the patient may be short of breath.

■ ■ Exam may reveal a pericardial friction rub (a leathery sound that can be

present in multiple stages of the cardiac cycle).

DiffErEntial Myocardial ischemia, aortic dissection, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax.

Diagnosis ■ A number of clinical and ECG features can distinguish pericarditis from

acute MI (see Table 3-5).

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). TTE provides specific information, such as left ventricular ejection factor (LVEF) and diastolic compliance and relaxation, which can confirm the diagnosis of systolic and diastolic heart failure. It also yields information about specific etiologies or precipitants such as valvular or wall motion abnormalities.

■ Echocardiography may reveal an associated pericardial effusion. ■ Search for an underlying cause (ie, take a history for viral illness, radiation exposure, and malignancy). Check antinuclear antibody (ANA), PPD, blood cultures if febrile, and renal function.

trEatmEnt ■ Where possible, treat the underlying disorder (eg, SLE, advanced renal

failure).

■ For viral or idiopathic pericarditis, give NSAIDs, colchicine, or aspirin. Avoid NSAIDs or steroids in early post-MI pericarditis, as they may inter- fere with scar formation.

ComPliCations Patients may develop a clinically significant pericardial effusion and tampon- ade (see below).

P E R I C A R D I A L E F F U S I O N A N D C A R D I A C TA M P O N A D E

Accumulation of fluid (usually chronic) or blood (usually acute and posttrau- matic/postsurgical) in the pericardial cavity surrounding the heart.

History/PE ■ Symptomatology often depends on the rate of fluid accumulation. If acute, patients may present with shock. If chronic, patients may present with shortness of breath and heart failure (if gradual, several liters of fluid may accumulate). In patients with pericardial effusions and tamponade physiology, exam classically reveals distant or muffled heart sounds, ↑ JVP, and pulsus para- doxus (a drop of > 10 mm Hg in systolic BP [blood pressure] during inspi- ration). Pulsus paradoxus may be absent in a patient with tamponade physiology if there is concurrent aortic regurgitation or atrial septal defect.

5

KEY FACT

Always check a bedside pulsus paradoxus when tamponade is suspected. Echocardiography is the diagnostic procedure of choice.

Diagnosis ■ Initial test: Echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis. ■ CXR may reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette (see Figure 3-3), and ECG may show low voltages and electrical alternans (beat-to-beat variation in R-wave amplitude).

trEatmEnt ■ Consider emergent pericardiocentesis for patients with post–chest trauma shock as well as for those whose echocardiogram shows evidence of tam- ponade physiology.

■ Also consider a pericardial window for those with recurrent or malignant effusions. While evaluation with echocardiography is being pursued, give IV fluids to maintain preload and systemic BP.

Advanced Cardiac Evaluation

Indications for stress testing include diagnosis of CAD/evaluation of symp- toms, preoperative evaluation, risk stratification in patients with known dis- ease, and decision making about the need for revascularization.

■ Contraindications include severe aortic stenosis, acute coronary syndrome, acute pulmonary embolus, unstable arrhythmias, and decompensated heart failure.

■ Testing consists of a stressing modality and an evaluating modality (see Tables 3-6 and 3-7).

■ Within pharmacologic stressing modalities, dobutamine ↑ cardiac con- tractility, whereas adenosine and dipyridamole dilate the coronary arteries (the latter ↑ blood flow in healthy arteries but not in already maximally dilated diseased arteries, creating a differential flow that can be detected on nuclear imaging).

updated to reflect the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guidelines.

■ Based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, a systolic BP of 120–139 and a diastolic BP of < 80 is considered “elevated.” There is no longer the desig- nation of “prehypertension.”

■ Stage 1 hypertension: Systolic BP between 130–139 or diastolic BP between 80–89.

■ Stage 2 hypertension: Systolic BP of at least 140 or diastolic BP of at least 90.

5

KEY FACT

The goal BP in almost all patients including those with diabetes or CKD is < 130/80.

5

KEY FACT

The treatment of hypertension in African-American patients should begin with thiazide diuretics or CCBs.

trEatmEnt ■ Based on the most recent guidelines, the goal BP for almost all patients, including those with diabetes or CKD, is < 130/80. This represents a change from earlier guidelines, which recommended a goal of < 140/90 in those with diabetes and those with renal insufficiency. (Note: The goal BP recommended in the last several guidelines has been the subject of controversy.)

■ New guidelines also suggest initiating treatment with two medications for

Stage 2 hypertension, with the goal BP of < 130/80. Interventions include the following: ■ Step 1—lifestyle modification: Weight loss, exercise, ↓ sodium intake,

smoking cessation.

■ Step 2—medications: First-line agents include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, or ARBs unless there is a more specific indication for another class of drugs (see Table 3-9). Thiazide diuretics and CCBs considered first line for African-Americans.

■ Control other cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia.

ComPliCations Long-standing hypertension contributes to CAD, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, and stroke.

.\

Thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs are all therapeutic options. The BP goal for this patient would be < 130/80. In light of his cough (a potential adverse effect of ACEIs), you could switch the patient to an ARB and add a second medication to achieve goal BP.

Peripheral Vascular Disease

Atherosclerotic disease of vessels other than the coronary arteries. Risk factors are similar to those for CAD and include smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterol- emia, hypertension, and increasing age.

History/PE Depends on the affected organ(s).

■ Abdominal aortic aneurysm: Palpate for a pulsatile mass in the abdomi- nal midline.

■ Mesenteric ischemia: Postprandial abdominal pain and food avoidance (“food fear”), bloody diarrhea. On exam, no specific findings. May observe thin habitus because of weight loss from avoidance of food.

■ Lower extremity disease: Claudication, leg ulceration or nonhealing wounds, rest pain. Look for ulcers and nonhealing wounds, diminished pulses, ↓ ankle-brachial indices, skin atrophy, and loss of hair. Listen for bruits over affected vessels (abdominal, femoral, popliteal).

■ Kidneys: Usually asymptomatic but may present with difficult-to-control hypertension. Listen for a bruit during systole and diastole (highly specific for renal artery stenosis).

■ CNS: Stroke and transient ischemic attack (see Chapter 13).

DiffErEntial ■ Abdominal pain: Stable symptoms can mimic peptic ulcer disease or biliary colic. If the colon is predominantly involved, episodes of pain and bloody stool can look like infectious colitis.

■ Lower extremities: Spinal stenosis can produce lower extremity discomfort similar to claudication. Claudication improves with rest (except for severe peripheral arterial disease with rest claudication), but spinal stenosis classi- cally improves with sitting forward (lumbar flexion improves spinal steno- sis symptoms).

Diagnosis ■ Mesenteric disease: Angiography reveals lesions. A diagnosis of exclusion. ■ Lower extremity disease: Ankle-brachial index (compares BP in the lower and upper extremities) and Doppler ultrasound. Angiography or magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) is used in preparation for revascularization but is generally not used for diagnosis.

■ Renal artery stenosis: CT angiography, MRA, conventional angiography, or ultrasound with Doppler flow (technically difficult).

trEatmEnt ■ Control modifiable risk factors, especially smoking. ■ Mesenteric disease: Treat with surgical revascularization or angioplasty. ■ Lower extremity disease: Treat with exercise (to improve functional capacity), surgical revascularization, and sometimes angioplasty. Cilo- stazol is moderately useful (improves pain-free walking distance by 50%), whereas pentoxifylline is of marginal benefit. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) is indicated to prevent cardiovascular events.

■ Renal artery stenosis: Surgery or angioplasty may be of benefit.

One of the principal factors contributing to atherosclerotic vascular disease. ↑ LDL and ↓ HDL are the 1° contributors. Can be idiopathic, genetic, or 2° to other diseases, such as diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, and hypothyroidism.

History/PE ■ Generally asymptomatic unless the patient develops ischemia (eg, angina, stroke, claudication) or unless severe hypertriglyceridemia leads to pancreatitis.

■ Look for evidence of atherosclerosis (eg, carotid, subclavian, abdominal and other bruits; diminished or asymmetric pulses; or ischemic foot ulcers or other skin or hair changes).

■ Look for xanthomas over the tendons, above the upper eyelid, and on the palms.

Diagnosis ■ Initial test: Order a lipid panel. A full panel consists of total cholesterol,

HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. In many cases, a nonfasting lipid profile can be obtained for ease of test- ing. Fasting and nonfasting total cholesterol and HDL values vary very lit- tle. However, triglyceride values ↑ following a meal. If triglyceride values are of concern, fasting levels should be obtained.

■ A fasting profile may also be helpful for quantifying LDL. Traditionally, LDL has not been measured directly but calculated on the basis of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides (via the Friedewald equation). High triglycerides (> 400 mg/dL) make LDL calculation unreliable. However, newer assays can measure LDL directly.

■ Look for other contributing conditions. Check glucose and TSH, check

body weight, and consider nephrotic syndrome. In patients with a family history of early heart disease, consider novel risk factors such as homocysteine, Lp(a), and C-reactive protein (CRP). These can be treated with folic acid supplementation, niacin, and statins, respectively.

■

trEatmEnt Aimed at preventing pancreatitis when triglycerides are very high (generally > 1000 mg/dL) and at preventing atherosclerotic disease (see Table 3-10).

■ LDL:

■ Traditional treatment has been based on goal LDL (eg, in patients with diabetes or CAD, the goal LDL was < 70 mg/dL; lower-risk patients had higher LDL goals). However, recent guidelines recommend per- cent reductions in LDL rather than absolute goals (eg, a 50% reduc- tion in LDL in high-intensity treatment and a 30–50% reduction in moderate-intensity treatment) based on patient risk profiles (see Figure 3-6).

■ The mainstay of treatment is diet, exercise, and a statin. LDL control is

the 1° cholesterol-related goal in patients with CAD or diabetes. ■ HDL: Can be modestly ↑ with fibrate or nicotinic acid. Although ↓ HDL has been associated with an ↑ risk of cardiovascular events, there is no definitive clinical benefit to using medications to ↑ HDL.

■ Triglycerides: If > 500 mg/dL, recommend dietary modification (↓ total fat, ↓ saturated fat, ↓ alcohol) and aerobic exercise, and begin medication

(fibrate or nicotinic acid). At lower levels, treatment can begin with diet and exercise, and medication can be added as needed. Treat diabetes and other concurrent metabolic syndrome risk factors if present.

Endocarditis

Inflammation of the heart valves. Can be infective or noninfective. Infective endocarditis (IE) is commonly seen in IV drug abusers, hemodialysis patients, and those with valvular lesions or prosthetic heart valves. Valvular thrombi are composed of bacteria and platelets and are devoid of WBCs. IE is further dis- tinguished as follows:

■ Acute IE (days): Usually affects normal heart valves and is most often caused by S aureus and β-hemolytic streptococci. IV drug users typically have S aureus organisms and right heart involvement.

■ Subacute IE (weeks to months): Usually colonizes a previously damaged valve in the setting of bacteremia from oral surgery or poor dentition. It is most often caused by the viridans group of streptococci. The aortic and mitral valves are most commonly affected.

5
======================================
KEY FACT

History/PE ■ Acute IE: Presents with fever, rigors, heart failure from valve destruction, and symptoms related to systemic emboli (neurologic impairment, back pain, pulmonary symptoms).

Streptococcus bovis bacterial endocarditis should raise suspicion for occult GI malignancy. These patients need a colonoscopy.

■ Subacute IE: Characterized by weeks to months of fever, malaise, and weight loss. Also presents with symptoms of systemic emboli.

■ Noninfective endocarditis: Generally asymptomatic. Can cause heart fail-

ure by destroying valves. ■ Listen for a new murmur. ■ Look for involvement of multiple organs (see Table 3-11).

DiffErEntial The differential diagnosis of endocarditis is outlined below and in Table 3-12.

■ For vegetation found on echocardiography: IE, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE, also known as marantic endocarditis), verrucous endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis), valve degeneration.

■ For bacteremia: IE, infected hardware (eg, from a central line), abscess, osteomyelitis.

raphy. It may be found during the workup of systemic emboli. IE is diagnosed by a combination of lab and clinical data. If suspicious, obtain at least three sets of blood cultures and an echocardiogram. If trans- thoracic echocardiography (TTE) is ⊝, proceed to TEE (more sensitive). ⊕ Blood cultures and echocardiogram findings together are strongly sug- gestive of IE. The modified Duke criteria are often used for diagnosis (see Table 3-13).

■

Any patient with S aureus bacteremia should be evaluated for endocarditis with echocardiography.

5B

KEY FACT

trEatmEnt ■ Treat with prolonged antibiotic therapy, generally for 4–6 weeks (can be as short as 2 weeks for small subgroups of patients; > 6 weeks for patients with highly virulent organisms). Begin empiric therapy with gentamicin and antistaphylococcal penicillin (oxacillin or nafcillin). If there is a risk of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), treat empirically with vancomycin instead of oxacillin/nafcillin.

Surgery is indicated in the setting of hemodynamic instability, heart- failure symptoms, valvular destruction, conduction abnormalities, perivalvular extension, fungal endocarditis, or persistently ⊕ blood cultures. Surgery should not be delayed while the acute infection is cleared with antibiotics.

■ Valve replacement is appropriate for fungal endocarditis, HF from valve destruction, valve ring abscess, cardiac conduction abnormalities, persis- tently ⊕ blood cultures despite antibiotic treatment, large or mobile vege- tations, or systemic emboli despite adequate antibiotic therapy.

■ Following treatment for IE, patients should receive endocarditis prophylaxis.

■ For NBTE, treat the underlying disorder (often malignancy). Systemic anticoagulation (LMWH or unfractionated heparin) is useful for prevent- ing recurrent emboli. Surgery is rarely indicated.

■ For verrucous endocarditis, no treatment is required. Patients should receive endocarditis prophylaxis (see below).

A 26-year-old IV drug user is admitted to the hospital with fevers and chills. Despite broad antibiotic therapy, blood cultures remain persistently ⊕, but TTE is normal. Given your suspicion of infective endocarditis, what is your next step?

Order a TEE, which is more sensitive than TTE for visualizing vegetations and diagnosing endocarditis. When endocarditis is suspected clinically but TTE is normal, a TEE is indicated to better confirm or rule out infection.

■ Congenital cardiac disease:

■ Unrepaired cyanotic disease, including those with palliative shunts and devices.

■ Congenital cardiac defects that have been completely repaired during the first 6 months after the repair (endothelialization occurs after 6 months).

■ Repaired congenital cardiac disease with residual defects that may inhibit endothelialization.

■ Other:

■ Prosthetic heart valves (both homograft and bioprosthetic). ■ A patient history of prior IE. ■ Cardiac transplant patients with cardiac valvulopathy.

■ Guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis:

■ Dental procedures: All dental procedures that involve the manipula- tion of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth, as well as proce- dures involving perforation of the oral mucosa (not for routine anesthetic injections through noninfected tissue, dental radiographs, bleeding from trauma, adjustment of orthodontic devices, or shedding of deciduous teeth).

■ Respiratory tract procedures: Any of the above-mentioned cardiac patients who are undergoing an invasive procedure of the respiratory tract that involves incision (eg, tonsillectomy) or biopsy of the respira- tory mucosa (includes bronchoscopy with biopsy).

■ Skin procedures: Any of the above-mentioned cardiac patients who are undergoing procedures involving infected skin or musculoskeletal tissue.

■ GI and GU procedures: Prophylaxis is not recommended even for high-risk patients but may be considered in special scenarios involving the above-mentioned cardiac patients.

■ Prophylactic regimens: Amoxicillin (or clindamycin, azithromycin, or cephalexin for those with penicillin allergy) 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

ComPliCations Spinal osteomyelitis, valve destruction and heart failure, stroke and pulmo- nary or renal damage (from septic emboli), metastatic abscesses, mycotic aneurysms.

MNEMONIC

Glasgow Coma Scale—

Less than 8…Intubate!

|

KEY FACT

Hemodilution does not occur in acute hemorrhage, so hematocrit will be normal initially; don’t be falsely reassured. Patients don’t bleed normal saline, so limit crystalloid resuscitation and administer blood products.

5

KEY FACT

When initially assessing disability in trauma, put your tuning fork away. Is the patient talking, moving, following commands, and can he feel his arms and legs? Good!

EMERGENCY MEDICINE

|_| Trauma

Trauma

The acute management of trauma patients follows a linear algorithm that should be performed in the same order every time: the ABCDE approach (1° survey) followed by FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) and the 2° survey. This ensures that no important steps in the initial assessment and resuscitation will be skipped.

In actual practice, multiple steps occur simultaneously (eg, IV fluids are administered as an airway is being secured). However, the USMLE often asks about the “next step,” thereby testing your understanding of the algorithm rather than your ability to manage multiple therapeutic approaches at the same time. It is the team leader’s responsibility to ensure that the 1° survey is completed before the 2° survey is begun.

T H E 1 ° S U R V E Y

■ A—Airway maintenance with cervical spine control. Indications for a

definitive airway (eg, intubation, cricothyroidotomy): ■ Patient cannot protect his airway. ■ Patient cannot be ventilated by bag-valve mask (eg, facial trauma). ■

Impending or complete airway failure (eg, inhalation burn, severe head/neck trauma). Includes failure to oxygenate or ventilate as expected.

■ Any of the above conditions expected in the immediate future.

■ B—Breathing with ventilation. Quickly evaluate for and treat causes of impending cardiopulmonary failure/death (eg, tension or open pneumo- thorax, massive hemothorax, or airway obstruction).

■ C—Circulation with hemorrhage control.

■ Resuscitation: Think short and fat IV lines—2 large-bore (14- or 16-gauge) IVs. Central lines have high flow resistance and take too long to insert. May also use intraosseous cannulation.

■ 16-gauge IV 150 cc/min flow rate > 16-gauge triple-lumen port 70 cc/ min flow rate. Flow resistance ↑ with catheter length.

■ Resuscitate with 2 L of crystalloid. If further resuscitation is needed based on unstable vital signs or ongoing bleeding, switch to O negative blood.

■ D—Disability determined by a brief neurologic exam—assessing mental status and size of pupils—and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. A depressed GCS = patient cannot protect airway (see Figure 4-1).

■ E—Exposure/Environmental control: Completely undress the patient to assess for injury, but avoid hypothermia.

Consists of total patient evaluation and is the time to order appropriate lab tests and radiographs based on the mechanism of injury, past medical history, and physical exam findings.

■ Conduct a focused PE:

■ Head and skull: Inspect for trauma, pupils, and loss of consciousness. Look for ecchymosis around the eyes (see Figure 4-2) and hemotympa- num, which point to a basilar skull fracture. Inspect the ears and nose for cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leakage. If a septal hematoma is present, it will need to be drained once the patient is stabilized. Assess for mid- face instability, ocular/orbital trauma, or intraoral injuries. Ecchymosis of the mastoid process (Battle sign) is a late sign of basilar skull fracture and is rarely found on initial presentation.

■ Neck: Look for trauma or a pulsatile/expanding hematoma; palpate for midline cervical spine tenderness, crepitus, and tracheal deformity. ■ Chest: Listen for equal bilateral breath sounds. (If absent/asymmetric or if there is crepitus on palpation of the chest, suspect pneumothorax. Listen for clear heart sounds (if muffled and accompanied by jugular venous distention [JVD], suspect cardiac tamponade). Inspect for irreg- ular or paradoxical breathing patterns resulting from multiple rib frac- tures (ie, flail chest). A new diastolic murmur after trauma suggests aortic dissection.

■ Abdomen: Inspect the abdomen and flanks for signs of trauma, usually indicated by bruising. Palpate the pelvis for tenderness or instability. Do not compress the pelvis anteriorly/posteriorly; if the patient has an “open-book” fracture, doing so will make it significantly worse.

■ Perineum/rectum/vagina: Assess for trauma, including urethral bleed- ing (suggests urethral tear). Check for prostate position, rectal tone, and rectal blood. Check women for vaginal trauma and blood in the vaginal vault.

■ Musculoskeletal system: Look for evidence of trauma, including con- tusions, lacerations, and deformities. Inspect the extremities for tender- ness, crepitus, abnormal range of motion, and sensation. An externally rotated, shortened leg suggests hip fracture.

■ Back, axilla, perineum: Look for hidden injuries. Roll the patient! Don’t miss the gunshot wound to the back because you were worried about the one on the front.

■ Assess and reassess: Traumatic injuries can dynamically change. ■ Obtain an AMPLE history: Inquire about Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last oral intake, Events/Environmental factors related to the injury. If the patient can speak, ask about other symptoms that may not be obvious on exam. Obtain as much information as possible from EMTs/ paramedics about the circumstances of the trauma.

■ Imaging:

■ Head and skull: Obtain a CT of the head and face if there is evidence of trauma. Maintain a low threshold for scanning intoxicated patients, elderly patients, and those on blood thinners.

■ Neck: Maintain in-line immobilization and protection with a hard cer- vical collar. Obtain a cervical spine CT if a fracture cannot be cleared clinically by National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria.

EMERGENCY MEDICINE

■ Chest: Rapidly assess for pneumothorax with ultrasound. Obtain a CXR in all patients with significant trauma. Penetrating thoracic wounds or clinical concern for major intrathoracic trauma often requires a chest CT angiography.

■ Abdomen: Obtain a pelvic x-ray; do a FAST scan, and/or an abdomi- nal CT if indicated. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is never done.

■ Urinary system: If there is blood at the urethral meatus or a “high-riding” prostate, consult urology for a urethrogram. Do not insert a Foley.

■ Musculoskeletal system: Obtain an arteriogram if vascular injury is suspected (eg, pulsating or expanding hematoma, distal perfusion defi- cit). Obtain radiographs as needed for extremity injuries. Knee disloca- tions (not patellar dislocations) require a CT angiogram to rule out popliteal artery injury.
======================================
Management of Emergent Procedures

You should be familiar with the indications for a variety of emergent procedures.

■ Intubation: Airway failure, respiratory failure, depressed GCS, or flail chest (serial rib fractures in at least two places create a paradoxically mov- ing chest wall) will likely require intubation to assist with breathing.

■ Cricothyroidotomy: Can’t ventilate and can’t intubate? It’s time to get out the scalpel.

■ Needle thoracostomy: Only for tension pneumothorax and only a tempo- rizing step prior to chest tube insertion. Inserting a chest tube takes several minutes. A 14-gauge needle to the second intercostal space midclavicular line takes seconds.

■ Tube thoracostomy (aka chest tube): The treatment for pneumothorax and hemothorax.

■ Pericardiocentesis: Perform if ultrasound shows a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.

■ Emergent thoracotomy: For patients in extremis with suspected penetrat- ing injury to the heart or disruption of major vessels (aorta, pulmonary artery).

Shock

A major complication of both medical and surgical emergencies. Rapid clini- cal assessment of circulatory status includes pulse, skin color, and level of consciousness. The evolution of the symptoms of shock is shown in Figure 4-3.

■ Low BP does not in itself represent shock. Shock is a physiologic O2 supply/ demand mismatch. ↓ Tissue perfusion leads to cell hypoxia with subse- quent dysfunction and eventual tissue death. Consequently, liver function tests (LFTs), creatinine, and troponin may be ↑ in severe shock. Lactic acid is a useful marker for tissue hypoperfusion or tissue death.

■ Classically, shock has been divided into four types by physiologic response: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, distributive, and obstructive. Distributive shock is further subdivided into septic, anaphylactic, and neurogenic shock. These types are reviewed in Table 4-1.

Orthopedic Injuries

Patients present to the ED with a variety of orthopedic complaints, a detailed discussion of which is beyond the scope of this book. This section provides a high-yield summary of common and dangerous conditions, their diagnostic workup, and their initial management. In general, any compromise of blood flow or nerve function due to fracture/dislocation is an indication for an emer- gent reduction.

A N K L E I N J U R I E S

■ Traumatic ankle injuries are among the most common orthopedic com- plaints encountered in the ED. The spectrum of injury ranges from sprains (damage to a ligament) to significant fracture requiring operative intervention. In general, the Ottawa ankle rules (see Figure 4-4) guide the clinician in determining which patients need radiographic imaging. If there is concern for syndesmotic disruption between the tibia and fibula, rupture of the deltoid ligament, or ankle instability due to fractures, stress views of the ankle should also be added (x-ray in supination/external rotation).

■

■

K N E E I N J U R I E S

■ Knee pain is another common reason patients present to the ED. Several exam maneuvers should be performed to assess for certain injuries.

■ A locking sensation on passive range of motion or pain with axial load- ing may be a sign of meniscal injury.

■ Active range of motion not resulting in full extension or inability to lift against resistance can indicate quadriceps or patellar tendon rupture. ■ The Lachman test and posterior drawer test assess anterior cruciate lig-

ament and posterior cruciate ligament integrity respectively.

■ Varus/valgus stress assesses the integrity of the medial/lateral collateral ligaments.

■ Knee dislocation in obese patients may occur after only minor trauma and may self-reduce before presentation to the ED.

H I P I N J U R I E S

■ The differential for hip pain is highly dependent on the age of the patient.

■ Children and adolescents (particularly if they are obese) are at risk for a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (see Figure 4-5) or Legg-Calvé- Perthes disease (avascular necrosis of the femoral head; typically affects children 4–8 years of age). If the hip pain was preceded by a recent URI, the patient may be suffering from toxic synovitis. Keep in mind that the presenting complaint for hip issues in children may be knee pain.

■ Older patients are at high risk for “hip fractures” (technically a proxi- mal femur fracture) 2° to osteopenia. Classically, the affected limb is shortened and externally rotated.

■ Other causes of hip pain include osteoarthritis and trochanteric bursitis. In

addition, patients of all ages are at risk for hip dislocation. ■ A dislocation typically occurs when a tremendous amount of force is thrust upon the hip joint (eg, when a flexed knee hits a dashboard in a motor vehicle accident).

■ The vascular supply to the femoral head may be strained or severed in a hip dislocation placing the patient at risk of developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head as a delayed complication. Expeditious reduction is indicated to minimize the risk to the artery.

■ Galeazzi fracture: A distal 1/3 radius fracture with a distal radioulnar dislocation.

■ Colles fracture: A distal radius fracture with dorsal displacement after a Fall Onto OutStretched Hand (FOOSH) injury. Most common in elderly osteopenic women.

O R T H O P E D I C P E A R L S

■ Tenderness over the scaphoid bone requires splinting even if initial x-rays are ⊝ to help prevent future complication of avascular necrosis. A scaph- oid fracture may take several days to become visible on x-rays.

■ Compartment syndrome typically features good pulses and sensation until it reaches an advanced state. Excruciating pain with passive movement is the earliest clinical sign.

■ Ankle injuries may lead to proximal fibula injury (Maisonneuve fracture)

and are at higher risk for compartment syndrome. ■ Shoulder dislocations may lead to axillary nerve injury. ■ Supracondylar fractures in children may lead to radial nerve injury. ■ Clavicle fractures are typically treated conservatively with a sling. ■ The first rib, proximal clavicle, sternum, scapula, and femur require signif-

icant force to fracture. Look for other injuries.

Common Dysrhythmias

Tables 4-2 and 4-3 illustrate a variety of important dysrhythmias. In general, these can be subdivided into narrow-complex arrhythmias originating in the atria and wide-complex arrhythmias originating in the ventricles or secondary to conduction pathway abnormalities. These can further be subdivided into “tachy” and “brady” arrhythmias.

Advanced Cardiac Life Support

Provides a framework for resuscitating a critically ill medical patient. Circula- tion is addressed before airway and breathing, with cardiopulmonary resusci- tation (CPR) being performed before attempting intubation. Epinephrine remains an advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) drug, as it ↑ the rate of return of spontaneous circulation but has been found to have no effect on sur- vival to discharge.

U N S TA B L E B R A D Y C A R D I A

HisTory/Pe Symptomatic bradycardia, including hypotension, chest pain, altered mental status, or other signs of shock, is usually due to one of the following:

■ High vagal tone (cholinergic toxicity, inferior MI, digoxin toxicity). ■ Conduction abnormalities (sick sinus syndrome, AV-nodal blocks, diseases

such as Lyme carditis or multiple myeloma).

■ Medication effects (β-blockers, calcium channel blockers).

■ Transvenous pacing: Place a cordis central line and float a pacing wire to the heart. This takes about 15 minutes but provides the most defini- tive management until a permanent pacemaker can be placed.

■ Chemically: Dopamine or epinephrine.

■ Unfortunately, conditions such as β-blocker overdose lead to ⊝ chronot- ropy and ⊝ inotropy. In many cases, even pacing remains ineffective.

In the event of cardiac arrest, start CPR immediately using end-tidal CO2 to monitor quality. As chest compressions are being performed, begin bag-valve- mask ventilation, rapidly obtain vascular access (or interosseous access), and attach defibrillator pads to the patient. At the first rhythm check, you will find one of four electrical patterns: VF, pulseless VT, asystole, or pulseless electri- cal activity (PEA).

■ Asystole or PEA: CPR and epinephrine. No defibrillation, atropine, or pacing.

■ VF or pulseless VT:

■ H+ (acidosis) → reverse acidosis. ■ Hypo-/Hyperkalemia → either give or remove K+. ■ Hypoxia → 100% O2; secure/establish airway. ■ Hypovolemia → fluid replacement. ■ Thrombosis (PE, MI) → thrombolytics. ■ Tamponade → pericardiocentesis. ■ Tension pneumothorax → needle decompression. ■ Toxins → antidote (eg, hydroxocobalamin in cyanide toxicity).

TA C H Y C A R D I A

Tachycardia is defined as a heart rate > 100 bpm. Sinus tachycardia has an underlying cause that must be addressed (eg, dehydration, fever, pain) and will not be reviewed here in detail. The treatment of sinus tachycardia with rate-limiting agents is likely harmful, as the heart rate is compensatory to an underlying process and the compensatory mechanism is removed. Tachydys- rhythmias can result from:

■ Self-sustained conduction pathways (eg, SVT). ■ Multiple foci of automaticity (atrial flutter, AF). ■ Ventricular focus (VT).

TreaTmenT ■ Unstable tachycardia (eg, shortness of breath, chest pain, hypotension, ischemic ECG changes): Requires immediate synchronized cardioversion. ■ Stable tachycardia: Attempt vagal maneuvers first and then escalate ther-

Stable tachycardia: Attempt vagal maneuvers first and then escalate ther- apy as follows:

apy as follows: ■ Narrow, regular complex (eg, SVT): Adenosine. ■ Narrow, irregular complex (eg, AF): Rate control (metoprolol,

diltiazem).

■ Wide complex (eg, VT): Amiodarone. ■ All of the above rhythms can be electrically cardioverted if medical

therapy fails.

■ Special cases:

■ Do not cardiovert stable AF that has been present for > 48 hours. Obtain a transesophageal echocardiogram first to assess for an atrial thrombus. In torsades de pointes, give magnesium 1–2 g IV and provide either chemical or electrical overdrive pacing (may resolve with ↑ heart rate).

Also known as heart attack, MI usually presents with a primary complaint of chest pain that may radiate to the arm, neck, or back and that is often accom- panied by other symptoms, including shortness of breath, sweating, nausea and vomiting, palpitations, lightheadedness, and fatigue.

Diagnosis ■ Patients often appear anxious and/or have an impending feeling of doom. ■ ECG within 10 minutes of patient arrival to ED. The coronary artery involved produces a predictable pattern of electrical changes on an ECG (see the Cardiology chapter, Table 3-2, for a review of ECG changes with MI).

■ Further confirmatory blood work includes troponin and less often creatine kinase–MB fraction.

Toxicology

In general, there are several things you need to inquire about or obtain when treating a poisoned patient:

■ Time and type of ingestion. ■ Quantity and route of ingestion. ■ Comorbidities. ■ Vitals. ■ ECG. ■ Pupils, bowel sounds, skin exam, reflexes, and clonus. ■ Respiratory/heart rate, mental status.

Also bear in mind that while patients on the USMLE are always truthful, “real” patients may intentionally provide you with false information out of concern for the legal implications of substance abuse or if they overdosed for intentional self-harm.

T O X I D R O M E S

Table 4-4 lists symptoms and signs associated with common toxin-induced syndromes (“toxidromes”). Table 4-5 outlines several hypothetical scenarios involving toxidromes. Some additional toxicology pearls are as follows:

If a patient appears altered or intoxicated, don’t forget to check a blood sugar first!

■

■ Do not intubate patients with aspirin toxicity unless you absolutely must. Because the mechanical ventilator will never match these patients’ high minute volume, they will become more acidotic and die. In all overdoses, send an acetaminophen and aspirin level. In smoke inhalation, consider carbon monoxide and cyanide toxicity.

■ ■ ■ Serotonin syndrome kills (see Chapter 17). ■ Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can look like serotonin syndrome but develops more slowly (> 24 hours) and features rigidity rather than clonus (see Chapter 17).

■ Lithium toxicity may require dialysis. ■ Digoxin toxicity may require antibody fragment administration (digoxin

immune fab).

■ Charcoal is useful only in ingestions that occurred < 60 minutes ago. Multidose activated charcoal can be given for “gut dialysis” (removal of toxins from the enterohepatic circulation).

■ Whole bowel irrigation (similar to a colonoscopy prep) is indicated for “body packers” and for children with visible lead paint chips on x-ray, as well as for certain other ingestions.

Abdominal Pain

Pain is poorly localized by patients, and many conditions have symptoms that substantially overlap. Approximately 50% of patients presenting to the ED will not receive a diagnosis for their discomfort. Common abdominal condi- tions are discussed in Chapter 7 of this book. What follows is a discussion of conditions that require emergent treatment.

E P I G A S T R I C PA I N

Discomfort in this region may be due to intra-abdominal or intrathoracic pro- cesses. Broaden the differential appropriately in elderly persons, in women, and in patients with diabetes.

DifferenTial ■ Intra-abdominal processes: Pancreatitis (alcohol, gallstones), gastritis/

peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (heavy use of ethanol/NSAIDs).

■ Intrathoracic processes: Lower lobe pneumonia or an inferior MI.

vigneTTe

A 25-year-old man is pushed out of the back seat of a car in front of the ED before the car takes off speeding. The triage nurse finds the patient apneic and cyanotic with a thready pulse. He is tachycardic and hypoxic, and his pupils are constricted and minimally reactive. The patient has multiple scars on his arms and neck. Bag-valve-mask ventilations are provided.

A 17-year-old girl is brought to the ED by her parents for acting erratically. She is unable to give a history and is speaking nonsensically while picking at her clothing. Her pupils are 6 mm and reactive, and no nystagmus is present. She has no axillary moisture. Palpation of her abdomen reveals a suprapubic mass. Her reflexes are normal. She is tachycardic and has a temperature of 38.1°C (100.4°F).

A 42-year-old man is brought in for erratic behavior after partying all night. He is diaphoretic and must be restrained by security. A limited PE reveals mydriasis but no other significant abnormalities. After administration of lorazepam 2 mg IM, the patient becomes more cooperative and states that he has chest pain. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia with concerning ST-segment changes in the lateral leads.

A 40-year-old man finds his father pulseless in the garden shed with a letter by his side 2 days after his mother’s death. The son’s attempts at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compressions prove futile. Shortly thereafter, the son loses control of his bowel and bladder, develops rhinorrhea, and coughs up copious amounts of sputum. His HR is found to be 38 bpm.

Three young men are stopped near the Canadian border for driving 63 mph in a 65-mph zone. Before a search of the car can be conducted, one of the occupants eats an entire bag of their contraband. Shortly thereafter, he tells his friends that he is “freaking out.” While under arrest, the patient finds that parts of the police cruiser taste like his favorite fruit.

A 5-year-old boy is brought to the ED obtunded and tachypneic. His younger brother reports that the boy had been drinking “candy juice” that he found in the garage. A blood glucose level is normal.

EMERGENCY MEDICINE
======================================
ToxidroMe

This patient has likely overdosed on an opiate such as oxycodone or heroin and is suffering from opioid toxidrome. Given the scars on his arms (track marks) and neck (from “jugging”), he likely injected the opiate.

This patient appears to have ingested an anticholinergic, as evidenced by her dry skin, mydriasis, ↑ temperature, mental status changes, and urinary retention (distended bladder). The repetitive picking behavior is typical. ECG shows a QRS of 108 msec with a sloped R′ in aVR.

The sympathomimetic toxidrome can be triggered by drugs like PCP, methamphetamine, or, as in this case, cocaine. Chemical restraints are always preferred over physical ones, as physically restrained patients will remain agitated, fight the restraints, and develop hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis.

Exposure to cholinergic toxins results in SLUDGE (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diarrhea, GI distress, and Emesis). Exposure can be intentional but may also be accidental (as in carbamate [insecticide] exposure).

The patient is experiencing a hal- lucinogenic toxidrome. A variety of substances can induce this state, most commonly LSD and marijuana.

The sedative-hypnotic toxidrome is frequently seen in the ED, often in the form of benzodiazepine abuse or alcohol intoxication—or, in this case, ethylene glycol from antifreeze.

CHAPTER 4

TreaTMenT

Administer naloxone Long-acting opiates (eg, methadone) need repeat doses and hence will likely require admission Pulmonary edema may occur in some cases

Most patients require only observation and benzodiazepines for symptom control; improvement with physo- stigmine confirms the diagnosis Watch for QRS widening and subsequent seizures or arrhythmia; administer sodium bicarbonate to narrow the QRS as antihistamines have sodium channel-blocking properties similar to tricyclic antidepressants

Treat cocaine-associated chest pain as you would regular chest pain; 6% of cocaine chest pain cases will result in MI

The use of β-blockers to treat cocaine overdose remains controversial Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment in light of concern over unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation

The antidote is atropine In organophosphate poisoning, early administration of pralidoxime prevents aging of the chemical bond that inhibits cholinesterase

Although hemodynamic instability can occur with high drug doses, most patients just need control of agitation if present; give benzodiazepines as needed

Patients with sedative-hypnotic toxidrome often require only sup- portive care; however, in the setting of ethylene glycol ingestion, the patient may need fomepizole or ethanol and potentially dialysis

TreaTmenT ■ First step in managing both gastritis and peptic ulcers: Withdrawal/ removal of the offending agent (alcohol, NSAIDs). Both conditions are then treated conservatively with pain control and acid-lowering medica- tions such as H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors.

■ Pancreatitis requires analgesia and IV fluids. Patients can become severely dehydrated by pancreatic sequestration of fluids caused by its massive inflammation. As in gastritis and PUD, removal of the offending agent is necessary. The Ranson criteria allow the clinician to estimate the mortality of pancreatitis and help determine disposition.

ComPliCaTions In PUD, there is a risk of erosion into a gastric vessel, which can be life- threatening, or through the gastric wall, causing perforation.

■ Gastric hemorrhage is managed with upper endoscopy and clipping of the offending vessel.

■ Gastric perforation requires operative management.

R LQ PA I N

Can indicate a variety of conditions, especially in young women. The history often does not suffice to establish a diagnosis. The differential includes appen- dicitis, ovarian torsion, ruptured ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), renal calculus at the ureterovesi- cal junction.

Appendicitis ■ Has a bimodal distribution, affecting teenagers/young adults and those ∼60 years of age. Caused by a fecalith or occlusion of the appendix by swollen lymphoid tissue, leading to bacterial overgrowth. Left untreated, the infection may lead to rupture of the appendix.

■ Hx/PE: Classic signs and symptoms include pain in the periumbilical area that migrates to the RLQ, anorexia, and pain with jumping.

■ Dx: CT of the abdomen with IV contrast may quickly rule the diagnosis in or out. In children, ultrasound is preferred. MRI is a reasonable diagnostic modality in pregnancy. The Rovsing sign and the obturator sign are not sensitive or specific enough to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. ■ Tx: Antibiotics for GI flora and immediate surgical consultation.
======================================
L L Q PA I N

Diverticulitis ■

Inflammation and microperforation of the diverticula. One of the most common causes of left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain.

■ Hx/PE: Presents with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain of gradual onset. Patients may have a history of long-standing constipation prior to the pain but often complain of diarrhea while in pain. Exam ⊕ for LLQ tenderness with local peritoneal signs and often rebound.

■ DDx: Ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, perforating colon cancer, ectopic pregnancy, PID, ovarian torsion, ovarian cyst rupture.

■ Dx: Clinical diagnosis. CT scan is also used for diagnosis and aids in the identification of complications such as abscess and perforation (see Fig- ure 4-6). Do not perform colonoscopy on these patients while infection is

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Risk factors include age > 60, atherosclerosis, and smoking. Underlying mechanisms are as follows:

■ Weakness in the connective tissue of the tunica muscularis leads to bulg- ing out of the vessel, typically inferior to the origin for the renal arteries. ■ Wall stress is directly correlated to diameter (Laplace’s law); once a critical threshold is passed, the aneurysm will rupture. Rupture occurs into the retroperitoneal space, which can hold enough blood volume to cause the patient to exsanguinate within minutes.

HisTory/Pe ■ Presents with back pain/abdominal pain and syncope. ■ Leg pain/paresthesias 2° to occlusion of the artery of Adamkiewicz leads to

spinal cord infarcts.

Diagnosis ■ Pulsatile abdominal mass may be palpated or abdominal bruit may be

heard.

■ Ultrasound can assess for the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) but not rupture.

■ CT angiography of the abdomen/pelvis can detect rupture.

EMERGENCY MEDICINE

TreaTmenT ■ A ruptured AAA requires immediate resuscitation and emergent operative

repair.

■ Several large-bore (14- to 16-gauge) IVs should be inserted for resuscita- tion with blood products.

■ Reverse coagulopathy. ■ Do not manipulate BP with pressors (more pressure = more bleeding).

|_|

Sexual Assault

Begin by diagnosing and treating the patient’s physical and emotional inju- ries. Then collect legal evidence and document that evidence carefully. Your main concern should always be the well-being of the patient. Information should include the following:

■ Ascertain any injuries sustained during the assault. ■ Determine the risk of pregnancy. When was the last menstrual period?

Any birth control?

■ Find out where, when, and how the assault occurred. What happened during the assault? Determine the number of assailants; the use of force, weapons, objects, or restraints; which orifices were penetrated; and whether alcohol and/or drugs were involved.

■ Determine what happened after the assault. Are there any specific symp- toms or pains? Did the patient bathe, defecate, urinate, brush teeth, or change clothes? Has the patient had sexual intercourse in the last 72 hours?

Diagnosis ■ Assess for pelvic trauma that may require immediate intervention. ■ The collection of physical evidence (eg, debris, fingernail scrapings, dried secretions from the skin, pubic hairs) is often restricted to certified personnel.

■ Medically indicated testing includes a pregnancy test. ■ Nucleic acid amplification testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia; a wet mount and culture for trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and candidiasis; serology for syphilis; and hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HIV testing should be done later as they will not be positive early after exposure.
======================================
TreaTmenT ■ Treat traumatic injuries. ■

Infection prevention: Gonorrhea and chlamydia prophylaxis. HIV prophy- laxis in high-risk populations.

■ Pregnancy prevention: Administer ethinyl estradiol/norgestrel or levonorg- estrel. Offer counseling.

Animal and Insect Bites

Animal bites are a common reason patients present to the ED. The manage- ment of bite wounds requires a fine balance between reducing the risk of infection and achieving cosmesis.

■ Animal bites result in tissue destruction and inoculation of the wound with oral flora. Depending on the animal, the patient may be at risk for a variety of complications.

■ Dog bites produce large, torn wounds (bite and then shake/pull).

10/1/18 4:13 PM

EMERGENCY MEDICINE

■ Dogs have relatively clean mouths, so wounds may be sutured unless they are on the hand.

■ Cat bites cause deep penetrative wounds (high risk of anaerobic infection). ■ The kicking action of a cat’s hind legs may lead to inoculation with Bar-

tonella henselae.

TreaTmenT ■ Antibiotic prophylaxis should be provided even if the wound is not repaired. Amoxicillin/clavulanate or a similar agent that covers oral flora is preferred.

■ Wounds should be irrigated at high pressure with copious amounts of fluid. A wound may be loosely approximated rather than sutured tightly to prevent further wound contamination without creating an anaerobic environment. ■ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on the

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on the treatment of rabies are as follows:

treatment of rabies are as follows: ■

If the animal can be observed and does not display symptoms of rabies after 10 days, no vaccine is necessary. If the patient slept in the same room as a bat, vaccinate.

■ ■ There have been no documented cases of rabies transmitted by a

rodent (including squirrels).

■ Don’t forget to address wound care and tetanus status. ■ Give human rabies immunoglobin to all patients who were not previ- ously immunized. If possible, inject half around the bite and half IM elsewhere.

■ Vaccine should be administered in four doses on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. ■ Those previously vaccinated need only two vaccine doses. ■

Immunocompromised patients still get the fifth dose of the vaccine (as in the previous recommendations) at day 28.

■ Table 4-6 summarizes bite types (including human), associated infecting organisms, and appropriate treatment.
======================================
Tetanus

Trismus (ie, lockjaw), glottic spasm, and convulsive spasms caused by Clos- tridium tetani. High-risk patients include older adults (due to inadequate immunization), IV drug users, and skin ulcer patients.

■ The tetanus toxin affects modulatory motor neurons that normally secrete gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to suppress motor impulses. As GABA levels in the synaptic cleft decline, even small, accidental impulses will produce muscle contractions. This results in a generalized tonic state in which all striated muscles begin to contract.

■ Because the posterior muscle groups of the torso are stronger than the anterior groups, patients in the most advanced disease states are often arched with contracted arms (biceps stronger than triceps). This is called opisthotonos.

■ Although the heart muscle is not affected, tetanus may lead to respiratory arrest, hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis, and subsequent death.

TreaTmenT ■ Benzodiazepines to control muscle spasms; neuromuscular blockade if

needed to control the airway.

■ Metronidazole is the antibiotic of choice. ■ Administer tetanus immune globulin (TIG) and/or adsorbed tetanus and

diphtheria toxoid vaccine as indicated in Table 4-7.

Patients who are presensitized to certain antigens may develop a significant type I hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction on exposure. True anaphylaxis is associated with significant mortality, usually from airway occlusion rather than from hypotension (which is easily treated with IV fluids and pressors).

Eikenella corrodens, the most likely pathogen, is common in human bite infections that are sustained in closed-fist injuries. Treat with amoxicillin/clavulanate.

IgE-mediated cytokine release in response to an antigen triggers a variety of reactions. The predominant cytokine is IL-4 causing a release of hista- mine. Histamine can also be released independent of IgE by direct mast cell stimulation (eg, morphine, IV contrast dye). In addition to vasodilation, the capillary bed becomes leaky and significant edema ensues. Edema may occur superficially (facial swelling), in the gut (leading to nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain), and in the airway (placing the patient at risk for airway occlusion). The latter is exacerbated by induced bronchospasm as well as bronchorrhea.

■ Anaphylaxis also leads to systemic vasodilation, resulting in hypotension despite high cardiac output (distributive shock).

Diagnosis A clinical diagnosis. Patients often present with significant hives and obvious swelling along with a history of allergic reactions. To meet the diagnostic cri- teria for anaphylaxis, two organ systems must be involved (eg, hives and abdominal pain or vomiting). No lab tests or imaging studies aid in diagnosis.

TreaTmenT Several treatment modalities are available for patients with an allergic reac- tion or anaphylaxis:

■ Epinephrine: Can be given any route. IM is the fastest to administer. ■ Histamine blockade (diphenhydramine for H1 blockade; famotidine for H2

blockade).

■ Steroids. ■ Nebulized albuterol (for wheezing). ■ Early intubation if necessary.

|_|

Angioedema

There are two types of angioedema: hereditary and acquired (eg, related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs]). The condition becomes an emergency if it involves the tongue or upper airway (see Figure 4-7). Underlying mechanisms include the following:

■ The complement system is a cascade that ends in the formation of the “membrane attack complex,” which disrupts the cell walls of pathogens. C1 is the first step in this cascade. In hereditary angioedema, C1 is not inhibited, so it may inappropriately trigger the cascade.

■ An autosomal dominant mutation leads to a deficiency of C1 esterase (aka C1 inhibitor). C1 then becomes overactive, leading to the production of kal- likrein. Subsequently, kininogen and therefore bradykinin levels can be ↑. ■ Bradykinin enhances vascular permeability, which in turn produces signif-

icant tissue edema. ACEIs also ↑ bradykinin.

Diagnosis ■ Clinical. ■ C1 esterase inhibitor levels confirm the diagnosis but are not available for

immediate decision making in the ED.

Frostbite ■ Cold injury with pallor and loss of cold sensation resulting from exposure to cold air or direct contact with cold materials. Nonviable structures demarcate and slough off. May be superficial or deep: ■ Superficial: Injury to cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Skin is soft under a frozen surface. Large, clear, fluid-filled vesicles develop within 2 days (indicating a good prognosis); sloughing leaves new skin that is pink and hypersensitive.

■ Deep: Injury to the above tissues plus deep structures (muscle, bone). Skin is hard under a frozen surface.

■ Tx: Rapidly rewarming once refreezing can be prevented. Circulating water at 40°C (104°F); wound care; tetanus prophylaxis.

Hypothermia Defined as a core body temperature of < 35°C (< 95°F). Caused by environ- mental exposure, alcohol ingestion, drugs (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, nar- cotics), hypoglycemia, CNS or hypothalamic dysfunction (via loss of stimulus of shivering response and adrenal activity), hypothyroidism, skin disorders, and sepsis.

Burns

Burn victims pose highly complex challenges. Not only are they prone to dehydration, hypothermia, and infection from their compromised skin bar- rier, but they are also at risk for airway compromise (inhalational burn), trauma (when attempting to escape fire), and toxicity from inhaled gases (pri- marily carbon monoxide and cyanide).

oral burns, carbonaceous sputum, or a hoarse voice, intubate early. ■ Gauge the body surface area (BSA) involved. Observe the rule of 9’s:

■ Adults: 9% BSA for the head and each arm; 18% BSA for the back torso, the front torso, and each leg.

■ Children: 9% BSA for each arm; 18% BSA for the head, back torso, and front torso; and 14% BSA for each leg.

■ Determine the depth of the burn (see Table 4-8 and Figure 4-9).
======================================
TreaTmenT ■ Prehospital treatment:

■ Administer IV fluids and high-flow O2. ■ Remove the patient’s clothes and cover with clean sheets or dressings. ■ Give pain medications.

■ In-hospital treatment:

■ Early airway control is critical. ■ Fluid resuscitation: Appropriate for patients with > 20% BSA second- degree burns. Give 4 cc/kg per % total BSA (Parkland formula) over 24 hours—the first half over the first 8 hours and the second half over the next 16 hours. Keep in mind that the clock starts at the time of the burn. Don’t fall behind with fluid resuscitation; you will never catch up in these patients.

Electrical Injuries

Electrical current flows most easily through tissues of low resistance, such as nerves, blood vessels, mucous membranes, and muscles. The current pathway determines which organs are affected. External injuries do not predict inter- nal injuries.

HisTory/Pe Symptoms vary with the nature of the current.

■ Alternating current (household and commercial):

■ Associated with explosive exit wounds (see Figure 4-10). ■ Effects are worse with alternating current than with direct current at

the same voltage.

■ VF is common.

■ Direct current (industrial, batteries, lightning):

■ Causes discrete exit wounds. ■ Asystole is common.

Corneal Abrasion ■ Hx/PE: Presents with pain out of proportion to the exam as well as with a

foreign-body sensation and photophobia.

■ Dx: Fluorescein staining (cobalt-blue light source via slit-lamp or Wood lamp examination) reveals an abraded area.

■ Tx: Treat with topical broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, gentamicin, sulfa- cetamide, bacitracin), tetanus prophylaxis, and oral analgesics.

Ruptured Globe ■ Hx/PE: Presents with trauma and loss of vision. Exam may reveal a vitre- ous humor leak leading to a teardrop-shaped pupil and a marked ↓ in visual acuity. Seidel test: Apply fluorescein to the cornea; if there is cascad- ing of fluid like a waterfall, then globe perforation has occurred.

■ Dx: Diagnosis can often be made only by clinical means. Ocular ultra- sound or tonometry will worsen the injury.

■ Tx: Manage with a rigid eye shield to prevent pressure on the globe. An immediate ophthalmologic consultation is necessary.

Allergic Conjunctivitis ■

Intensely pruritic, watery eyes. Most commonly affects males with a family history of atopy.

■ Hx/PE/Dx: Look for diffuse conjunctival injection with normal visual acu- ity. Lid edema and cobblestone papillae may be seen under the upper lid. ■ Tx: Treat with topical antihistamine/vasoconstrictor preparations such as

naphazoline/pheniramine. Cool compresses are also of benefit.

Bacterial Conjunctivitis ■ Painful, red eye that is usually unilateral. Causative organisms include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia tra- chomatis (in newborns and sexually active adults).

■ Hx/PE: Presents with photophobia, a gritty foreign-body sensation, and a purulent exudate.

■ Dx: Diffuse conjunctival injection with normal visual acuity. Bacteria can be seen on Gram stain.

■ Tx: Treat staphylococcal and streptococcal infection with topical 10% sul- facetamide or aminoglycoside. For suspected N gonorrhoeae, IV ceftriax- one and topical erythromycin or tetracycline (if left untreated, can lead to blindness and sepsis). PO doxycycline or PO/topical erythromycin is appropriate for chlamydial infection (if left untreated, can lead to corneal scarring and/or C trachomatis pneumonia). Warm compresses and fre- quent flushes are also of benefit.

Viral Conjunctivitis (“Pink Eye”) ■ Hx/PE: Presents as an irritated, red eye with watery discharge and crust- ing. Frequently bilateral, and often occurs in conjunction with cold symp- toms (eg, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough).

■ Dx: Diffuse conjunctival injection with normal vision and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Multiple superficial punctate corneal lesions are seen on fluorescein staining.

■ Tx: Generally no treatment is necessary.

Chemical Conjunctivitis ■ Caused by acid or alkali exposure. ■ Dx: Determine pH from litmus paper. Coagulation necrosis is associated

Dental Emergencies

D E N TA L A V U L S I O N

Fractures of the teeth are classified by the deepest layer violated (enamel, dentin, or pulp). They should be evaluated by a dentist within 24 hours. Complete removal of the tooth from its socket, or an avulsion, requires reim- plantation within 2–3 hours of injury.

TreaTmenT ■ Wash the tooth in clean water to remove debris. Do not scrub; doing so will also remove the periodontal ligaments. Then attempt to reimplant the tooth in its socket. If this is not possible (eg, if the tooth doesn’t fit or the patient is uncon- scious and likely to swallow it), place the tooth in an isotonic solution such as sterile saline or milk. There are also commercially available solutions for this purpose.

■ Further treatment depends on the amount of time the tooth has been “dry.” The patient should be referred to a dentist or an oral surgeon.

ENDOCRINOLOGY

Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes mellitus (DM) results from ↓ insulin secretion (type 1) or from tis- sue resistance to insulin (type 2), leading to hyperglycemia (see Table 5-1). Complications include microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, neu- ropathy) and macrovascular disease (atherosclerosis).

T Y P E 1 D I A B E T E S M E L L I T U S

Type 1 DM is caused by immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency. It accounts for < 10% of all cases of DM.

History/PE ■ Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia—the 3 P’s of diabetes—can be severe. Patients may also have rapid or unexplained weight loss, blurry vision, or recurrent infections (eg, candidiasis). ■ Patients are often young (< 30 years).

DiffErEntial Pancreatic disease (eg, chronic pancreatitis), glucagonoma, Cushing disease, iatrogenic factors (eg, high-dose glucocorticoids), gestational diabetes, diabe- tes insipidus.

T A B L E 5 - 1 . Type 1 vs Type 2 DM
======================================
10/1/18 4:15 PM

10/1/18 4:15 PM

ENDOCRINOLOGY

Diagnosis Requires at least one of the following:

■ A random plasma glucose concentration of ≥ 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms of diabetes.

■ Two fasting plasma glucose levels of ≥ 126 mg/dL on more than one occasion.

■ A 2-hour postprandial glucose level of ≥ 200 mg/dL after a 75-g oral glu- cose tolerance test on two separate occasions.

■ A hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 6.5%.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: Start insulin (see Table 5-2). Both basal and bolus insulin are

required.

■ Most patients with type 1 DM are on a multiple-daily-injection (MDI) reg- imen consisting of a premeal short-acting insulin (eg, lispro or aspart) and a bedtime long-acting insulin (glargine) or twice-daily neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) or detemir.

■ Consider screening newly diagnosed type 1 diabetics for other autoim- mune diseases such as thyroid disease or celiac disease.

T Y P E 2 D I A B E T E S M E L L I T U S

Common disorder with two etiologies: insufficient insulin secretion and ↑ insu- lin resistance (see Table 5-1). Prevalence is rising with increasing rates of obesity.

■ Characterized by impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and exces-

sive hepatic glucose production. In its early stages, glucose tolerance remains near normal despite insulin resistance. After an initial period of insulin resistance and ↑ insulin secretion, pancreatic β-cell function falters and fails to meet peripheral demand.

ENDOCRINOLOGY

History/PE ■ Symptoms are similar to those of type 1 DM. Because of the insidious onset of hyperglycemia, patients may be asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

■ ↑ BMI or strong family history of DM.

DiffErEntial ■ Pancreatic insufficiency: Chronic pancreatitis, hemosiderosis, subtotal

pancreatectomy, hemochromatosis.

■ Endocrinopathies: Cushing syndrome, acromegaly, glucagonoma, gesta- tional diabetes, diabetes insipidus.

■ Drugs: Glucocorticoids, thiazides, niacin, HIV protease inhibitors, tacrolimus.

Diagnosis Similar to that of type 1 DM. Consider screening asymptomatic adults with a BMI > 25 or strong family history of DM.

trEatmEnt ■ First line: Lifestyle changes are first-line treatment. Diet, weight loss, and exercise are critical in that they ↑ insulin sensitivity and ↓ blood glucose levels. Goal HbA1c for most patients is < 7%.

■ Start oral therapy in patients whose diabetes is not controlled by weight

loss, diet, or exercise. Best initial medical therapy is metformin. If HbA1c is still elevated, add a second medication (see Table 5-3). If the patient continues to have inadequate control on oral antidiabetic drugs, insulin is either added to the oral regimen or used to replace it. Dosing depends on the type of insulin (see Table 5-2). Consider long- acting insulin (detemir or glargine) if insulin is added to oral hypoglyce- mic therapy (given in the morning or at bedtime).

■ ■

■ For those who require more intense therapy, a split/mixed regimen of reg- ular or short-acting and NPH or glargine insulin may be used (usually a basal-bolus regimen of glargine with premeal aspart or lispro).

■ Long-term management (see next section) includes monitoring blood glu- cose and checking a fasting glucose level once a day; otherwise, it is simi- lar to that of type 1 DM.

DM is closely linked to multiple vascular complications, many of which can be prevented with improved glycemic control (see Table 5-4).

■ Check HbA1c every 3 months (goal HbA1c < 7%). ■ Order yearly urine microalbumin to look for nephropathy. ■

Instruct patients to inspect feet daily; obtain yearly foot exam with micro- filament sensation testing.

■ Conduct yearly dilated eye exam to look for retinopathy. ■ Manage CAD risk factors.

■ Encourage smoking cessation. ■ Keep BP below 130/80 mm Hg. First-line treatment of hypertension is angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) such as lisino- pril or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which help protect against nephropathy.

■ Treat hyperlipidemia with statins.

■ Counsel on consistent carbohydrate intake; refer to dietician if necessary.

More common in older women; they can be benign or malignant. Hyper- functioning (“hot”) nodules are rarely malignancy; therefore, checking TSH levels is the first step in evaluation. Risk factors for malignancy include a his- tory of head or neck irradiation, family or personal history of thyroid disease or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), and a rapidly growing nodule.

History/PE ■ May be asymptomatic or present as a single firm, palpable nodule. ■ Often found incidentally on radiologic studies that are ordered for other

purposes.

■ Cervical lymphadenopathy, dysphagia, dyspnea and hoarseness should raise concern.

DiffErEntial ■ The differential for thyroid nodules includes:

■ Benign: Adenomatous thyroid nodule; thyroglossal duct cyst. ■ Malignant: 1° thyroid cancer, thyroid lymphoma, metastatic cancer.

■ Subtypes of malignant lesions include:

■ Papillary: Most common; spreads lymphatically; has an excellent prog- nosis, with a 10-year survival rate of > 95%.

■ Follicular: The second most common subtype; spreads locally and hematogenously. Can metastasize to the bone and lungs. Has a 10-year survival rate of ∼ 90%.

■ Medullary: A tumor of parafollicular C cells. May secrete calcitonin. 15% familial or associated with MEN 2A or 2B.

■ Anaplastic: Undifferentiated. Has a poor prognosis; usually occurs in older patients.
======================================
Diagnosis ■ Best initial test: TSH.

■ Normal or high: Obtain an ultrasound to select a nodule for biopsy with FNA—the most accurate method for evaluating thyroid nodules. ■ Low: Conduct an RAI uptake and scan to identify whether the nodule is functioning (“hot”) or nonfunctioning (“cold”). Functioning nodules are almost always benign, whereas those that are nonfunctioning are associated with a 15% chance of malignancy. Cold nodules should undergo biopsy with FNA.

■ Figure 5-3 outlines subsequent steps in the evaluation and treatment of thyroid nodules.

trEatmEnt Contingent on FNA or RAI uptake results (see Figure 5-3):

■ Follicular cells or malignancy: Surgery. ■ Benign: Serial follow-up. ■ Indeterminate: Repeat FNA under ultrasound guidance. ■ Hot nodules: Ablation/resection or medical management.

History/PE Many patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms range from mild nausea to obtundation, and may include fatigue, constipation, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain.

DiffErEntial ■ 1° hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid adenoma or multiglandular disease). ■ Vitamin D excess, thiazides, sarcoidosis. ■ Malignancy: Parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related protein (lung and breast

cancers are most common), bony metastases.

Diagnosis ■ Best initial test: PTH level.

■ ↑ PTH with ↑ Ca indicates 1° hyperparathyroidism. ■ Normal or ↓ PTH with ↑ Ca indicates 2° cause such as malignancy. ■ Other tests to consider: Serum protein electrophoresis, vitamin D levels,

CXR.

History/PE Commonly asymptomatic. Patients may present with vertebral compression fractures (resulting in loss of height and progressive thoracic kyphosis), or wrist or hip fracture following minimal trauma.

DiffErEntial Osteomalacia (inadequate bone mineralization), hyperparathyroidism, multi- ple myeloma, metastatic carcinoma (pathologic fracture).

Diagnosis ■ All women > 65 years of age, as well as those 40–60 years of age with at least one risk factor for osteoporotic fractures after menopause, should be screened with a DEXA scan of the spine and hip. DEXA results are cate- gorized as follows: ■ T-score > −1.0: Normal. ■ T-score −1.0 to −2.5: Osteopenia (“low bone density”). ■ T-score < −2.5: Osteoporosis. ■ T-score < −2.5 with a fracture: Severe osteoporosis.

■ Rule out 2° causes, including smoking, alcoholism, renal failure, hyper- thyroidism, multiple myeloma, 1° hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D defi- ciency, hypercortisolism, heparin use, and long-term steroid use.

trEatmEnt ■ All postmenopausal women should be counseled on lifestyle changes including calcium/vitamin D supplementation, weight-bearing exercise, and smoking cessation.

■ Treat when the T-score is < −2.5 or when the T-score is < −1.0 in a patient with high risk factors for osteoporotic fractures.

■ First line: Bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate), which inhibit osteoclastic activity.

■ Second line: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as ral- oxifene, which ↑ bone mineral density and ↓ bone resorption; deno- sumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor; and teriparatide (PTH analog) or calcitonin.

■ A DEXA scan should be repeated 1–2 years after the initiation of drug therapy. If the T-score is found to have worsened, combination therapy (eg, a SERM and a bisphosphonate) or a change in therapy should be ini- tiated, with consideration given to ruling out 2° causes.

BB casting syndrome (Hypercortisolism)
======================================
Cushing Syndrome (Hypercortisolism)

Results from excess levels of exogenously administered glucocorticoids or endogenous overproduction of cortisol. The most common cause is iatrogenic Cushing syndrome due to exogenous glucocorticoids. The second most com- mon form is Cushing disease, which results from pituitary hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

History/PE ■ Presents with skin atrophy and proximal muscle weakness. Areas of fat dis- tribution (moon face, buffalo hump) are characteristic (see Figure 5-5). ■ Psychiatric disturbances, hypertension, hyperglycemia, oligomenorrhea,

growth retardation, and hirsutism.

■ Muscle wasting, easy bruising, and striae.

DiffErEntial DM, chronic alcoholism, depression, obesity due to other causes, long-term steroid use, adrenogenital syndrome, acute stress.

Diagnosis ■ Best initial test: Overnight dexamethasone test or measurement of urinary or salivary cortisol to confirm the diagnosis of cortisol excess. See Figure 5-6. ■ The overnight test consists of administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone at 11 pm and measurement of serum cortisol at 8 am the next morning. An 8 am serum cortisol value of < 2 μg/dL is normal in most patients. If hypercortisolism, measure ACTH level to determine whether ACTH is independent or dependent. See Table 5-7.

■ For ACTH-independent hypercortisolism (↓ ACTH), order abdominal CT to look for adrenal pathology.

■ For ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism (↑ ACTH), determine location by

performing a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. ■ ■

If the high-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH, the origin is pituitary. If ACTH is not suppressed, the origin is ectopic production of ACTH.

trEatmEnt ■ Patients with Cushing disease are usually treated by transsphenoidal

microsurgical excision of the pituitary adenomas.

and improved with bed rest; generalized weakness, weight loss. ■ Additional features (more common in 1° adrenal insufficiency):

■ Hypotension; postural dizziness or syncope due to volume depletion resulting from aldosterone deficiency.

■ Electrolyte abnormalities: Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia (mild hyper- chloremic acidosis) due to mineralocorticoid deficiency (60–65% of patients); salt craving in some patients.

■ Hyperpigmentation due to production of proopiomelanocortin (brown- ish discoloration); occurs primarily with 1° adrenal insufficiency (see Figure 5-7).

DiffErEntial ■ 1° adrenal insufficiency: Adrenal failure due to autoimmune disease (idio- pathic), metastatic tumors, hemorrhagic infarction (from coagulopathy or septicemia), adrenalectomy, or granulomatous disease (TB, sarcoid).

■ 2° adrenal insufficiency: Results from ↓ ACTH production from the pitu- itary. May be due to withdrawal of exogenous steroids or hypothalamic/ pituitary pathology (tumor, infarct, trauma, infection, iatrogenic).

Diagnosis ■ Measure 8 am serum cortisol and plasma ACTH to confirm low serum cortisol levels. Then check a cosyntropin stimulation test, which measures cortisol before and after administration of synthetic ACTH. ■ An am serum cortisol < 5 μg/dL or a serum cortisol < 20 μg/dL after

an ACTH stimulation test makes the diagnosis more likely.

If the cause is unclear, the plasma ACTH level distinguishes 1° from 2° adrenal failure (see Table 5-8).
======================================
trEatmEnt ■ First line: For stable patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency, steroids

(hydrocortisone or prednisone).

■ Add fludrocortisone for patients with persistent orthostatic hypotension, hyponatremia, or hyperkalemia.

■ Patients should be instructed to take ↑ doses (stress doses) of glucocorti- coid during times of stress or illness.
