USING THIS BOOK

This work is intended as a review for students during their preclinical years and while preparing for examinations, such as the USMLE . To this effect, the organization of this book follows that of most primary texts in the field and parallels the syllabus used in pathophysiology courses in medical schools throughout the United States. Ample space is provided for students to make notes during course study and while viewing the online videos that cover each section of the text (www.pathoma.com).

We recommend that students use Fundamentals of Pathology during their medical courses, taking notes in the margin as pertinent topics are covered. When exam time comes around, these notes will likely be invaluable.

For examination preparation, we suggest students read the material first, then listen to the online lecture, and then reread the material to develop a solid grasp of each topic. One should not become disheartened if they are not able to retain all the information contained herein. This deceptively slim volume covers a tremendous amount of material, and repetition will be a key aid as you progress in your studies.

An effort has been made to emphasize concepts and principles over random facts, the forest rather than the trees. Attention to the same by the student will provide a deeper, more meaningful understanding of human disease. We must always remind ourselves that ultimately our goal is to learn, to share, and to serve. Fundamentals of Pathology was developed with this goal in mind.

TO MY PARENTS AND EACH OF MY TEACHERS - YOUR SACRIFICE FORMS THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH OUR WORK IS BUILT
======================================
Growth Adaptations, Cellular Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death Injury, and Cell Death

GROWTH ADAPTATIONS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. An organ is in homeostasis with the physiologic stress placed on it. B. An increase, decrease, or change in stress on an organ can result in growth

adaptations.

IL HYPERPLASIA AND HYPERTROPHY

A. An increase in stress leads to an increase in organ size.

1. Occurs via an increase in the size (hypertrophy) and/or the number (hyperplasia) of cells

B. Hypertrophy involves gene activation, protein synthesis, and production of organelles.

C. Hyperplasia involves the production of new cells from stem cells. D. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy generally occur together (e.g., uterus during

pregnancy).

1. Permanent tissues (e.g., cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and nerve), however, cannot make new cells and undergo hypertrophy only.

2. For example, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophy, not hyperplasia, in response to systemic hypertension (Fig. 1.1).

E. Pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) can progress to dysplasia and, eventually, cancer.

1. A notable exception is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which does not increase the risk for prostate cancer.

III. ATROPHY

A. A decrease in stress (e.g., decreased hormonal stimulation, disuse, or decreased nutrients/blood supply) leads to a decrease in organ size (atrophy). 1. Occurs via a decrease in the size and number of cells

B. Decrease in cell number occurs via apoptosis. C. Decrease in cell size occurs via ubiquitin-proteosome degradation of the

cytoskeleton and autophagy of cellular components.

1. In ubiquitin-proteosome degradation, intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton are "tagged" with ubiquitin and destroyed by proteosomes.

2. Autophagy of cellular components involves generation of autophagic vacuoles. These vacuoles fuse with lysosomes whose hydrolytic enzymes breakdown cellular components.

IV. METAPLASIA

A. A change in stress on an organ leads to a change in cell type (metaplasia).

1. Most commonly involves change of one type of surface epithelium (squamous, columnar, or urothelial) to another

2. Metaplastic cells are better able to handle the new stress.

B. Barrett esophagus is a classic example.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Esophagus is normally lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium (suited to handle friction of a food bolus).

2. Acid reflux from the stomach causes metaplasia to nonciliated, mucin-producing columnar cells (better able to handle the stress of acid, Fig. 1.2).

C. Metaplasia occurs via reprogramming of stem cells, which then produce the new cell

type. 1. Metaplasia is reversible, in theory, with removal of the driving stressor. 2. For example, treatment of gastroesophageal reflux may reverse Barrett

esophagus.

D. Under persistent stress, metaplasia can progress to dysplasia and eventually result in

cancer. 1. For example, Barrett esophagus may progress to adenocarcinoma of the

esophagus.

2. A notable exception is apocrine metaplasia of breast, which carries no increased risk for cancer.

E. Vitamin A deficiency can also result in metaplasia.

1. Vitamin A is necessary for differentiation of specialized epithelial surfaces such

as the conjunctiva covering the eye. In vitamin A deficiency, the thin squamous lining of the conjunctiva undergoes metaplasia into stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium. This change is called keratomalacia (Fig. 1.3).

2.

F. Mesenchymal (connective) tissues can also undergo metaplasia.

1. A classic example is myositis ossificans in which connective tissue within muscle changes to bone during healing after trauma (Fig. 1.4).

V DYSPLASIA .

A. Disordered cellular growth B. Most often refers to proliferation of precancerous cells

1. For example, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) represents dysplasia and is a precursor to cervical cancer.

C. Often arises from longstanding pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) or metaplasia (e.g., Barrett esophagus)

D. Dysplasia is reversible, in theory, with alleviation of inciting stress. 1. If stress persists, dysplasia progresses to carcinoma (irreversible).

VI APLASIA AND HYPOPLASIA .

A. Aplasia is failure of cell production during embryogenesis (e.g., unilateral renal agenesis).

B. Hypoplasia is a decrease in cell production during embryogenesis, resulting in a relatively small organ (e.g., streak ovary in Turner syndrome).

Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death
======================================
CELLULAR INJURY

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Cellular injury occurs when a stress exceeds the cell's ability to adapt. B. The likelihood of injury depends on the type of stress, its severity, and the type of cell

affected. 1. Neurons are highly susceptible to ischemic injury; whereas, skeletal muscle is

relatively more resistant.

2. Slowly developing ischemia (e.g., renal artery atherosclerosis) results in atrophy;

whereas, acute ischemia (e.g., renal artery embolus) results in injury. C. Common causes of cellular injury include inflammation, nutritional deficiency or

excess, hypoxia, trauma, and genetic mutations.

II. HYPOXIA

A. Low oxygen delivery to tissue; important cause of cellular injury

1. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain of oxidative phosphorylation.

2. Decreased oxygen impairs oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased ATP production.

3. Lack of ATP (essential energy source) leads to cellular injury.

B. Causes of hypoxia include ischemia, hypoxemia, and decreased O2-carrying capacity

of blood.

C. Ischemia is decreased blood flow through an organ. Arises with

1. Decreased arterial perfusion (e.g., atherosclerosis) 2. Decreased venous drainage (e.g., Budd-Chiari syndrome) 3. Shock - generalized hypotension resulting in poor tissue perfusion

D. Hypoxemia is a low partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (Pao2 < 60 mm Hg, Sao2 <

90%). Arises with 1. High altitude - Decreased barometric pressure results in decreased PAo2• 2. Hypoventilation - Increased PAco2 results in decreased PAo2 3. Diffusion defect - PAo2 not able to push as much O2 into the blood due to a thicker

diffusion barrier (e.g., interstitial pulmonary fibrosis)

4. V/Q mismatch - Blood bypasses oxygenated lung (circulation problem, e.g., right- to-left shunt), or oxygenated air cannot reach blood (ventilation problem, e.g., atelectasis).

E. Decreased O2-carrying capacity arises with hemoglobin (Hb) loss or dysfunction.

Examples include 1. Anemia (decrease in RBC mass)-Pao normal; Sao normal 2. Carbon monoxide poisoning

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

i. CO binds hemoglobin more avidly than oxygen-Pao2 normal; Sao2 decreased

ii. Exposures include smoke from fires and exhaust from cars or gas heaters. iii. Classic finding is cherry-red appearance of skin. iv. Early sign of exposure is headache; significant exposure leads to coma and

death.

3. Methemoglobinemia

Iron in heme is oxidized to Fe3+, which cannot bind oxygen-Pao2 normal; Sao2 decreased

ii. Seen with oxidant stress (e.g., sulfa and nitrate drugs) or in newborns iii. Classic finding is cyanosis with chocolate-colored blood. iv. Treatment is intravenous methylene blue, which helps reduce Fe2+ back to

Fe2+state.
======================================
III. REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE CELLULAR INJURY

A. Hypoxia impairs oxidative phosphorylation resulting in decreased ATP. B. Low ATP disrupts key cellular functions including

1. Na+- K+pump, resulting in sodium and water buildup in the cell 2. Ca 2+pump, resulting in Ca2 3. Aerobic glycolysis, resulting in a switch to anaerobic glycolysis. Lactic acid buildup results in low pH, which denatures proteins and precipitates DNA.

C. The initial phase of injury is reversible. The hallmark of reversible injury is cellular

swelling. 1. Cytosol swelling results in loss of microvilli and membrane blebbing. 2. Swelling of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) results in dissociation of

ribosomes and decreased protein synthesis.

D. Eventually, the damage becomes irreversible. The hallmark of irreversible injury is

membrane damage. 1. Plasma membrane damage results in

i. Cytosolic enzymes leaking into the serum (e.g., cardiac troponin) ii. Additional calcium entering into the cell 2. Mitochondrial membrane damage results in

i. Loss of the electron transport chain (inner mitochondrial membrane) ii. Cytochrome c leaking into cytosol (activates apoptosis)

3. Lysosome membrane damage results in hydrolytic enzymes leaking into the cytosol, which, in turn, are activated by the high intracellular calcium.

E. The end result of irreversible injury is cell death.

Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death

CELL DEATH

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. The morphologic hallmark of cell death is loss of the nucleus, which occurs via nuclear condensation (pyknosis), fragmentation (karyorrhexis), and dissolution (karyolysis).

B. The two mechanisms of cell death are necrosis and apoptosis.

II. NECROSIS

A. Death of large groups of cells followed by acute inflammation B. Due to some underlying pathologic process; never physiologic C. Divided into several types based on gross features
======================================
III. GROSS PATTERNS OF NECROSIS

A. Coagulative necrosis

1. Necrotic tissue that remains firm (Fig. 1.5A); cell shape and organ structure are preserved by coagulation of proteins, but the nucleus disappears (Fig. 1.5B).

2. Characteristic of ischemic infarction of any organ except the brain 3. Area of infarcted tissue is often wedge-shaped (pointing to focus of vascular

occlusion) and pale.

4. Red infarction arises if blood re-enters a loosely organized tissue (e.g., pulmonary or testicular infarction, Fig. 1.6).

B. Liquefactive necrosis

1. Necrotic tissue that becomes liquefied; enzymatic lysis of cells and protein results

in liquefaction. 2. Characteristic of

i. Brain infarction - Proteolytic enzymes from microglial cells liquefy the brain.

ii. Abscess - Proteolytic enzymes from neutrophils liquefy tissue. iii. Pancreatitis - Proteolytic enzymes from pancreas liquefy parenchyma.

C. Gangrenous necrosis

1. Coagulative necrosis that resembles mummified tissue (dry gangrene, Fig. 1.7) 2. Characteristic of ischemia of lower limb and GI tract 3.

If superimposed infection of dead tissues occurs, then liquefactive necrosis ensues (wet gangrene).

D. Caseous necrosis

1. Soft and friable necrotic tissue with "cottage cheese-like" appearance (Fig. 1.8) 2. Combination of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis 3. Characteristic of granulomatous inflammation due to tuberculous or fungal

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

E. Fat necrosis

1. Necrotic adipose tissue with chalky-white appearance due to deposition of calcium (Fig. 1.9)

2. Characteristic of trauma to fat (e.g., breast) and pancreatitis-mediated damage of peripancreatic fat

3. Fatty acids released by trauma (e.g., to breast) or lipase (e.g., pancreatitis) join

with calcium via a process called saponification. i. Saponification is an example of dystrophic calcification in which calcium deposits on dead tissues. In dystrophic calcification, the necrotic tissue acts as a nidus for calcification in the setting of normal serum calcium and phosphate.

ii. Metastatic calcification, as opposed to dystrophic calcification, occurs when high serum calcium or phosphate levels lead to calcium deposition in normal tissues (e.g., hyperparathyroidism leading to nephrocalcinosis).

F. Fibrinoid necrosis

1. Necrotic damage to blood vessel wall 2. Leaking of proteins (including fibrin) into vessel wall results in bright pink

staining of the wall microscopically (Fig. 1.10).

3. Characteristic of malignant hypertension and vasculitis
======================================
IV.APOPTOSIS

A. Energy (ATP)-dependent, genetically programmed cell death involving single cells or small groups of cells. Examples include

1. Endometrial shedding during menstrual cycle 2. Removal of cells during embryogenesis 3. CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of virally infected cells

B. Morphology

1. Dying cell shrinks, leading cytoplasm to become more eosinophilic (pink, Fig. l.ll). 2. Nucleus condenses and fragments in an organized manner. 3. Apoptotic bodies fall from the cell and are removed by macrophages; apoptosis is

not followed by inflammation.

C. Apoptosis is mediated by caspases that activate proteases and endonucleases.

1. Proteases break down the cytoskeleton. 2. Endonucleases break down DNA. D. Caspases are activated by multiple pathways.

1. Intrinsic mitochondrial pathway

i. Cellular injury, DNA damage, or decreased hormonal stimulation leads to inactivation of Bcl2.

ii. Lack of Bcl2 allows cytochrome c to leak from the inner mitochondrial matrix into the cytoplasm and activate caspases.

Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death

2. Extrinsic receptor-ligand pathway

FAS ligand binds FAS death receptor (CD95) on the target cell, activating caspases (e.g., negative selection of thymocytes in thymus).

ii. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binds TNF receptor on the target cell, activating caspases.

3. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell-mediated pathway

i. Perforins secreted by CD8 + T cell create pores in membrane of target cell. ii. Granzyme from CD8 + T cell enters pores and activates caspases. iii. CD8 + T-cell killing of virally infected cells is an example.

FREE RADICAL INJURY

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Free radicals are chemical species with an unpaired electron in their outer orbit. B. Physiologic generation of free radicals occurs during oxidative phosphorylation.

1. Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) transfers electrons to oxygen. 2. Partial reduction of O2 yields superoxide (O2ꜙ), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 ), and

hydroxyl radicals (˙OH ).

C. Pathologic generation of free radicals arises with

1. Ionizing radiation - water hydrolyzed to hydroxyl free radical 2. Inflammation - NADPH oxidase generates superoxide ions during oxygen-

dependent killing by neutrophils.

3. Metals (e.g., copper and iron)-Fe 2+ generates hydroxyl free radicals (Fenton reaction).

4. Drugs and chemicals - P450 system of liver metabolizes drugs (e.g., acetaminophen), generating free radicals.

D. Free radicals cause cellular injury via peroxidation of lipids and oxidation of DNA and proteins; DNA damage is implicated in aging and oncogenesis.

E. Elimination of free radicals occurs via multiple mechanisms. 1. Antioxidants (e.g., glutathione and vitamins A , C, and E) 2. Enzymes

I) Superoxide dismutase (in mitochondria) - Superoxide (O2ꜙ) → H2O2 II) Glutathione peroxidase (in mitochondria) - 2GSH + free radical → GS-SG

and H O2
======================================
ꜙ and H2O

III) Catalase (in peroxisomes) - H2O2 → O2 3. Metal carrier proteins (e.g., transferrin and ceruloplasmin)

II. EXAMPLES OF FREE RADICAL INJURY

A. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)

1. Organic solvent used in the dry cleaning industry 2. Converted to CCl3 free radical by P450 system of hepatocytes 3. Results in cell injury with swelling of RER; consequently, ribosomes detach,

impairing protein synthesis.

4. Decreased apolipoproteins lead to fatty change in the liver (Fig. 1.12).

B. Reperfusion injury

1. Return of blood to ischemic tissue results in production of O2-derived free

radicals, which further damage tissue.

2. Leads to a continued rise in cardiac enzymes (e.g., troponin) after reperfusion of infarcted myocardial tissue

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

AMYLOIDOSIS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Amyloid is a misfolded protein that deposits in the extracellular space, thereby damaging tissues.

B. Multiple proteins can deposit as amyloid. Shared features include

1. β- pleated sheet configuration 2. Congo red staining and apple-green birefringence when viewed microscopically

under polarized light (Fig. 1.13)

C. Deposition can be systemic or localized.

II. SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS

A. Amyloid deposition in multiple organs; divided into primary and secondary amyloidosis

B. Primary amyloidosis is systemic deposition of AL amyloid, which is derived from

immunoglobulin light chain. 1. Associated with plasma cell dyscrasias (e.g., multiple myeloma)

C. Secondary amyloidosis is systemic deposition of AA amyloid, which is derived from

serum amyloid-associated protein (SAA). 1. SAA is an acute phase reactant that is increased in chronic inflammatory states,

malignancy, and Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).

2. FMF is due to a dysfunction of neutrophils (autosomal recessive) and occurs in

persons of Mediterranean origin. i. Presents with episodes of fever and acute serosal inflammation (can mimic

appendicitis, arthritis, or myocardial infarction)

ii. High SAA during attacks deposits as AA amyloid in tissues.

D. Clinical findings of systemic amyloidosis are diverse since almost any tissue can be

involved. Classic findings include 1. Nephrotic syndrome; kidney is the most common organ involved. 2. Restrictive cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia 3. Tongue enlargement, malabsorption, and hepatosplenomegaly

E. Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy. Abdominal fat pad and rectum are easily accessible biopsy targets.

F. Damaged organs must be transplanted. Amyloid cannot be removed.
======================================
III. LOCALIZED AMYLOIDOSIS

A. Amyloid deposition usually localized to a single organ. B. Senile cardiac amyloidosis

1. Non-mutated serum transthyretin deposits in the heart. 2. Usually asymptomatic; present in 25% of individuals > 80 years of age

C. Familial amyloid cardiomyopathy

Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death

1. Mutated serum transthyretin deposits in the heart leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy.

2. 5% of African Americans carry the mutated gene.

D. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type II)

1. Amylin (derived from insulin) deposits in the islets of the pancreas.

E. Alzheimer disease

1. Aβ amyloid (derived from β-amyloid precursor protein) deposits in the brain forming amyloid plaques.

2. Gene for β-APP is present on chromosome 21. Most individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alzheimer disease by the age of 40 (early-onset).

F. Dialysis-associated amyloidosis

1. β2-microglobulin deposits in joints.

G. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid

1. Calcitonin (produced by tumor cells) deposits within the tumor ('tumor cells in an amyloid background').

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

Immediate response involves release of preformed histamine granules, which mediate vasodilation of arterioles and increased vascular permeability. ii. Delayed response involves production of arachidonic acid metabolites,

particularly leukotrienes.

D. Complement

1. Proinflammatory serum proteins that "complement" inflammation 2. Circulate as inactive precursors; activation occurs via

i. Classical pathway - C1 binds IgG or IgM that is bound to antigen. ii. Alternative pathway - Microbial products directly activate complement. iii. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway - MBL binds to mannose on

microorganisms and activates complement.

3. All pathways result in production of C3 convertase (mediates C3 →C3a and

C3b), which, in turn, produces C5 convertase (mediates C5 → C5a and C5b). C5b complexes with C6-C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). i. C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins) - trigger mast cell degranulation, resulting in

histamine-mediated vasodilation and increased vascular permeability

ii. C5a - chemotactic for neutrophils iii. C3b - opsonin for phagocytosis iv. MAC - lyses microbes by creating a hole in the cell membrane

i. Coagulation and fibrinolytic systems ii. Complement iii. Kinin system - Kinin cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) to

bradykinin, which mediates vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (similar to histamine), as well as pain.

III. CARDINAL SIGNS OF INFLAMMATION A. Redness (rubor) and warmth (calor)

1. Due to vasodilation, which results in increased blood flow 2. Occurs via relaxation of arteriolar smooth muscle; key mediators are histamine,

prostaglandins, and bradykinin.

B. Swelling (tumor)

1. Due to leakage of fluid from postcapillary venules into the interstitial space
======================================
(exudate)

2. Key mediators are (1) histamine, which causes endothelial cell contraction and (2) tissue damage, resulting in endothelial cell disruption.

C. Pain (dolor)

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing

D. Fever

1. Pyrogens (e.g., LPS from bacteria) cause macrophages to release IL-1

and TNF, which increase cyclooxygenase activity in perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Increased PGE2 raises temperature set point.

2.

IV. NEUTROPHIL ARRIVAL AND FUNCTION

A. Step 1 - Margination

1. Vasodilation slows blood flow in postcapillary venules. 2. Cells marginate from center of flow to the periphery.

B. Step 2 - Rolling

1. Selectin "speed bumps" are upregulated on endothelial cells.

i. P-selectin release from Weibel-Palade bodies is mediated by histamine. ii. E-selectin is induced by TNF and IL-1. 2. Selectins bind sialyl Lewis X on leukocytes. 3.

C. Step 3 - Adhesion

1. Cellular adhesion molecules (ICAM and VCAM) are upregulated on

endothelium by TNF and IL-1. Integrins are upregulated on leukocytes by C5a and LTB4 Interaction between CAMs and integrins results in firm adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall.

2. 3.

4. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is most commonly due to an autosomal recessive

defect of integrins (CD18 subunit). i. Clinical features include delayed separation of the umbilical cord, increased circulating neutrophils (due to impaired adhesion of marginated pool of leukocytes), and recurrent bacterial infections that lack pus formation.

D. Step 4 - Transmigration and Chemotaxis

1. Leukocytes transmigrate across the endothelium of postcapillary venules and move toward chemical attractants (chemotaxis).

2. Neutrophils are attracted by bacterial products, IL-8, C5a, and LTB4.

E. Step 5 - Phagocytosis

1. Consumption of pathogens or necrotic tissue; phagocytosis is enhanced by opsonins (IgG and C3b).

2. Pseudopods extend from leukocytes to form phagosomes, which are internalized and merge with lysosomes to produce phagolysosomes.

3. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a protein trafficking defect (autosomal recessive) characterized by impaired phagolysosome formation. Clinical features include i. ii. Neutropenia (due to intramedullary death of neutrophils) iii. Giant granules in leukocytes (due to fusion of granules arising from the Golgi

apparatus)

iv. Defective primary hemostasis (due to abnormal dense granules in platelets) v. Albinism vi. Peripheral neuropathy
======================================
F. Step 6 - Destruction of phagocytosed material

1. O2-dependent killing is the most effective mechanism. 2. HOCl generated by oxidative burst in phagolysosomes destroys phagocytosed

2. HOCI generated by oxidative burst in phagolysosomes destroys phagocytosed microbes.

microbes. i. O2 is converted to O2ꜙ by NADPH oxidase (oxidative burst). ii. O2ꜙ is converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD). iii. H2O2 is converted to HOCl (bleach) by myeloperoxidase (MPO).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

3. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by poor O2-dependent

killing. i. Due to NADPH oxidase defect (X-linked or autosomal recessive) ii. Leads to recurrent infection and granuloma formation with catalase-positive

organisms, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia, Serratia marcescens, Nocardia, and Aspergillus

iii. Nitroblue tetrazolium test is used to screen for CGD. Leukocytes are incubated with NBT dye, which turns blue if NADPH oxidase can convert O2 to O2ꜙ, but remains colorless if NADPH oxidase is defective.

4. MPO deficiency results in defective conversion of H2O2 to HOCl.

Increased risk for Candida infections; however, most patients are asymptomatic.

ii. NBT is normal; respiratory burst (O2 to H2O2) is intact.

5. O2-independent killing is less effective than O2 -dependent killing and occurs via enzymes present in leukocyte secondary granules (e.g., lysozyme in macrophages and major basic protein in eosinophils).

G. Step 7 - Resolution

1. Neutrophils undergo apoptosis and disappear within 24 hours after resolution of the inflammatory stimulus.

V. MACROPHAGES

A. Macrophages predominate after neutrophils and peak 2-3 days after inflammation begins.

1. Derived from monocytes in blood

B. Arrive in tissue via the margination, rolling, adhesion, and transmigration sequence C. Ingest organisms via phagocytosis (augmented by opsonins) and destroy

phagocytosed material using enzymes (e.g., lysozyme) in secondary granules (O 2- independent killing)

D. Manage the next step of the inflammatory process. Outcomes include

1. Resolution and healing - Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and TGF- β) are produced by macrophages.

2. Continued acute inflammation - marked by persistent pus formation; IL-8 from macrophages recruits additional neutrophils.

3. Abscess - acute inflammation surrounded by fibrosis; macrophages mediate fibrosis via fibrogenic growth factors and cytokines.

4. Chronic inflammation - Macrophages present antigen to activate CD4+ helper T cells, which secrete cytokines that promote chronic inflammation.
======================================
CHRONIC INFLAMMATION

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Characterized by the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells in tissue (Fig. 2.lB) B. Delayed response, but more specific (adaptive immunity) than acute inflammation C.

AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Characterized by immune-mediated damage of self tissues

1. US prevalence is 1%-2%. B. Involves loss of self-tolerance

1. Self-reactive lymphocytes are regularly generated but develop central (thymus and bone marrow) or peripheral tolerance.

2. Central tolerance in thymus leads to T-cell (thymocyte) apoptosis or generation

of regulatory T cells. i. AIRE mutations result in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome.

3. Central tolerance in bone marrow leads to receptor editing or B-cell apoptosis. 4. Peripheral tolerance leads to anergy or apoptosis of T and B cells.

i. Fas apoptosis pathway mutations result in autoimmune lymphoproliferative

syndrome (ALPS).

5. Regulatory T cells suppress autoimmunity by blocking T-cell activation and

producing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β ). i. CD25 polymorphisms are associated with autoimmunity (MS and type

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

2. Association with certain HLA types (e.g., HLA-B27) and PTPN22 polymorphisms 3. Environmental triggers lead to bystander activation or molecular mimicry. E. Autoimmune disorders are clinically progressive with relapses and remissions and

often show overlapping features; partially explained by epitope spreading

II. SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS A. Chronic, systemic autoimmune disease 1. Flares and remissions are common.

B. Classically arises in middle-aged females, especially African American and Hispanic

women 1. May also arise in children and older adults (less dramatic gender bias)

C. Antigen-antibody complexes damage multiple tissues (type III HSR).

1. Poorly-cleared apoptotic debris (e.g., from UV damage) activates self-reactive lymphocytes, which then produce antibodies to host nuclear antigens.

2. Antigen-antibody complexes are generated at low levels and taken up by dendritic cells.

3. DNA antigens activate TLRs, amplifying immune response (IFN-α) . 4. Antigen-antibody complexes are subsequently generated at higher levels and

deposit in multiple tissues causing disease.

5. Deficiency of early complement proteins (C1q, C4, and C2) is associated with

SLE.

D. Almost any tissue can be involved. Classic findings include

1. Fever, weight loss, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and Raynaud phenomenon 2. Malar 'butterfly' rash (Fig. 2.4A) or discoid rash (Fig. 2.4B), especially upon

exposure to sunlight

3. Oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers (usually painless) 4. Arthritis (usually involving ≥ 2 joints) 5. Serositis (pleuritis and pericarditis) 6. Psychosis or seizures 7. Renal damage

i. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most common and most severe form of injury.

ii. Other patterns of injury (e.g., membranous glomerulonephritis) also occur.

8. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia (type II HSR) 9. Libman-Sacks endocarditis 10. Antinuclear antibody (ANA; sensitive, but not specific) 11. Anti-dsDNA or anti-Sm antibodies (highly specific)

E. Antiphospholipid antibody is associated with SLE (one-third of patients). 1. Autoantibody directed against proteins bound to phospholipids

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing

2. Important antiphospholipid antibodies include anticardiolipin (false-positive VDRL and RPR syphilis screening tests), anti-β2-glycoprotein I, and lupus anticoagulant (falsely-elevated PTT).

F. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by hypercoagulable state due

to antiphospholipid antibodies (especially lupus anticoagulant). 1. Results in arterial and venous thrombosis including deep venous, hepatic vein,

placental (recurrent pregnancy loss), and cerebral (stroke) thrombosis

2. Requires lifelong anticoagulation 3. Associated with SLE; however, more commonly occurs as a primary disorder

G. Antihistone antibody is characteristic of drug-induced lupus.

1. Procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid are common causes. 2. ANA is positive by definition. 3. CNS and renal involvement are rare. 4. Removal of drug usually results in remission.

H. First-line treatment includes avoiding exposure to direct sunlight and

glucocorticoids for flares; other immunosuppressive agents are useful in severe or refractory disease. 5-year survival is > 90%; renal failure, infection, and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis (occurs late) are common causes of death.

III. SJÖGREN SYNDROME

A. Autoimmune destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands 1. Lymphocyte-mediated damage (type IV HSR) with fibrosis

2. Pregnant women with anti-SSA are at risk for delivering babies with neonatal lupus and congenital heart block.

3. Anti-SSA and anti-SSB are also seen in a subset of patients with SLE (screen pregnant patients)

E. Lymphocytic sialadenitis on lip biopsy (minor salivary glands) is an additional diagnostic criterion (Fig. 2.4C).

F. Increased risk for B-cell (marginal zone) lymphoma, which presents as unilateral enlargement of the parotid gland late in disease course

IV. SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SCLERODERMA)

A. Autoimmune disorder characterized by sclerosis of skin and visceral organs 1. Classically presents in middle-aged females (30-50 years)

B. Fibroblast activation leads to deposition of collagen.

1. Autoimmune damage to mesenchyme is possible initiating event. 2. Endothelial dysfunction leads to inflammation (increased adhesion molecules), vasoconstriction (increased endothelin and decreased NO), and secretion of growth factors (TGF-β and PDGF).

3. Fibrosis, initially perivascular, progresses and causes organ damage.

WOUND HEALING

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Healing is initiated when inflammation begins. B. Occurs via a combination of regeneration and repair

II. REGENERATION

A. Replacement of damaged tissue with native tissue; dependent on regenerative capacity of tissue

capacity of tissue

B. Tissues are divided into three types based on regenerative capacity: labile, stable, and

permanent.

C. Labile tissues possess stem cells that continuously cycle to regenerate the tissue.

1. Small and large bowel (stem cells in mucosal crypts, Fig. 2.5) 2. Skin (stem cells in basal layer, Fig. 2.6) 3. Bone marrow (hematopoietic stem cells)

D. Stable tissues are comprised of cells that are quiescent (G 0) , but can reenter the cell

cycle to regenerate tissue when necessary. 1. Classic example is regeneration of liver by compensatory hyperplasia after partial

resection. Each hepatocyte produces additional cells and then reenters quiescence.

Fig. 2.4C Lymphocytic sialadenitis, Sjögren syndrome.

Fig. 2.4D Sclerodactyly, scleroderma.

Fig. 2.5 Intestinal crypts.

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing

E. Permanent tissues lack significant regenerative potential (e.g., myocardium, skeletal muscle, and neurons).

III. REPAIR

A. Replacement of damaged tissue with fibrous scar B. Occurs when regenerative stem cells are lost (e.g., deep skin cut) or when a tissue lacks regenerative capacity (e.g., healing after a myocardial infarction, Fig. 2.7)

C. Granulation tissue formation is the initial phase of repair (Fig. 2.8).

1. Consists of fibroblasts (deposit type III collagen), capillaries (provide nutrients), and myofibroblasts (contract wound)

D. Eventually results in scar formation, in which type III collagen is replaced with type

I collagen 1. Type III collagen is pliable and present in granulation tissue, embryonic tissue,

uterus, and keloids.

2. Type I collagen has high tensile strength and is present in skin, bone, tendons, and most organs.

3. Collagenase removes type III collagen and requires zinc as a cofactor.
======================================
IV. MECHANISMS OF TISSUE REGENERATION AND REPAIR

A. Mediated by paracrine signaling via growth factors (e.g., macrophages secrete growth factors that target fibroblasts)

B. Interaction of growth factors with receptors (e.g., epidermal growth factor with growth factor receptor) results in gene expression and cellular growth.

C. Examples of mediators include

1. TGF-α - epithelial and fibroblast g rowth factor 2. TGF-β - important fibroblast growth factor; also inhibits i nflammation 3. Platelet-derived growth factor - growth factor for endothelium, smooth muscle,

and fibroblasts

4. Fibroblast growth factor - important for angiogenesis; also mediates skeletal development

5. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) - important for angiogenesis

V. NORMAL AND ABERRANT WOUND HEALING

A. Cutaneous healing occurs via primary or secondary intention.

1. Primary intention-Wound edges are brought together (e.g., suturing of a surgical incision); leads to minimal scar formation

2. Secondary intention-Edges are not approximated. Granulation tissue fills the defect; myofibroblasts then contract the wound, forming a scar.

B. Delayed wound healing occurs in

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

2. Vitamin C, copper, or zinc deficiency

i. Vitamin C is an important cofactor in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine procollagen residues; hydroxylation is necessary for eventual collagen cross-linking.

ii. Copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase, which cross-links lysine and hydroxylysine to form stable collagen.

iii. Zinc is a cofactor for collagenase, which replaces the type III collagen of granulation tissue with stronger type I collagen.

3. Other causes include foreign body, ischemia, diabetes, and malnutrition. C. Dehiscence is rupture of a wound; most commonly seen after abdominal surgery D. Hypertrophic scar is excess production of scar tissue that is localized to the wound

(Fig. 2.9).

E. Keloid is excess production of scar tissue that is out of proportion to the wound (Fig.

2.10). 1. Characterized by excess type III collagen 2. Genetic predisposition (more common in African Americans) 3. Classically affects earlobes, face, and upper extremities

Principles of Neoplasia

NEOPLASIA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Neoplasia is new tissue growth that is unregulated, irreversible, and monoclonal; these features distinguish it from hyperplasia and repair.

B. Monoclonal means that the neoplastic cells are derived from a single mother cell. C. Clonality was historically determined by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase

Clonality was historically determined by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme isoforms.

(G6PD) enzyme isoforms. 1. Multiple isoforms (e.g., G6PDA, G6PDB

, and G6PDC) exist; only one isoform is inherited from each parent.

2. In females, one isoform is randomly inactivated in each cell by lyonization (G6PD is present on the X chromosome).

3. Normal ratio of active isoforms in cells of any tissue is 1:1 (e.g., 50% of cells have ).

G6PDA, and 50% of cells have G6PDB

4. 1:1 ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, which is polyclonal (cells are derived from multiple cells).

5. Only one isoform is present in neoplasia, which is monoclonal. 6. Clonality can also be determined by androgen receptor isoforms, which are also

present on the X chromosome.

D. Clonality of B lymphocytes is determined by immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain

phenotype. 1. Ig is comprised of heavy and light chains. 2. Each B cell expresses light chain that is either kappa or lambda. 3. Normal kappa to lambda light chain ratio is 3:1. 4. This ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, which is polyclonal. 5. Ratio increases to > 6:1 or is inverted (e.g., kappa to lambda ratio = 1:3) in

5 Ratio increases to > 6:1 or is inverted (e.g., kappa to lambda ratio = 1:3) in lymphoma, which is monoclonal.

lymphoma, which is monoclonal. E. Neoplastic tumors are benign or malignant.

1. Benign tumors remain localized and do not metastasize. 2. Malignant tumors (cancer) invade locally and have the potential to metastasize. F. Tumor nomenclature is based on lineage of differentiation (type of tissue produced)

and whether the tumor is benign or malignant (Table 3.1).

2. The leading causes of death in children are (1) accidents, (2) cancer, and (3) congenital defects.

B. The most common cancers by incidence in adults are (1) breast/prostate, (2) lung,

and (3) colorectal.

C. The most common causes of cancer mortality in adults are (1) lung, (2) breast/ prostate, and (3) colorectal.

III. ROLE OF SCREENING

A. Cancer begins as a single mutated cell. B. Approximately 30 divisions occur before the earliest clinical symptoms arise. C. Each division (doubling time) results in increased mutations.

1. Cancers that do not produce symptoms until late in disease will have undergone additional divisions and, hence, additional mutations.

2. Cancers that are detected late tend to have a poor prognosis. 3. Screening seeks to catch dysplasia (precancerous change) before it becomes

carcinoma or carcinoma before clinical symptoms arise; efficacy of screening, however, requires a decrease in cancer-specific mortality.

D. Common screening methods include

1. Pap smear - detects cervical dysplasia (CIN) before it becomes carcinoma 2. Mammography - detects in situ breast cancer (e.g., DCIS) before it invades or

invasive carcinoma before it becomes clinically palpable

3. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam - detects prostate carcinoma before it spreads

4. Hemoccult test (for occult blood in stool) and colonoscopy - detect colonic adenoma before it becomes colonic carcinoma or carcinoma before it spreads

CARCINOGENESIS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Cancer formation is initiated by damage to DNA of stem cells. The damage

overcomes DNA repair mechanisms, but is not lethal. 1. Carcinogens are agents that damage DNA, increasing the risk for cancer.

Important carcinogens include chemicals, oncogenic viruses, and radiation (Table 3.2).

B. DNA mutations eventually disrupt key regulatory systems, allowing for tumor

promotion (growth) and progression (spread). 1. Disrupted systems include proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and

regulators of apoptosis.
======================================
II. ONCOGENES

A. Proto-oncogenes are essential for cell growth and differentiation; mutations of proto-oncogenes form oncogenes that lead to unregulated cellular growth. B. Categories of oncogenes include growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal

B. Categories of oncogenes include growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transducers, nuclear regulators, and cell cycle regulators (Table 3.3).

transducers, nuclear regulators, and cell cycle regulators (Table 3.3). 1. Growth factors induce cellular growth (e.g., PDGFB in astrocytoma). 2. Growth factor receptors mediate signals from growth factors (e.g., ERBB2

2. Growth factor receptors mediate signals from growth factors (e.g., ERBB2 [HER2/neu] in breast cancer).

[HER2/neu] in breast cancer).

3. Signal transducers relay receptor activation to the nucleus (e.g., ras).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

i. Ras is associated with growth factor receptors in an inactive GDP-bound state.

ii. Receptor binding causes GDP to be replaced with GTP, activating ras. iii. Activated ras sends growth signals to the nucleus. iv. Ras inactivates itself by cleaving GTP to GDP; this is augmented by GTPase

activating protein.

v. Mutated ras inhibits the activity of GTPase activating protein. This prolongs the activated state of ras, resulting in increased growth signals.

4. Cell cycle regulators mediate progression through the cell cycle (e.g., cyclin and

cyclin-dependent kinase). i. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) form a complex which phosphorylates proteins that drive the cell through the cell cycle.

ii. For example, the cyclinD/CDK4 complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein, which promotes progression through the G 1/S checkpoint.

III. TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES

A. Regulate cell growth and, hence, decrease ("suppress") the risk of tumor formation; p53 and Rb (retinoblastoma) are classic examples.

B. p53 regulates progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase.

Table 3.3: Important Oncogenes and Associated Tumors

FUNCTION

MECHANISM

ASSOCIATED TUMOR
======================================
Principles of Neoplasia

1

2.

In response to DNA damage, p53 slows the cell cycle and upregulates DNA repair enzymes. If DNA repair is not possible, p53 induces apoptosis. i. p53 upregulates BAX, which disrupts Bcl2. ii. Cytochrome c leaks from the mitochondria activating apoptosis.

3. Both copies of the p53 gene must be knocked out for tumor formation (Knudson

two-hit hypothesis). i. ii. Germline mutation results in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (2nd hit is somatic),

characterized by the propensity to develop multiple types of carcinomas and sarcomas.

C. Rb also regulates progression from G1 to S phase.

1. Rb "holds" the E2F transcription factor, which is necessary for transition to the S phase.

2. E2F is released when RB is phosphorylated by the cyclinD/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) complex.

3. Rb mutation results in constitutively free E2F, allowing progression through the cell cycle and uncontrolled growth of cells.

4. Both copies of Rb gene must be knocked out for tumor formation (Knudson two-

hit hypothesis). i.

Sporadic mutation (both hits are somatic) is characterized by unilateral retinoblastoma (Fig. 3.1).

ii. Germline mutation results in familial retinoblastoma (2nd hit is somatic), characterized by bilateral retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma.

IV. REGULATORS OF APOPTOSIS

A. Prevent apoptosis in normal cells, but promote apoptosis in mutated cells whose DNA cannot be repaired (e.g., Bcl2)

1. Bcl2 normally stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane, blocking release of cytochrome c.

2. Disruption of Bcl2 allows cytochrome c to leave the mitochondria and activate apoptosis.

B. Bcl2 is overexpressed in follicular lymphoma.

1. t(14;18) moves Bcl2 (chromosome 18) to the Ig heavy chain locus (chromosome 14), resulting in increased Bcl2.

2. Mitochondrial membrane is further stabilized, prohibiting apoptosis. 3. B cells that would normally undergo apoptosis during somatic hypermutation in

the lymph node germinal center accumulate, leading to lymphoma.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY
======================================
V. OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES OF TUMOR DEVELOPMENT

A. Telomerase is necessary for cell immortality.

1. Normally, telomeres shorten with serial cell divisions, eventually resulting in cellular senescence.

2. Cancers often have upregulated telomerase, which preserves telomeres.

B. Angiogenesis (production of new blood vessels) is necessary for tumor survival and

growth. 1. FGF and VEGF (angiogenic factors) are commonly produced by tumor cells.

C. Avoiding immune surveillance is necessary for tumor survival.

1. Mutations often result in production of abnormal proteins, which are expressed on MHC class I.

2. CD8+ T cells detect and destroy such mutated cells. 3. Tumor cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating expression of

3. Tumor cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating expression of MHC class I

MHC class I. Immunodeficiency (both primary and secondary) increases risk for cancer.

4.

TUMOR PROGRESSION

I. TUMOR INVASION AND SPREAD

A. Accumulation of mutations eventually results in tumor invasion and spread.

1. Epithelial tumor cells are normally attached to one another by cellular adhesion molecules (e.g., E-cadherin).

2. Downregulation of E-cadherin leads to dissociation of attached cells. 3. Cells attach to laminin and destroy basement membrane (collagen type IV) via

collagenase.

4. Cells attach to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix and spread locally. 5. Entrance into vascular or lymphatic spaces allows for metastasis (distant spread).

II. ROUTES OF METASTASIS

A. Lymphatic spread is characteristic of carcinomas.

1. Initial spread is to regional draining lymph nodes (Fig. 3.2).

B. Hematogenous spread is characteristic of sarcomas and some carcinomas.

1. Renal cell carcinoma (often invades renal vein) 2. Hepatocellular carcinoma (often invades hepatic vein) 3. Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid 4. Choriocarcinoma

C. Seeding of body cavities is characteristic of ovarian carcinoma, which often involves the peritoneum ('omental caking', Fig. 3.3).

======================================
CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS

I. CLINICAL FEATURES

A. Benign tumors tend to be slow growing, well circumscribed, distinct, and mobile. B. Malignant tumors are usually rapid growing, poorly circumscribed, infiltrative, and

fixed to surrounding tissues and local structures.

C. Biopsy or excision is generally required before a tumor can be classified as benign or malignant with certainty.

1. Some benign tumors can grow in a malignant-like fashion, and some malignant tumors can grow in a benign-like fashion.

IL HISTOLOGIC FEATURES

A. Benign tumors are usually well differentiated (Fig. 3.4A). Characteristics include

1. Organized growth 2. Uniform nuclei 3. Low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio 4. Minimal mitotic activity 5. Lack of invasion (of basement membrane or local tissue) 6. No metastatic potential

B. Malignant tumors are classically poorly differentiated (anaplastic, Fig. 3.4B). Characteristics include

1. Disorganized growth (loss of polarity) 2. Nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia 3. High nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio 4. High mitotic activity with atypical mitosis 5. Invasion (through basement membrane or into local tissue)

C. Metastatic potential is the hallmark of malignancy-benign tumors never metastasize.

I

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

D. Immunohistochemistry is used to characterize tumors that are difficult to classify on histology (Fig. 3.5, Table 3.4).

III. SERUM TUMOR MARKERS

A. Proteins released by tumor into serum (e.g., PSA) B. Useful for screening, monitoring response to treatment, and monitoring recurrence C. Elevated levels require tissue biopsy for diagnosis of carcinoma (e.g., biopsy of

prostate with elevated PSA).

IV. GRADING OF CANCER

A. Microscopic assessment of differentiation (i.e., how much a cancer resembles the tissue in which it grows); takes into account architectural and nuclear features 1. Well differentiated (low grade)-resembles normal parent tissue 2. Poorly differentiated (high grade)-does not resemble parent tissue B. Important for determining prognosis; well-differentiated cancers have better

prognosis than poorly-differentiated cancers.

V. STAGING OF CANCER

A. Assessment of size and spread of a cancer B. Key prognostic factor; more important than grade C. Determined after final surgical resection of the tumor D. Utilizes TNM staging system

1. T - tumor (size and/or depth of invasion) 2. N - spread to regional lymph nodes; second most important prognostic factor 3. M - metastasis; single most important prognostic factor

Hemostasis and Related Disorders

INTRODUCTION

I. HEMOSTASIS

A. Integrity of the blood vessel is necessary to carry blood to tissues.

1. Damage to the wall is repaired by hemostasis, which involves formation of a thrombus (clot) at the site of vessel injury.

B. Hemostasis occurs in two stages: primary and secondary.

1. Primary hemostasis forms a weak platelet plug and is mediated by interaction between platelets and the vessel wall.

2. Secondary hemostasis stabilizes the platelet plug and is mediated by the coagulation cascade.

PRIMARY HEMOSTASIS AND RELATED BLEEDING DISORDERS

I. PRIMARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Step 1 - Transient vasoconstriction of damaged vessel

1. Mediated by reflex neural stimulation and endothelin release from endothelial cells

B. Step 2 - Platelet adhesion to the surface of disrupted vessel

1. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds exposed subendothelial collagen. 2. Platelets bind vWF using the GPIb receptor. . 3 vWF is derived from the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and

α- granules of platelets.

C. Step 3 - Platelet degranulation

1. Adhesion induces shape change in platelets and degranulation with release of

multiple mediators. i. ADP is released from platelet dense granules; promotes exposure of GPIIb/

IIIa receptor on platelets.

ii. TXA2 is synthesized by platelet cyclooxygenase (COX) and released; promotes platelet aggregation

D. Step 4 - Platelet aggregation

1. Platelets aggregate at the site of injury via GPIIb/IIIa using fibrinogen (from plasma) as a linking molecule; results in formation of platelet plug

2. Platelet plug is weak; coagulation cascade (secondary hemostasis) stabilizes it.
======================================
II. DISORDERS OF PRIMARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Usually due to abnormalities in platelets; divided into quantitative or qualitative disorders

B. Clinical features include mucosal and skin bleeding.

1. Symptoms of mucosal bleeding include epistaxis (most common overall symptom), hemoptysis, GI bleeding, hematuria, and menorrhagia. Intracranial bleeding occurs with severe thrombocytopenia.

2. Symptoms of skin bleeding include petechiae (1-2 mm, Fig. 4.1), purpura (> 3 mm), ecchymoses (> 1 cm), and easy bruising; petechiae are a sign of thrombocytopenia and are not usually seen with qualitative disorders.

31

32

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

C. Useful laboratory studies include

1. Platelet count - normal 150-400 K/µL; < 50 K/µL leads to symptoms. 2. Bleeding time - normal 2-7 minutes; prolonged with quantitative and qualitative

platelet disorders

3. Blood smear - used to assess number and size of platelets 4. Bone marrow biopsy - used to assess megakaryocytes, which produce platelets

III. IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (ITP)

A. Autoimmune production of IgG against platelet antigens (e.g., GPIIb/IIIa) 1. Most common cause of thrombocytopenia in children and adults

B. Autoantibodies are produced by plasma cells in the spleen. C. Antibody-bound platelets are consumed by splenic macrophages, resulting in

thrombocytopenia.

D. Divided into acute and chronic forms

1. Acute form arises in children weeks after a viral infection or immunization; self-limited, usually resolving within weeks of presentation

2. Chronic form arises in adults, usually women of childbearing age. May be primary or secondary (e.g., SLE). May cause short-lived thrombocytopenia in offspring since antiplatelet IgG can cross the placenta.

E. Laboratory findings include

1. ↑ platelet count, often < 50 K/µL 2. Normal PT/PTT - Coagulation factors are not affected. 3. ↓ megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy

F. Initial treatment is corticosteroids. Children respond well; adults may show early
======================================
response, but often relapse. 1.

IVIG is used to raise the platelet count in symptomatic bleeding, but its effect is short-li ved.

2. Splenectomy eliminates the primary source of antibody and the site of platelet destruction (performed in refractory cases).

IV. MICROANGIOPATHIC HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

A. Pathologic formation of platelet microthrombi in small vessels 1. Platelets are consumed in the formation of microthrombi. 2. RBCs are "sheared" as they cross microthrombi, resulting in hemolytic anemia

with schistocytes (Fig. 4.2).

B. Seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic

syndrome (HUS)

C. TTP is due to decreased ADAMTS13, an enzyme that normally cleaves vWF multimers into smaller monomers for eventual degradation.

Fig.4.1 Petechiae involving skin.

Fig. 4.2 Schistocyte.

Hemostasis and Related Disorders

Hemostasis and Related Disorders

1. Large, uncleaved multimers lead to abnormal platelet adhesion, resulting in microthrombi.

2. Decreased ADAMTS13 is usually due to an acquired autoantibody; most commonly seen in adult females

D. HUS is due to endothelial damage by drugs or infection.

1. Classically seen in children with E coli O157:H7 dysentery, which results from exposure to undercooked beef

2. E coli verotoxin damages endothelial cells resulting in platelet microthrombi.

E. Clinical findings (HUS and TTP) include

1. Skin and mucosal bleeding 2. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 3. Fever 4. Renal insufficiency (more common in HUS) - Thrombi involve vessels of the

kidney.

5. CNS abnormalities (more common in TTP) - Thrombi involve vessels of the CNS.

F. Laboratory findings include

1. Thrombocytopenia with ↑ bleeding time 2. Normal PT/PTT (coagulation cascade is not activated) 3. Anemia with schistocytes 4. ↑megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy

G. Treatment involves plasmapheresis and corticosteroids, particularly in TTP.

V. QUALITATIVE PLATELET DISORDERS

A. Bernard-Soulier syndrome is due to a genetic GPIb deficiency; platelet adhesion is

impaired. 1. Blood smear shows mild thrombocytopenia with enlarged platelets. B. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is due to a genetic GPIIb/IIIa deficiency; platelet

aggregation is impaired.

C. Aspirin irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase; lack of TXA2impairs aggregation. D. Uremia disrupts platelet function; both adhesion and aggregation are impaired.
======================================
SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS AND RELATED DISORDERS

I.

SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS A. Stabilizes the weak platelet plug via the coagulation cascade

1. Coagulation cascade generates thrombin, which converts fibrinogen in the platelet plug to fibrin.

2. Fibrin is then cross-linked, yielding a stable platelet-fibrin thrombus.

B. Factors of the coagulation cascade are produced by the liver in an inactive state.

Activation requires 1. Exposure to an activating substance

i. Tissue thromboplastin activates factor VII (extrinsic pathway). ii. Subendothelial collagen activates factor XII (intrinsic pathway).

2. Phospholipid surface of platelets 3. Calcium (derived from platelet dense granules)

II. DISORDERS OF SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Usually due to factor abnormalities B. Clinical features include deep tissue bleeding into muscles and joints (hemarthrosis)

and rebleeding after surgical procedures (e.g., circumcision and wisdom tooth extraction).

C. Laboratory studies include

33

34

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Prothrombin time (PT)-measures extrinsic (factor VII) and common (factors II, V, X, and fibrinogen) pathways of the coagulation cascade

2. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)-measures intrinsic (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII) and common (factors II, V, X, and fibrinogen) pathways of the coagulation cascade

III. HEMOPHILIA A

A. Genetic factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency

1. X-linked recessive (predominantly affects males) 2. Can arise from a new mutation (de novo) without any family history

B. Presents with deep tissue, joint, and postsurgical bleeding 1. Clinical severity depends on the degree of deficiency.

C. Laboratory findings include 1. ↑PTT; normal PT 2. ↓ FVIII 3. Normal platelet count and bleeding time

D. Treatment involves recombinant FVIII.

IV. HEMOPHILIA B (CHRISTMAS DISEASE)

A. Genetic factor IX deficiency

1. Resembles hemophilia A, except FIX levels are decreased instead of FVIII

V. COAGULATION FACTOR INHIBITOR

A. Acquired antibody against a coagulation factor resulting in impaired factor function;

anti-FVIII is most common. 1. Clinical and lab findings are similar to hemophilia A. 2. PTT does not correct upon mixing normal plasma with patient's plasma (mixing

study) due to inhibitor; PTT does correct in hemophilia A.

VI. VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE A. Genetic vWF deficiency

1. Most common inherited coagulation disorder

B. Multiple subtypes exist, causing quantitative and qualitative defects; the most common type is autosomal dominant with decreased vWF levels.

C. Presents with mild mucosal and skin bleeding; low vWF impairs platelet adhesion. D. Laboratory findings include

1. ↑bleeding time 2. ↑PTT; normal PT - Decreased FVIII half-life (vWF normally stabilizes FVIII); however, deep tissue, joint, and postsurgical bleeding are usually not seen. 3. Abnormal ristocetin test - Ristocetin induces platelet agglutination by causing vWF tobind platelet GPIb; lack of vWF → impaired agglutination →abnormal test.

E. Treatment is desmopressin (ADH analog), which increases vWF release from Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells.
======================================
VII. VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY

A. Disrupts function of multiple coagulation factors

1. Vitamin K is activated by epoxide reductase in the liver. 2. Activated vitamin K gamma carboxylates factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C

and S; gamma carboxylation is necessary for factor function.

B. Deficiency occurs in :

Hemostasis and Related Disorders

1. Newborns - due to lack of GI colonization by bacteria that normally synthesize vitamin K; vitamin K injection is given prophylactically to all newborns at birth to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.

2. Long-term antibiotic therapy - disrupts vitamin K-producing bacteria in the GI tract

3. Malabsorption - leads to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K

VIII. OTHER CAUSES OF ABNORMAL SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Liver failure - decreased production of coagulation factors and decreas ed activation of vitamin K by epoxide reductase; effect of liver failure on coagulation is followed using PT

B. Large-volume transfusion - dilutes coagulation factors, resulting in a relati ve deficiency

OTHER DISORDERS OF HEMOSTASIS

I. HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA

A. Platelet destruction that arises secondary to heparin therapy B. Fragments of destroyed platelets may activate remaining platelets, leading to

thrombosis.

IL DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION

A. Pathologic activation of the coagulation cascade

1. Widespread microthrombi result in ischemia and infarction. 2. Consumption of platelets and factors results in bleeding, especially from IV sites

and mucosal surfaces (bleeding from body orifices).

B. Almost always secondary to another disease process

1. Obstetric complications - Tissue thromboplastin in the amniotic fluid activates coagulation.

2. Sepsis (especially with E coli or N meningitidis) - Endotoxins from the bacterial wall and cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL-1) induce endothelial cells to make tissue factor.

3. Adenocarcinoma - Mucin activates coagulation. 4. Acute promyelocytic leukemia - Primary granules activate coagulation. 5. Rattlesnake bite - Venom activates coagulation.

C. Laboratory findings include

1. ↓ platelet count 2. ↑PT/PTT 3. ↓ fibrinogen 4. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 5. Elevated fibrin split products, particularly D-dimer

i. Elevated D-dimer is the best screening test for DIC. ii. Derived from splitting of cross-linked fibrin; D-dimer is not produced from

splitting of fibrinogen.

D. Treatment involves addressing the underlying cause and transfusing blood products and cryoprecipitate (contains coagulation factors), as necessary.
======================================
III. DISORDERS OF FIBRINOLYSIS

A. Normal fibrinolysis removes thrombus after damaged vessel heals.

1. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) converts plasminogen to plasmin. 2. Plasmin cleaves fibrin and serum fibrinogen, destroys coagulation factors, and

blocks platelet aggregation.

3. α2-antiplasmin inactivates plasmin.

35

36

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

B. Disorders of fibrinolysis are due to plasmin overactivity resulting in excessive cleavage

of serum fibrinogen. Examples include 1. Radical prostatectomy - Release of urokinase activates plasmin. 2. Cirrhosis of liver - reduced production of α 2 -antiplasmin

C. Presents with increased bleeding (resembles DIC) D. Laboratory findings include

1. ↑PT/PTT - Plasmin destroys coagulation factors. 2. ↑bleeding time with normal platelet count - Plasmin blocks platelet aggregation. 3. Increased fibrinogen split products without D-dimers - Serum fibrinogen is lysed; however, D-dimers are not formed because fibrin thrombi are absent.

E. Treatment is aminocaproic acid, which blocks activation of plasminogen.

THROMBOSIS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Pathologic formation of an intravascular blood clot (thrombus)

1. Can occur in an artery or vein 2. Most common location is the deep veins (DVT) of the leg below the knee. B. Characterized by (1) lines of Zahn (alternating layers of platelets/fibrin and RBCs,

Fig. 4.3) and (2) attachment to vessel wall

1. Both features distinguish thrombus from postmortem clot.

C. Three major risk factors for thrombosis are disruption in blood flow, endothelial cell damage, and hypercoagulable state (Virchow triad).

II. DISRUPTION IN NORMAL BLOOD FLOW

A. Stasis and turbulence of blood flow increases risk for thrombosis.

1. Blood flow is normally continuous and laminar; keeps platelets and factors dispersed and inactivated

B. Examples include

1. Immobilization - increased risk for deep venous thrombosis 2. Cardiac wall dysfunction (e.g., arrhythmia or myocardial infarction) 3. Aneurysm

III. ENDOTHELIAL CELL DAMAGE

A. Endothelial damage disrupts the protective function of endothelial cells, increasing the risk for thrombosis.

B. Endothelial cells prevent thrombosis by several mechanisms.

1. Block exposure to subendothelial collagen and underlying tissue factor 2. Produce prostacyclin (PGI2) and NO - vasodilation and inhibition of platelet

aggregation

Fig. 4.3 Lines of Zahn characterized by alternating layers of platelets/fibrin and RBCs.

Hemostasis and Related Disorders

3. Secrete heparin-like molecules - augment antithrombin III (ATIII), which inactivates thrombin and coagulation factors

4. Secrete tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) - converts plasminogen to plasmin, which (1) cleaves fibrin and serum fibrinogen, (2) destroys coagulation factors, and (3) blocks platelet aggregation

5. Secrete thrombomodulin - redirects thrombin to activate protein C, which inactivates factors V and VIII

C. Causes of endothelial cell damage include atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and high levels of homocysteine.

1. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency result in mildly elevated homocysteine levels,

increasing the risk for thrombosis. i. Folic acid (tetrahydrofolate, THF) circulates as methyl-THF in the serum. ii. Methyl is transferred to cobalamin (vitamin B12), allowing THF to participate

in the synthesis of DNA precursors.

iii. Cobalamin transfers methyl to homocysteine resulting in methionine. iv. Lack of vitamin B12 or folate leads to decreased conversion of homocysteine to

methionine resulting in buildup of homocysteine.

2. Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency results in high homocysteine levels

with homocystinuria. i. CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine; enzyme deficiency leads to

homocysteine buildup.

ii. Characterized by vessel thrombosis, mental retardation, lens dislocation, and long slender fingers.
======================================
IV. HYPERCOAGULABLE STATE

A. Due to excessive procoagulant proteins or defective anticoagulant proteins; may be inherited or acquired

B. Classic presentation is recurrent DVTs or DVT at a young age.

1. Usually occurs in the deep veins of the leg; other sites include hepatic and cerebral veins.

C. Protein C or S deficiency (autosomal dominant) decreases negative feedback on the coagulation cascade.

1 Proteins C and Snormally inactivate factors V and VIII.

1. Proteins C and S normally inactivate factors V and VIII. 2. Increased risk for warfarin skin necrosis

i

ii

Initial stage of warfarin therapy results in a temporary deficiency of proteins C and S (due to shorter half-life) relative to factors II, VII, IX, and X In preexisting C or S deficiency, a severe deficiency is seen at the onset of warfarin therapy increasing risk for thrombosis, especially in the skin.

D. Factor V Leiden is a mutated form of factor V that lacks the cleavage site for deactivation by proteins C and S.

1. Most common inherited cause of hypercoagulable state

E. Prothrombin 20210A is an inherited point mutation in prothrombin that results in increased gene expression.

1. Increased prothrombin results in increased thrombin, promoting thrombus formation.

F. ATIII deficiency decreases the protective effect of heparin-like molecules produced by the endothelium, increasing the risk for thrombus.

1. Heparin-like molecules normally activate ATIII, which inactivates thrombin and coagulation factors.

2. In ATIII deficiency, PTT does not rise with standard heparin dosing. i. Pharmacologic heparin works by binding and activating ATIII. ii. High doses of heparin activate limited ATIII; coumadin is then given to

maintain an anticoagulated state.

37

38

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

G. Oral contraceptives are associated with a hypercoagulable state.

1. Estrogen induces increased production of coagulation factors, thereby increasing the risk for thrombosis.

EMBOLISM

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

Intravascular mass that travels and occludes downstream vessels; symptoms depend on the vessel involved.

B. Thromboembolus is due to a thrombus that dislodges; most common type of embolus

(>95%)

C. Atherosclerotic embolus is due to an atherosclerotic plaque that dislodges.

1. Characterized by the presence of cholesterol clefts in the embolus (Fig. 4.4A) D. Fat embolus is associated with bone fractures, particularly long bones, and soft tissue

D. Fat embolus is associated with bone fractures, particularly long bones, and soft tissue trauma.

trauma. 1. Develops while fracture is still present or shortly after repair 2. Characterized by dyspnea (fat, often with bone marrow elements, is seen in pulmonary

vessels, Fig. 4.4B) and petechiae on the skin overlying the chest

E. Gas embolus is classically seen in decompression sickness.

1. Nitrogen gas precipitates out of blood due to rapid ascent by a diver. 2. Presents with joint and muscle pain ('bends') and respiratory symptoms

('chokes').

3. Chronic form (Caisson disease) is characterized by multifocal ischemic necrosis of bone.

4. Gas embolus may also occur during laparoscopic surgery (air is pumped into the abdomen).

F. Amniotic fluid embolus enters maternal circulation during labor or delivery

1. Presents with shortness of breath, neurologic symptoms, and DIC (due to the thrombogenic nature of amniotic fluid)

2. Characterized by squamous cells and keratin debris, from fetal skin, in embolus (Fig. 4.4C)
======================================
II. PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE)

A. Usually due to thromboembolus; the most common source is deep venous thrombus (DVT) of the lower extremity, usually involving the femoral, iliac, or popliteal veins. B. Most often clinically silent because (1) the lung has a dual blood supply (via pulmonary

and bronchial arteries) and (2) the embolus is usually small (self-resolves)

Red Blood Cell Disorders

ANEMIA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Reduction in circulating red blood cell (RBC) mass B. Presents with signs and symptoms of hypoxia

1. Weakness, fatigue, and dyspnea 2. Pale conjunctiva and skin 3. Headache and light headedness 4. Angina, especially with preexisting coronary artery disease

C. Hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and RBC count are used as surrogates for RBC

mass, which is difficult to measure. 1. Anemia is defined as Hb < 13.5 g/dL in males and< 12.5 g/dL in females (normal

Hb is 13.5-17.5 g/dL in males and 12.5-16.0 g/dL in females).

D. Based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV), anemia can be classified as microcytic (MCV < 80 µm3), normocytic (MCV = 80-100 µm3), or macrocytic (MCV > 100 µm3).

MICROCYTIC ANEMIAS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anemia with MCV < 80 µm 3 B. Microcytic anemias are due to decreased production of hemoglobin.

1. RBC progenitor cells in the bone marrow are large and normally divide multiple times to produce smaller mature cells (MCV = 80-100 µm3).

2. Microcytosis is due to an "extra" division which occurs to maintain hemoglobin concentration.

C. Hemoglobin is made of heme and glob in; heme is composed of iron and protoporphyrin. A decrease in any of these components leads to microcytic anemia.

D. Microcytic anemias include (1) iron deficiency anemia, (2) anemia of chronic disease, (3) sideroblastic anemia, and (4) thalassemia.

IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA A. Due to decreased levels of iron

1. ↓i ron →↓heme → ↓hemoglobin → m icrocytic anemia

B. Most common type of anemia

1. Lack of iron is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, affecting roughly 1/3 of world's population.

C. Iron is consumed in heme (meat-derived) and non-heme (vegetable-derived) forms. 1. Absorption occurs in the duodenum. Enterocytes have heme and non-heme

(DMT1) transporters; the heme form is more readily absorbed.

2. Enterocytes transport iron across the cell membrane into blood via ferroportin. 3. Transferrin transports iron in the blood and delivers it to liver and bone marrow

macrophages for storage.

4. Stored intracellular iron is bound to ferritin, which prevents iron from forming free radicals via the Fenton reaction.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

α-Thalassemia is usually due to gene deletion; normally, 4 alpha genes are present on chromosome 16

D.

a One gene deleted - asymptomatic

One gene deleted - asymptomatic Two genes deleted - mild anemia with ↑ RBC count; cis deletion is associated

1. with an increased risk of severe thalassemia in offspring. 2.

i. Cis deletion is when both deletions occur on the same chromosome; seen in Asians

ii. Trans deletion is when one deletion occurs on each chromosome; seen in Africans, including African Americans

3.

Three genes deleted-severe anemia; b damage RBCs; HbH is seen on electrophoresis. Four genes deleted-lethal in utero (hydrops fetalis); g chains form tetramers (Hb Barts) that damage RBCs; Hb Barts is seen on electrophoresis.

E.

4. b -Thalassemia is usually due to gene mutations (point mutations in promoter or splicing sites); seen in individuals of African and Mediterranean descent 1. Two β genes are present on chromosome 11; mutations result in absent (β0) or

diminished (β+) production of the β-globin chain.

2. β-Thalassemia minor (β/β+) is the mildest form of disease and is usually

asymptomatic with an increased RBC count. i. Microcytic, hypochromic RBCs and target cells are seen on blood smear (Fig.

5.3).

ii. Hemoglobin electrophoresis shows slightly decreased HbA with increased HbA (5%, normal 25%) and HbF (2%, normal 1%). .

2

3. β-Thalassemia major (β0/β0) is the most severe form of disease and presents with severe anemia a few months after birth; high HbF (α2γ 2) at birth is temporarily protective. i. Unpaired α chains precipitate and damage RBC membrane, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and extravascular hemolysis (removal of circulating RBCs by the spleen).

ii. Massive erythroid hyperplasia ensues resulting in (1) expansion of hematopoiesis into the skull (reactive bone formation leads to 'crewcut' appearance on x-ray, Fig. 5.4) and facial bones ('chipmunk fades'), (2) extramedullary hematopoiesis with hepatosplenomegaly, and (3) risk of aplastic crisis with parvovirus B19 infection of erythroid precursors. iii. Chronic transfusions are often necessary; leads to risk for secondary

hemochromatosis

iv. Smear shows microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with target cells and nucleated

red blood cells. Electrophoresis shows HbA2 and HbF with little or no HbA.

Red Blood Cell Disorders

MACROCYTIC ANEMIA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anemia with MCV > 100 µm3 ; most commonly due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency (megaloblastic anemia)

B. Folate and vitamin B12 are necessary for synthesis of DNA precursors.

1. Folate circulates in the serum as methyltetrahydrofolate (methyl THF); removal of the methyl group allows for participation in the synthesis of DNA precursors.

2. Methyl group is transferred to vitamin B12 (cobalamin). 3. Vitamin B12 then transfers it to homocysteine, producing methionine.

C. Lack of folate or vitamin B12 impairs synthesis of DNA precursors.

1. Impaired division and enlargement of RBC precursors leads to megaloblastic anemia.

2. Impaired division of granulocytic precursors leads to hypersegmented neutrophils.

3. Megaloblastic change is also seen in rapidly-dividing (e.g., intestinal) epithelial cells.

D. Other causes of macrocytic anemia (without megaloblastic change) include alcoholism, liver disease, and drugs (e.g., 5-FU).

II. FOLATE DEFICIENCY

A. Dietary folate is obtained from green vegetables and some fruits. 1. Absorbed in the jejunum

B. Folate deficiency develops within months, as body stores are minimal. C. Causes include poor diet (e.g., alcoholics and elderly), increased demand (e.g.,

C. Causes include poor diet (e.g., alcoholics and elderly), increased demand (eg., pregnancy, cancer, and hemolytic anemia), and folate antagonists (e.g, methotrexate, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase).

pregnancy, cancer, and hemolytic anemia), and folate antagonists (e.g., methotrexate, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase). D. Clinical and laboratory findings include

1. Macrocytic RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils (> 5 lobes, Fig. 5.5) 2. Glossitis 3. ↓ serum folate 4. ↑ serum homocysteine (increases risk for thrombosis) 5. Normal methylmalonic acid
======================================
III. VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY

A. Dietary vitamin B12 is complexed to animal-derived proteins.

1. Salivary gland enzymes (e.g., amylase) liberate vitamin B12, which is then bound by R-binder (also from the salivary gland) and carried through the stomach.

2. Pancreatic proteases in the duodenum detach vitamin Bl2 from R-binder. 3. Vitamin Bl2 binds intrinsic factor (made by gastric parietal cells) in the small

bowel; the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex is absorbed in the ileum.

B. Vitamin B12 deficiency is less common than folate deficiency and takes years to develop due to large hepatic stores of vitamin B12.

C. Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency.

1. Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells (body of stomach) leads to intrinsic factor deficiency

D. Other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include pancreatic insufficiency and damage to the terminal ileum (e.g., Crohn disease or Diphyllobothrium latum [fish tapeworm]); dietary deficiency is rare, except in vegans.

E. Clinical and laboratory findings include

1. Macrocytic RBCs with hypersegmented neutrophils 2. Glossitis 3. Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord

45

46

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

i. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for the conversion of methylmalonic acid to succinyl CoA (important in fatty acid metabolism).

ii. Vitamin B12 deficiency results in increased levels of methylmalonic acid, which impairs spinal cord myelinization.

iii. Damage results in poor proprioception and vibratory sensation (posterior column) and spastic paresis (lateral corticospinal tract).

4. ↓ serum vitamin B12 5. ↑ serum homocysteine (similar to folate deficiency), which increases risk for

thrombosis

6. ↑ methylmalonic acid (unlike folate deficiency)

NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anemia with normal-sized RBCs (MCV = 80-100 µm3) B. Due to increased peripheral destruction or underproduction

1. Reticulocyte count helps to distinguish between these two etiologies.

II. RETICULOCYTES

A. Young RBCs released from the bone marrow

1. Identified on blood smear as larger cells with bluish cytoplasm (due to residual RNA, Fig. 5.6)

B. Normal reticulocyte count (RC) is 1-2%.

1. RBC lifespan is 120 days; each day roughly 1-2% of RBCs are removed from circulation and replaced by reticulocytes.

C. A properly functioning marrow responds to anemia by increasing the RC to > 3%. D. RC, however, is falsely elevated in anemia.

1. RC is measured as percentage of total RBCs; decrease in total RBCs falsely elevates percentage of reticulocytes.

E. RC is corrected by multiplying reticulocyte count by Hct/45.

1. Corrected count > 3% indicates good marrow response and suggests peripheral destruction.

2. Corrected count < 3% indicates poor marrow response and suggests underproduction.
======================================
III. PERIPHERAL RBC DESTRUCTION (HEMOLYSIS)

A. Divided into extravascular and intravascular hemolysis; both result in anemia with a good marrow response.

B. Extravascular hemolysis involves RBC destruction by the reticuloendothelial system (macrophages of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes).

Red Blood Cell Disorders

1. Macrophages consume RBCs and break down hemoglobin.

i. Globin is broken down into amino acids. ii. Heme is broken down into iron and protoporphyrin; iron is recycled. iii. Protoporphyrin is broken down into unconjugated bilirubin, which is bound to serum albumin and delivered to the liver for conjugation and excretion into bile.

2. Clinical and laboratory findings include

i. Anemia with splenomegaly, jaundice due to unconjugated bilirubin, and increased risk for bilirubin gallstones

ii. Marrow hyperplasia with corrected reticulocyte count > 3% C. Intravascular hemolysis involves destruction of RBCs within vessels.

1. Clinical and laboratory findings include

i. Hemoglobinemia ii. Hemoglobinuria iii. Hemosiderinuria - Renal tubular cells pick up some of the hemoglobin that is filtered into the urine and break it down into iron, which accumulates as hemosiderin; tubular cells are eventually shed resulting in hemosiderinuria.

iv. Decreased serum haptoglobin

NORMOCYTIC ANEMIAS WITH PREDOMINANT EXTRAVASCULAR HEMOLYSIS

I. HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS

A. Inherited defect of RBC cytoskeleton-membrane tethering proteins

1. Most commonly involves ankyrin, spectrin, or band 3

B. Membrane blebs are formed and lost over time.

1. Loss of membrane renders cells round (spherocytes) instead of disc-shaped. 2. Spherocytes are less able to maneuver through splenic sinusoids and are

consumed by splenic macrophages, resulting in anemia.

C. Clinical and laboratory findings include

1. Spherocytes with loss of central pallor (Fig. 5.7) 2. ↑ RDW and ↑ mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 3. Splenomegaly, jaundice with unconjugated bilirubin, and increased risk for

bilirubin gallstones (extravascular hemolysis)

4. Increased risk for aplastic crisis with parvovirus B19 infection of erythroid precursors

D. Diagnosed by osmotic fragility test, which reveals increased spherocyte fragility in hypotonic solution

E. Treatment is splenectomy; anemia resolves, but spherocytes persist and Howell-Jolly bodies (fragments of nuclear material in RBCs) emerge on blood smear (Fig. 5.8).
======================================
II. SICKLE CELL ANEMIA

A. Autosomal recessive mutation in β chain of hemoglobin; a single amino acid change replaces normal glutamic acid (hydrophilic) with valine (hydrophobic).

B. Gene is carried by 10% of individuals of African descent, likely due to protective role against falciparum malaria.

C. Sickle cell disease arises when two abnormal β genes are present; results in >90% HbS in RBCs

D. HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated; polymers aggregate into needle-like

structures, resulting in sickle cells (Fig. 5.9). Increased risk of sickling occurs with hypoxemia, dehydration, and acidosis. l. 2. HbF protects against sickling; high HbF at birth is protective for the first few

months of life. Treatment with hydroxyurea increases levels of HbF.

47

48

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

E. Cells continuously sickle and de-sickle while passing through the microcirculation,

resulting in complications related to RBC membrane damage. 1. Extravascular hemolysis - Reticuloendothelial system removes RBCs with damaged membranes, leading to anemia, jaundice with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and increased risk for bilirubin gallstones. Intravascular hemolysis - RBCs with damaged membranes dehydrate, leading to hemolysis with decreased haptoglobin and target cells on blood smear.

3. Massive erythroid hyperplasia ensues resulting in

i. Expansion of hematopoiesis into the skull ('crewcut' appearance on x-ray) and facial bones ('chipmunk fades')

ii. Extramedullary hematopoiesis with hepatomegaly iii. Risk of aplastic crisis with parvovirus B19 infection of erythroid precursors

F. Extensive sickling leads to complications of vaso-occlusion.

1. Dactylitis - swollen hands and feet due to vaso-occlusive infarcts in bones; common presenting sign in infants

2. Autosplenectomy - shrunken, fibrotic spleen. Consequences include

i

Increased risk of infection with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (most common cause of death in children); affected children should be vaccinated by 5 years of age. Increased risk of Salmonella paratyphi osteomyelitis
======================================
ii. iii. Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smear

3. Acute chest syndrome - vaso-occlusion in pulmonary microcirculation i. Presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and lung infiltrates ii. Often precipitated by pneumonia iii. Most common cause of death in adult patients

4. Pain crisis 5. Renal papillary necrosis - results in gross hematuria and proteinuria

G. Sickle cell trait is the presence of one mutated and one normal chain; results in<

50% HbS in RBCs (HbA is slightly more efficiently produced than HbS) 1. Generally asymptomatic with no anemia; RBCs with < 50% HbS do not sickle in

1, Generally asymptomatic with no anemia; RBCs with < 50% HbS do not sickle in vivo except in the renal medulla.

vivo except in the renal medulla. i. Extreme hypoxia and hypertonicity of the medulla cause sickling, which

results in microinfarctions leading to microscopic hematuria and, eventually, decreased ability to concentrate urine.

H. Laboratory findings

1. Sickle cells and target cells are seen on blood smear in sickle cell disease, but not in sickle cell trait. 2. Metabisulfite screen causes cells with any amount of HbS to sickle; positive in both disease and trait 3. Hb electrophoresis confirms the presence and amount of HbS .

1. Normal glutamic acid is replaced by lysine. 2. Less common than sickle cell disease

NORMOCYTIC ANEMIAS WITH PREDOMINANT INTRAVASCULAR HEMOLYSIS

Acquired defect in myeloid stem cells resulting in absent glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI); renders cells susceptible to destruction by complement

glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI); renders cells susceptible to destruction by complement 1. Blood cells coexist with complement. 2. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) on the surface of blood cells protects against

complement-mediated damage by inhibiting C3 convertase.

3. DAF is secured to the cell membrane by GPI (an anchoring glycolipid). 4. Absence of GPI leads to absence of DAF, rendering cells susceptible to

complement-mediated damage.

B. Intravascular hemolysis occurs episodically, often at night during sleep.

1. Mild respiratory acidosis develops with shallow breathing during sleep and activates complement.

2. RBCs, WBCs, and platelets are lysed. 3. Intravascular hemolysis leads to hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria

3 Intravascular hemolysis leads to hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria (especially in the morning); hemosiderinuria is seen days after hemolysis.

(especially in the morning); hemosiderinuria is seen days after hemolysis. C. Sucrose test is used to screen for disease; confirmatory test is the acidified serum test

or flow cytometry to detect lack of CD55 (DAF) on blood cells.

D. Main cause of death is thrombosis of the hepatic, portal, or cerebral veins.

1. Destroyed platelets release cytoplasmic contents into circulation, inducing
======================================
thrombosis.

E. Complications include iron deficiency anemia (due to chronic loss of hemoglobin in the urine) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which develops in 10% of patients.

II. GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (G6PD) DEFICIENCY

A. X-linked recessive disorder resulting in reduced half-life of G6PD; renders cells

susceptible to oxidative stress 1. RBCs are normally exposed to oxidative stress, in particular H2O2• 2. Glutathione (an antioxidant) neutralizes H2O2, but becomes oxidized in the

process.

3. NADPH, a by-product of G6PD, is needed to regenerate reduced glutathione. 4. ↓G6PD ↓→ NADPH ↓→ reduced glutathione → oxidative injury by H2O2

→ intravascular hemolysis

B. G6PD deficiency has two major variants.

1. African variant - mildly reduced half-life of G6PD leading to mild intravascular hemolysis with oxidative stress

2. Mediterranean variant - markedly reduced half-life of G6PD leading to marked intravascular hemolysis with oxidative stress

3. High carrier frequency in both populations is likely due to protective role against falciparum malaria.

C. Spleen also consumes some infected RBCs; results in mild extravascular hemolysis with splenomegaly

ANEMIA DUE TO UNDERPRODUCTION

A. Infects progenitor red cells and temporarily halts erythropoiesis; leads to significant anemia in the setting of preexisting marrow stress (e.g., sickle cell anemia).

B. Treatment is supportive (infection is self-limited).

III. APLASTIC ANEMIA

A. Damage to hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia) with low reticulocyte count

B. Etiologies include drugs or chemicals, viral infections, and autoimmune damage. C. Biopsy reveals an empty, fatty marrow (Fig. 5.15).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

D. Treatment includes cessation of any causative drugs and supportive care with transfusions and marrow-stimulating factors (e.g., erythropoietin, GM-CSF, and G-CSF). 1. Immunosuppression may be helpful as some idiopathic cases are due to

abnormal T-cell activation with release of cytokines.

2. May require bone marrow transplantation as a last resort

IV. MYELOPHTHISIC PROCESS

A. Pathologic process (e.g., metastatic cancer) that replaces bone marrow; hematopoiesis is impaired, resulting in pancytopenia.

White Blood Cell Disorders
======================================
LEUKOPENIA AND LEUKOCYTOSIS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Hematopoiesis occurs via a stepwise maturation of CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (Fig. 6.1).

B. Cells mature and are released from the bone marrow into the blood. C. A normal white blood cell (WBC) count is approximately 5-10 K/µL.

1. A low WBC count(< 5 K) is called leukopenia. 2. A high WBC count (> 10 K) is called leukocytosis. 3. A low or high WBC count is usually due to a decrease or increase in one

particular cell lineage.

II. LEUKOPENIA

A. Neutropenia refers to a decreased number of circulating neutrophils. Causes include 1. Drug toxicity (e.g., chemotherapy with alkylating agents) - Damage to stem cells results in decreased production of WBCs, especially neutrophils.

2. Severe infection (e.g., gram-negative sepsis) - Increased movement of neutrophils into tissues results in decreased circulating neutrophils.

3. As a treatment, GM-CSF or G-CSF may be used to boost granulocyte production, thereby decreasing risk of infection in neutropenic patients.

B. Lymphopenia refers to a decreased number of circulating lymphocytes. Causes

include 1. Immunodeficiency (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome or HIV) 2. High cortisol state (e.g., exogenous corticosteroids or Cushing syndrome)-

induces apoptosis of lymphocytes

3. Autoimmune destruction (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) 4. Whole body radiation - Lymphocytes are highly sensitive to radiation; lymphopenia is the earliest change to emerge after whole body radiation.

III. LEUKOCYTOSIS

A. Neutrophilic leukocytosis refers to increased circulating neutrophils. Causes include

1. Bacterial infection or tissue necrosis - induces release of marginated pool and bone marrow neutrophils, including immature forms (left shift); immature cells are characterized by decreased Fe receptors (CD16).

2. High cortisol state - impairs leukocyte adhesion, leading to release of marginated pool of neutrophils

B. Monocytosis refers to increased circulating monocytes. Causes include chronic inflammatory states (e.g., autoimmune and infectious) and malignancy.

C. Eosinophilia refers to increased circulating eosinophils. Causes include allergic reactions (type I hypersensitivity), parasitic infections, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Eosinophilia is driven by increased eosinophil chemotactic factor.

D. Basophilia refers to increased circulating basophils; classically seen in chronic myeloid leukemia

E. Lymphocytic leukocytosis refers to increased circulating lymphocytes. Causes

include 1. Viral infections - T lymphocytes undergo hyperplasia in response to virally

infected cells.

2. Bordetella pertussis infection - Bacteria produce lymphocytosis-promoting factor, which blocks circulating lymphocytes from leaving the blood to enter the lymph node.

IV. INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS (IM)

A. EBV infection that results in a lymphocytic leukocytosis comprised of reactive CD8+

T cells; CMV is a less common cause. 1. EBV is transmitted by saliva ("kissing disease"); classically affects teenagers

B. EBV primarily infects

1. Oropharynx, resulting in pharyngitis 2. Liver, resulting in hepatitis with hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes 3. B cells

C. CD8+ T-cell response leads to

1. Generalized lymphadenopathy (LAD) due to T-cell hyperplasia in the lymph node paracortex

2. Splenomegaly due to T-cell hyperplasia in the periarterial lymphatic sheath

(PALS)

3. High WBC count with atypical lymphocytes (reactive CD8+ T cells) in the blood (Fig. 6.2)

D. The monospot test is used for screening.

1. Detects IgM antibodies that cross-react with horse or sheep red blood cells (heterophile antibodies)

2. Usually turns positive within 1 week after infection 3. A negative monospot test suggests CMV as a possible cause of IM. 4. Definitive diagnosis is made by serologic testing for the EBV viral capsid antigen.

White Blood Cell Disorders
======================================
E. Complications

1. Increased risk for splenic rupture (Fig. 6.3); patients are generally advised to avoid contact sports for one month.

2. Rash if exposed to ampicillin 3. Dormancy of virus in B cells leads to increased risk for both recurrence and B-cell lymphoma, especially if immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV) develops.

ACUTE LEUKEMIA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Neoplastic proliferation of blasts; defined as the accumulation of > 20% blasts in the bone marrow.

B. Increased blasts "crowd-out" normal hematopoiesis, resulting in an "acute" presentation with anemia (fatigue), thrombocytopenia (bleeding), or neutropenia (infection).

C. Blasts usually enter the blood stream, resulting in a high WBC count. 1. Blasts are large, immature cells, often with punched out nucleoli (Fig. 6.4).

D. Acute leukemia is subdivided into acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) based on the phenotype of the blasts.

II. ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

A. Neoplastic accumulation of lymphoblasts ( > 20%) in the bone marrow

1. Lymphoblasts are characterized by positive nuclear staining for TdT, a DNA polymerase.

2. TdT is absent in myeloid blasts and mature lymphocytes.

B. Most commonly arises in children; associated with Down syndrome (usually arises after the age of 5 years)

C. Subclassified into B-ALL and T-ALL based on surface markers D. B-ALL is the most common type of ALL.

1. Usually characterized by lymphoblasts (TdT+) that express CD10, CD19, and

CD20.

2. Excellent response to chemotherapy; requires prophylaxis to scrotum and CSF (Fig. 6.5)

3. Prognosis is based on cytogenetic abnormalities.

i. ii.

t(12;21) has a good prognosis; more commonly seen in children t(9;22) has a poor prognosis; more commonly seen in adults (Philadelphia+ ALL)

E. T-ALL is characterized by lymphoblasts (TdT +) that express markers ranging from CD2 to CD8 (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD7). The blasts do not express CD10.

. Subclassification based on cytogenetic abnormalities, lineage of immature myeloid cells, and surface markers. High-yield subtypes include

cells, and surface markers. High-yield subtypes include 1. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)

i. Characterized by t(15;17), which involves translocation of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) on chromosome 17 to chromosome 15; RAR disruption blocks maturation and promyelocytes (blasts) accumulate.

ii. Abnormal promyelocytes contain numerous primary granules that increase the risk for DIC.

iii. Treatment is with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA, a vitamin A derivative), which binds the altered receptor and causes the blasts to mature (and eventually die). 2. Acute monocytic leukemia

i. Proliferation of monoblasts; usually lack MPO ii. Blasts characteristically infiltrate gums (Fig. 6.7).

3. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia

i. Proliferation of megakaryoblasts; lack MPO ii. Associated with Down syndrome (usually arises before the age of 5)

E. AML may also arise from pre-existing dysplasia (myelodysplastic syndromes),

especially with prior exposure to alkylating agents or radiotherapy. 1. Myelodysplastic syndromes usually present with cytopenias, hypercellular bone

marrow, abnormal maturation of cells, and increased blasts(< 20%).

2. Most patients die from infection or bleeding, though some progress to acute leukemia.

CHRONIC LEUKEMIA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature circulating lymphocytes; characterized by a high WBC count

small lymphocytic lymphoma.

D. Complications include

1. Hypogammaglobulinemia - Infection is the most common cause of death in CLL.

2. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia 3. Transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter transformation) -

marked clinically by an enlarging lymph node or spleen
======================================
III. HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature B cells characterized by hairy cytoplasmic processes (Fig. 6.9)

B. Cells are positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). C. Clinical features include splenomegaly (due to accumulation of hairy cells in red

pulp) and "dry tap" on bone marrow aspiration (due to marrow fibrosis). Lymphadenopathy is usually absent.

D. Excellent response to 2-CDA (cladribine), an adenosine deaminase inhibitor; adenosine accumulates to toxic levels in neoplastic B cells.

IV. ADULT T-CELL LEUKEMIA/LYMPHOMA (ATLL) A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature CD4 + T cells B. Associated with HTLV-1; most commonly seen in Japan and the Caribbean C. Clinical features include rash (skin infiltration), generalized lymphadenopathy

with hepatosplenomegaly, and lytic (punched-out) bone lesions with hypercalcemia.

V. MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature CD4+ T cells that infiltrate the skin, producing localized skin rash, plaques, and nodules. Aggregates of neoplastic cells in the epidermis are called Pautrier microabscesses.

B. Cells can spread to involve the blood, producing Sezary syndrome.

1. Characteristic lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei (Sezary cells) are seen on blood smear (Fig. 6.10).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS (MPD)

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

C. Complications include

1. 2. Progression to marrow fibrosis or transformation to acute leukemia

cells

II. CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA (CML)

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells, especially granulocytes and their precursors; basophils are characteristically increased (Fig. 6.11).

B. Driven by t(9;22) (Philadelphia chromosome) which generates a BCR-ABL fusion

protein with increased tyrosine kinase activity. 1. First line treatment is imatinib, which blocks tyrosine kinase activity.

C. Splenomegaly is common. Enlarging spleen suggests progression to accelerated phase

of disease; transformation to acute leukemia usually follows shortly thereafter. 1. Can transform to AML (2/3 of cases) or ALL (1/3 of cases) since mutation is in a

pluripotent stem cell.

LYMPHADENOPATHY (LAD)

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. LAD refers to enlarged lymph nodes.

1. Painful LAD is usually seen in lymph nodes that are draining a region of acute infection (acute lymphadenitis).

2. Painless LAD can be seen with chronic inflammation (chronic lymphadenitis), metastatic carcinoma, or lymphoma.

B. In inflammation, lymph node enlargement is due to hyperplasia of particular

regions of the lymph node (Fig. 6.15). 1. Follicular hyperplasia (B-cell region) is seen with rheumatoid arthritis and early

stages of HIV infection, for example.

1. BCL2 on chromosome 18 translocates to the Ig heavy chain locus on chromosome 14.

2. Results in overexpression of Bcl2, which inhibits apoptosis

D. Treatment is reserved for patients who are symptomatic and involves low-dose chemotherapy or rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody).

E. Progression to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is an important complication; presents as an enlarging lymph node

F. Follicular lymphoma is distinguished from reactive follicular hyperplasia by 1. Disruption of normal lymph node architecture (maintained in follicular

hyperplasia)

2. Lack of tingible body macrophages in germinal centers (tingible body

macrophages are present in follicular hyperplasia, Fig. 6.16B,C) 3. Bcl2 expression in follicles (not expressed in follicular hyperplasia) 4. Monoclonality (follicular hyperplasia is polyclonal)

III. MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA

A. Neoplastic proliferation of small B cells (CD20+) that expands the mantle zone B. Presents in late adulthood with painless lymphadenopathy C. Driven by t(11;14)

1. Cyclin D1 gene on chromosome 11 translocates to Ig heavy chain locus on chromosome 14.

2. Overexpression of cyclin D1 promotes G1/S transition in the cell cycle, facilitating neoplastic proliferation.

IV. MARGINAL ZONE LYMPHOMA

PLASMA CELL DISORDERS (DYSCRASIAS)

I. MULTIPLE MYELOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow

1. Most common primary malignancy of bone; metastatic cancer, however, is the most common malignant lesion of bone overall.

2. High serum IL-6 may be present; stimulates plasma cell growth and immunoglobulin production

B. Clinical features include

1. Bone pain with hypercalcemia - Neoplastic plasma cells activate the RANK receptor on osteoclasts, leading to bone destruction. Lytic, 'punched-out' skeletal lesions are seen on x-ray (Fig. 6.20A), especially in the vertebrae and skull; increased risk for fracture

2. Elevated serum protein - Neoplastic plasma cells produce immunoglobulin; M spike is present on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), most commonly due to monoclonal IgG or IgA.

3. Increased risk of infection - Monoclonal antibody lacks antigenic diversity; infection is the most common cause of death in multiple myeloma.

4. Rouleaux formation of RBCs on blood smear - Increased serum protein decreases charge between RBCs (Fig. 6.20B).

5. Primary AL amyloidosis - Free light chains circulate in serum and deposit in tissues.

6. Proteinuria - Free light chain is excreted in the urine as Bence Jones protein; deposition in kidney tubules leads to risk for renal failure (myeloma kidney).

II. MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY OF UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE (MGUS)

A. Increased serum protein with M spike on SPEP; other features of multiple myeloma are absent (e.g., no lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, AL amyloid, or Bence Jones proteinuria).

B. Common in elderly (seen in 5% of 70-year-old individuals); 1 % of patients with MGUS develop multiple myeloma each year.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Generalized lymphadenopathy; lytic bone lesions are absent. 2. Increased serum protein with M spike (comprised of IgM) 3. Visual and neurologic deficits (e.g., retinal hemorrhage or stroke) - IgM

(large pentamer) causes serum hyperviscosity.

4. Bleeding - Viscous serum results in defective platelet aggregation.

C. Acute complications are treated with plasmapheresis, which removes IgM from the serum.

Vascular Pathology

VASCULITIS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Inflammation of the blood vessel wall

1. Arterial wall is comprised of three layers: endothelial intima, smooth muscle

media, and connective tissue adventitia (Fig. 7.1). B. Etiology is usually unknown; most cases are not infectious. C. Clinical features include

1. Nonspecific symptoms of inflammation (e.g., fever, fatigue, weight loss, and myalgias)

2. Symptoms of organ ischemia - due to luminal narrowing or thrombosis of the inflamed vessels

D. Divided into large-, medium-, and small-vessel vasculitides

1. Large-vessel vasculitis involves the aorta and its major branches. 2. Medium-vessel vasculitis involves muscular arteries that supply organs. 3. Small-vessel vasculitis involves arterioles, capillaries, and venules.
======================================
II. LARGE-VESSEL VASCULITIS

A. Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis

1. Granulomatous vasculitis that classically involves branches of the carotid artery 2. Most common form of vasculitis in older adults (> 50 years); usually affects

females

3. Presents as headache (temporal artery involvement), visual disturbances (ophthalmic artery involvement), and jaw claudication. Flu-like symptoms with joint and muscle pain (polymyalgia rheumatica) are often present. ESR is elevated.

4. Biopsy reveals inflamed vessel wall with giant cells and intimal fibrosis (Fig. 7.2). i. Lesions are segmental; diagnosis requires biopsy of a long segment of vessel, and a negative biopsy does not exclude disease.

5. Treatment is corticosteroids; high risk of blindness without treatment

B. Takayasu Arteritis

1. Granulomatous vasculitis that classically involves the aortic arch at branch points

2. Presents in adults < 50 years old (classically, young Asian females) as visual and neurologic symptoms with a weak or absent pulse in the upper extremity ('pulseless disease'). ESR is elevated.

3. Treatment is corticosteroids.

III. MEDIUM-VESSEL VASCULITIS

A. Polyarteritis Nodosa

1. Necrotizing vasculitis involving multiple organs; lungs are spared. 2. Classically presents in young adults as hypertension (renal artery involvement),

abdominal pain with melena (mesenteric artery involvement), neurologic disturbances, and skin lesions. Associated with serum HBsAg

1. Classically affects Asian children < 4 years old 2. Presents with nonspecific signs including fever, conjunctivitis, erythematous

rash of palms and soles, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes

3. Coronary artery involvement is common and leads to risk for (1) thrombosis with myocardial infarction and (2) aneurysm with rupture.

4. Treatment is aspirin and IVIG; disease is self-limited.

C. Buerger Disease

1. Necrotizing vasculitis involving digits 2. Presents with ulceration, gangrene, and autoamputation of fingers and toes;

Raynaud phenomenon is often present.

3. Highly associated with heavy smoking; treatment is smoking cessation.
======================================
IV. SMALL-VESSEL VASCULITIS A. Wegener Granulomatosis

1. Necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis involving nasopharynx, lungs, and kidneys 2. Classic presentation is a middle-aged male with sinusitis or nasopharyngeal

ulceration, hemoptysis with bilateral nodular lung infiltrates, and hematuria due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.

3. Serum c-ANCA levels correlate with disease activity. 4. Biopsy reveals large necrotizing granulomas with adjacent necrotizing vasculitis

(Fig. 7.4).

5. Treatment is cyclophosphamide and steroids; relapses are common.

B. Microscopic Polyangiitis

1. Necrotizing vasculitis involving multiple organs, especially lung and kidney 2. Presentation is similar to Wegener granulomatosis, but nasopharyngeal

involvement and granulomas are absent.

3. Serum p-ANCA levels correlate with disease activity. 4. Treatment is corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide; relapses are common.

C. Churg-Strauss Syndrome

1. Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with eosinophils involving multiple organs, especially lungs and heart

2. Asthma and peripheral eosinophilia are often present. 3. Serum p-ANCA levels correlate with disease activity .

D. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura

1. Vasculitis due to IgA immune complex deposition; most common vasculitis in children

2. Presents with palpable purpura on buttocks and legs, GI pain and bleeding, and hematuria (IgA nephropathy); usually occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection

3. Disease is self-limited, but may recur; treated with steroids, if severe

HYPERTENSION (HTN)

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Increased blood pressure; may involve pulmonary (see chapter 9) or systemic circulation

B. Systemic HTN is defined as pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (normal ≤ 120/80 mm Hg); divided into primary or secondary types based on etiology

II. PRIMARY HTN

A. HTN of unknown etiology (95% of cases) B. Risk factors include age, race (increased risk in African Americans, decreased risk in

Asians), obesity, stress, lack of physical activity, and high-salt diet.
======================================
III. SECONDARY HTN

A. HTN due to an identifiable etiology (5% of cases) B. Renal artery stenosis is a common cause (renovascular hypertension).

1. Stenosis decreases blood flow to glomerulus. 2. Juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) responds by secreting renin, which converts

angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.

3. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).

4. ATII raises blood pressure by (1) contracting arteriolar smooth muscle, increasing total peripheral resistance and (2) promoting adrenal release of aldosterone, which increases resorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule (expanding plasma volume).

5. Leads to HTN with increased plasma renin and unilateral atrophy (due to low blood flow) of the affected kidney; neither feature is seen in primary hypertension.

C. Important causes of stenosis include atherosclerosis (elderly males) and fibromuscular dysplasia (young females).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a developmental defect of the blood vessel wall, resulting in irregular thickening of large- and medium-sized arteries, especially the renal artery.

IV. BENIGN AND MALIGNANT HTN

B. Benign HTN is a mild or moderate elevation in blood pressure; most cases of HTN are benign.

are benign. 1. Clinically silent; vessels and organs are damaged slowly over time.

C. Malignant HTN is severe elevation in blood pressure ( > 180/120 mm Hg); comprises

< 5% of cases 1. May arise from preexisting benign HTN or de novo 2. Presents with acute end-organ damage (e.g., acute renal failure, headache, and

papilledema) and is a medical emergency

ARTERIOSCLEROSIS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Literally, "hard arteries;" due to thickening of the blood vessel wall B. Three pathologic patterns - atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and Mönckeberg

medial calcific sclerosis
======================================
II. ATHEROSCLEROSIS

A. Intimal plaque that obstructs blood flow

1. Consists of a necrotic lipid core (mostly cholesterol) with a fibromuscular cap (Fig. 7.5); often undergoes dystrophic calcification

B. Involves large- and medium-sized arteries; abdominal aorta, coronary artery, popliteal artery, and internal carotid artery are commonly affected.

C. Risk factors for atherosclerosis are divided into modifiable and nonmodifiable. 1. Modifiable risk factors include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia (LDL increases risk; HDL decreases risk), smoking, and diabetes.

2. Nonmodifiable risk factors include age (number and severity of lesions increase with age), gender (increased risk in males and postmenopausal females; estrogen is protective), and genetics (multifactorial, but family history is highly predictive of risk). D. Pathogenesis

1. Damage to endothelium allows lipids to leak into the intima. 2. Lipids are oxidized and then consumed by macrophages via scavenger receptors,

resulting in foam cells.

Fig. 7.7 Hyaline arteriolosclerosis.

Fig. 7.8 Arteriolonephrosclerosis. (Courtesy of Jerome Taxy, MD)

Vascular Pathology

Inflammation and healing leads to deposition of extracellular matrix and proliferation of smooth muscle.

E. Morphologic stages

1. Begins as fatty streaks (flat yellow lesions of the intima consisting of lipid-laden macrophages); arise early in life (present in most teenagers)

2. Progresses to atherosclerotic plaque

F. Complications of atherosclerosis account for> 50% of disease in Western countries.

1. Stenosis of medium-sized vessels results in impaired blood flow and ischemia

leading to i. Peripheral vascular disease (lower extremity arteries, e.g., popliteal) ii. Angina (coronary arteries) iii.

2. Plaque rupture with thrombosis results in myocardial infarction (coronary arteries) and stroke (e.g., middle cerebral artery).

3. Plaque rupture with embolization results in atherosclerotic emboli, characterized by cholesterol crystals within the embolus (Fig. 7.6).

4. Weakening of vessel wall results in aneurysm (e.g., abdominal aorta).
======================================
Ill. ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS

A. Narrowing of small arterioles; divided into hyaline and hyperplastic types B. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is caused by proteins leaking into the vessel wall,

producing vascular thickening; proteins are seen as pink hyaline on microscopy (Fig. 7.7).

1. Consequence of long-standing benign hypertension or diabetes 2. Results in reduced vessel caliber with end-organ ischemia; classically produces glomerular scarring (arteriolonephrosclerosis, Fig. 7.8) that slowly progresses to chronic renal failure

C. Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis involves thickening of vessel wall by hyperplasia of smooth muscle ('onion-skin' appearance, Fig. 7.9).

1. Consequence of malignant hypertension 2. Results in reduced vessel caliber with end-organ ischemia 3. May lead to fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall with hemorrhage; classically

causes acute renal failure with a characteristic 'flea-bitten' appearance

IV. MÖNCKEBERG MEDIAL CALCIFIC SCLEROSIS

A. Calcification of the media of muscular (medium-sized) arteries; nonobstructive (Fig. 7.10A)

B. Not clinically significant; seen as an incidental finding on x-ray or mammography (Fig. 7.10B)

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

AORTIC DISSECTION AND ANEURYSM

I. AORTIC DISSECTION

A. Intimal tear with dissection of blood through media of the aortic wall (Fig. 7.11) B. Occurs in the proximal 10 cm of the aorta (high stress region) with preexisting

weakness of the media

C. Most common cause is hypertension (older adults); also associated with inherited

defects of connective tissue (younger individuals) 1. Hypertension results in hyaline arteriolosclerosis of the vasa vasorum; decreased

flow causes atrophy of the media.

2. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome classically lead to weakness of the connective tissue in the media (cystic medial necrosis).

D. Presents as sharp, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back E. Complications include pericardial tamponade (most common cause of death),

rupture with fatal hemorrhage, and obstruction of branching arteries (e.g., coronary or renal) with resultant end-organ ischemia.

II. THORACIC ANEURYSM

A. Balloon-like dilation of the thoracic aorta B. Due to weakness in the aortic wall. Classically seen in tertiary syphilis; endarteritis

of the vasa vasorum results in luminal narrowing, decreased flow, and atrophy of the vessel wall. Results in a 'tree-bark' appearance of the aorta (Fig. 7.12)

C. Major complication is dilation of the aortic valve root, resulting in aortic valve

insufficiency. 1. Other complications include compression of mediastinal structures (e.g., airway

or esophagus) and thrombosis/embolism.
======================================
III. ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM

A. Balloon-like dilation of the abdominal aorta; usually arises below the renal arteries, but above the aortic bifurcation (Fig. 7.13)

B. Primarily due to atherosclerosis; classically seen in male smokers > 60 years old with

hypertension 1. Atherosclerosis increases the diffusion barrier to the media, resulting in atrophy

and weakness of the vessel wall.

C. Presents as a pulsatile abdominal mass that grows with time D. Major complication is rupture, especially when > 5 cm in diameter; presents with

D. Major complication is rupture, especially when > 5 cm in diameter; presents with triad of hypotension, pulsatile abdominal mass, and flank pain

triad of hypotension, pulsatile abdominal mass, and flank pain 1. Other complications include compression of local structures (e.g., ureter) and

thrombosis/embolism.

VASCULAR TUMORS

I. HEMANGIOMA

A. Benign tumor comprised of blood vessels (Fig. 7.14) B. Commonly present at birth; often regresses during childhood C. Most often involves skin and liver

II. ANGIOSARCOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of endothelial cells; highly aggressive B. Common sites include skin, breast, and liver.

1. Liver angiosarcoma is associated with exposure to polyvinyl chloride, arsenic, and Thorotrast.

III. KAPOSI SARCOMA

A. Low-grade malignant proliferation of endothelial cells; associated with HHV-8 B. Presents as purple patches, plaques, and nodules on the skin (Fig. 7.15); may also

involve visceral organs

C. Classically seen in

1. Older Eastern European males - tumor remains localized to skin; treatment involves surgical removal.

2. AIDS - tumor spreads early; treatment is antiretroviral agents (to boost immune

system).

3. Transplant recipients - tumor spreads early; treatment involves decreasing immunosuppression.

Cardiac Pathology

ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE (IHD)

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Group of syndromes related to myocardial ischemia; IHD is the leading cause of death in the US.

B. Usually due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, which decreases blood flow to the

myocardium 1. Risk factors for IHD are similar to those of atherosclerosis; incidence increases

with age.

II. ANGINA

A. Stable angina is chest pain that arises with exertion or emotional stress.

1. Due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries with > 70% stenosis; decreased blood flow is not able to meet the metabolic demands of the myocardium during exertion.

2. Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 3. Presents as chest pain (lasting < 20 minutes) that radiates to the left arm or jaw,

diaphoresis, and shortness of breath

4. EKG shows ST-segment depression due to subendocardial ischemia. 5. Relieved by rest or nitroglycerin

B. Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs at rest.

1. Usually due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and

incomplete occlusion of a coronary artery (Fig. 8.1A). 2. Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 3. EKG shows ST-segment depression due to subendocardial ischemia. 4. Relieved by nitroglycerin 5. High risk of progression to myocardial infarction

RENE DH

C. Prinzmetal angina is episodic chest pain unrelated to exertion.

1. Due to coronary artery vasospasm 2. Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 3. EKG shows ST-segment elevation due to transmural ischemia. 4. Relieved by nitroglycerin or calcium channel blockers

III. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION A. Necrosis of cardiac myocytes B. Usually due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and complete

B. Usually due to rupture ofan atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and complete occlusion ofa coronary artery (Fig. 8.1B)

occlusion of a coronary artery (Fig. 8.1B) 1. Other causes include coronary artery vasospasm (due to Prinzmetal angina or

cocaine use), emboli, and vasculitis (e.g., Kawasaki disease).

C. Clinical features include severe, crushing chest pain (lasting > 20 minutes) that radiates to the left arm or jaw, diaphoresis, and dyspnea; symptoms are not relieved by nitroglycerin.

D. Infarction usually involves the left ventricle (LV); right ventricle (RV) and both atria are generally spared.
======================================
pathoma.com

73

74

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Occlusion of left anterior descending artery (LAD) leads to infarction of the anterior wall and anterior septum of the LV; LAD is the most commonly involved artery in MI (45% of cases).

2. Occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) leads to infarction of the posterior wall, posterior septum, and papillary muscles of the LV; RCA is the 2nd most commonly involved artery in MI.

3. Occlusion of left circumflex artery leads to infarction of lateral wall of the LV. E. Initial phase of infarction leads to subendocardial necrosis involving < 50% of the myocardial thickness (subendocardial infarction, Fig. 8.2); EKG shows ST-segment depression. 1. Continued or severe ischemia leads to transmural necrosis involving most of the myocardial wall (transmural infarction); EKG shows ST-segment elevation.

F. Laboratory tests detect elevated cardiac enzymes.

1. Troponin I is the most sensitive and specific marker (gold standard) for Ml. Levels rise 2-4 hours after infarction, peak at 24 hours, and return to normal by 7-10 days.

2. CK-MB is useful for detecting reinfarction that occurs days after an initial MI; creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) levels rise 4-6 hours after infarction, peak at 24 hours, and return to normal by 72 hours.

G. Treatment includes

1. Aspirin and/or heparin - limits thrombosis 2. Supplemental O2 - minimizes ischemia 3. Nitrates - Vasodilate veins and coronary arteries 4. β- blocker - slows heart rate, decreasing O2 demand and risk for arrhythmia 5. ACE inhibitor - decreases LV dilation 6. Fibrinolysis or angioplasty - opens blocked vessel

i. Reperfusion of irreversibly - damaged cells results in calcium influx, leading to hypercontraction of myofibrils (contraction band necrosis, Fig. 8.3).

ii. Return of oxygen and inflammatory cells may lead to free radical generation, further damaging myocytes (reperfusion injury).

H. Complications of myocardial infarction are closely related to gross and microscopic

changes (Table 8.1).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

IV. SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH

A. Unexpected death due to cardiac disease; occurs without symptoms or < 1 hour after

symptoms arise 1. Usually due to fatal ventricular arrhythmia

B. Most common etiology is acute ischemia; 90% of patients have preexisting severe

atherosclerosis. 1. Less common causes include mitral valve prolapse, cardiomyopathy, and cocaine

abuse.

V. CHRONIC ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

A. Poor myocardial function due to chronic ischemic damage (with or without infarction); progresses to congestive heart failure (CHF)

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF)

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Pump failure; divided into right- and left-sided failure

II. LEFT-SIDED HEART FAILURE

A. Causes include ischemia, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and restrictive cardiomyopathy.

B. Clinical features are due to decreased forward perfusion and pulmonary congestion. 1. Pulmonary congestion leads to pulmonary edema.

i. Results in dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (due to increased venous return when lying flat), orthopnea, and crackles

ii. Small, congested capillaries may burst, leading to intraalveolar hemorrhage; marked by hemosiderin-laden macrophages ('heart-failure' cells, Fig. 8.8)

2. Decreased flow to kidneys leads to activation of renin-angiotensin system.

i. Fluid retention exacerbates CHF. C. Mainstay of treatment is ACE inhibitor.
======================================
III. RIGHT-SIDED HEART FAILURE

A. Most commonly due to left-sided heart failure; other important causes include left- to-right shunt and chronic lung disease (cor pulmonale).

B. Clinical features are due to congestion. Jugular venous distension

1. 2. Painful hepatosplenomegaly with characteristic 'nutmeg' liver (Fig. 8.9); may lead

to cardiac cirrhosis

3. Dependent pitting edema (due to increased hydrostatic pressure)

CONGENITAL DEFECTS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Arise during embryogenesis (usually weeks 3 through 8); seen in 1% of live births 1. Most defects are sporadic.

B. Often result in shunting between left (systemic) and right (pulmonary) circulations. C. Defects with left-to-right shunting may be relatively asymptomatic at birth, but the

C. Defects with left-to-right shunting may be relatively asymptomatic at birth, but the shunt can eventually reverse.

shunt can eventually reverse. 1. Increased flow through the pulmonary circulation results in hypertrophy of

pulmonary vessels and pulmonary hypertension.

2. Increased pulmonary resistance eventually results in reversal of shunt, leading to late cyanosis (Eisenmenger syndrome) with right ventricular hypertrophy, polycythemia, and clubbing.

D. Defects with right-to-left shunting usually present as cyanosis shortly after birth.

II. VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT (VSD)

A. Defect in the septum that divides the right and left ventricles

1. Most common congenital heart defect 2. Associated with fetal alcohol syndrome

B. Results in left-to-right shunt; size of defect determines extent of shunting and age at presentation. Small defects are often asymptomatic; large defects can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome.

C. Treatment involves surgical closure; small defects may close spontaneously.

III. ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)

A. Defect in the septum that divides right and left atria; most common type is ostium secundum (90% of cases).

B. Ostium primum type is associated with Down syndrome. C. Results in left-to-right shunt and split S2 on auscultation (increased blood in right

heart delays closure of pulmonary valve)

D. Paradoxical emboli are an important complication.

IV. PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS (PDA)

A. Failure of ductus arteriosus to close; associated with congenital rubella B. Results in left-to-right shunt between the aorta and the pulmonary artery

1. During development, the ductus arteriosus normally shunts blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs.

C. Asymptomatic at birth with continuous 'machine-like' murmur; may lead to Eisenmenger syndrome, resulting in lower extremity cyanosis

D. Treatment involves indomethacin, which decreases PGE, resulting in PDA closure (PGE maintains patency of the ductus arteriosus).
======================================
V. TETRALOGY OF FALLOT

A. Characterized by (1) stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, (2) right ventricular hypertrophy, (3) VSD, and (4) an aorta that overrides the VSD

B. Right-to-left shunt leads to early cyanosis; degree of stenosis determines the extent of shunting and cyanosis.

C. Patients learn to squat in response to a cyanotic spell; increased arterial resistance decreases shunting and allows more blood to reach the lungs.

D. 'Boot-shaped' heart on x-ray (Fig. 8.10)

II. ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER

A. Systemic complication of pharyngitis due to group A β- hemolytic streptococci; affects

children 2-3 weeks after an episode of streptococcal pharyngitis ("strep throat") B. Caused by molecular mimicry; bacterial M protein resembles proteins in human

tissue.

C. Diagnosis is based on Jones criteria.

1. Evidence of prior group A β- hemolytic streptococcal infection (e.g., elevated ASO

or anti-DNase B titers) with the presence of major and minor criteria 2. Minor criteria are nonspecific and include fever and elevated ESR. 3. Major criteria

i. Migratory polyarthritis - swelling and pain in a large joint (e.g., wrist, knees, ankles) that resolves within days and "migrates" to involve another large joint

ii. Pancarditis

a. Endocarditis - Mitral valve is involved more commonly than the aortic valve. Characterized by small vegetations along lines of closure that lead to regurgitation (Fig. 8.12A)

b. Myocarditis with Aschoff bodies that are characterized by foci of chronic inflammation, reactive histiocytes with slender, wavy nuclei (Anitschkow cells), giant cells, and fibrinoid material (Fig. 8.12B,C); myocarditis is the most common cause of death during the acute phase.

D. Acute attack usually resolves, but may progress to chronic rheumatic heart disease; repeat exposure to group A β- hemolytic streptococci results in relapse of the acute phase and increases risk for chronic disease.

III. CHRONIC RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE

A. Valve scarring that arises as a consequence of rheumatic fever B. Results in stenosis with a classic 'fish-mouth' appearance

1. Almost always involves the mitral valve; leads to thickening of chordae tendineae and cusps

2. Occasionally involves the aortic valve; leads to fusion of the commissures (Fig. 8.13)

3. Other valves are less commonly involved.

C. Complications include infectious endocarditis.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

IV. AORTIC STENOSIS

A. Narrowing of the aortic valve orifice (Fig. 8.14) B. Usually due to fibrosis and calcification from "wear and tear"

1. Presents in late adulthood ( > 60 years) 2. Bicuspid aortic valve increases risk and hastens disease onset. A normal aortic valve has three cusps; fewer cusps results in increased "wear and tear" on each cusp.

C. May also arise as a consequence of chronic rheumatic valve disease; coexisting mitral stenosis and fusion of the aortic valve commissures distinguish rheumatic disease from "wear and tear."

D. Cardiac compensation leads to a prolonged asymptomatic stage during which a systolic ejection click followed by a crescendo-decrescendo murmur is heard.

E. Complications include

1. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy - may progress to cardiac failure 2. Angina and syncope with exercise - Limited ability to increase blood flow across the stenotic valve leads to decreased perfusion of the myocardium and brain.

3. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia - RBCs are damaged (producing schistocytes) while crossing the calcified valve.

F. Treatment is valve replacement after onset of complications.
======================================
V. AORTIC REGURGITATION

A. Backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole B. Arises due to aortic root dilation (e.g., syphilitic aneurysm and aortic dissection) or valve damage (e.g., infectious endocarditis); most common cause is isolated root dilation

C. Clinical features include

1. Early, blowing diastolic murmur 2. Hyperdynamic circulation due to increased pulse pressure

i. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. ii. Diastolic pressure decreases due to regurgitation, while systolic pressure

increases due to increased stroke volume.

iii. Presents with bounding pulse (water-hammer pulse), pulsating nail bed (Quincke pulse), and head bobbing

3. Results in LV dilation and eccentric hypertrophy (due to volume overload)

D. Treatment is valve replacement once LV dysfunction develops.

VI. MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE

A. Ballooning of mitral valve into left atrium during systole 1. Seen in 2-3% of US adults

Klebsiella pneumoniae (Table 9.1)

C. Classic gross phases of lobar pneumonia

1. Congestion - due to congested vessels and edema 2. Red hepatization - due to exudate, neutrophils, and hemorrhage filling the alveolar

air spaces, giving the normally spongy lung a solid consistency (Fig. 9.3B,C)

3. Gray hepatization - due to degradation of red cells within the exudate 4. Resolution

C. Classically results in a right lower lobe abscess

1. Anatomically, the right main stem bronchus branches at a less acute angle than the left.

VI. TUBERCULOSIS (TB)

A. Due to inhalation of aerosolized Mycobacterium tuberculosis B. Primary TB arises with initial exposure.

1. Results in focal, caseating necrosis in the lower lobe of the lung and hilar lymph nodes that undergoes fibrosis and calcification, forming a Ghon complex (Fig. 9.6A)

2. Primary TB is generally asymptomatic, but leads to a positive PPD.

C. Secondary TB arises with reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

1. Reactivation is commonly due to AIDS; may also be seen with aging 2. Occurs at apex of lung (relatively poor lymphatic drainage and high oxygen

tension)

3. Forms cavitary foci of caseous necrosis; may also lead to miliary pulmonary TB or tuberculous bronchopneumonia

4. Clinical features include fevers and night sweats, cough with hemoptysis, and weight loss.

5. Biopsy reveals caseating granulomas; AFB stain reveals acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 9.6B,C).

6. Systemic spread often occurs and can involve any tissue; common sites include meninges (meningitis), cervical lymph nodes, kidneys (sterile pyuria), and lumbar vertebrae (Pott disease).

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Group of diseases characterized by airway obstruction; lung does not empty, and air

is trapped. 1. Volume of air that can be forcefully expired is decreased ( ↓FVC), especially during the first second of expiration (↓↓FEV1); results in ↓FEV1:FVC ratio

2. Total lung capacity (TLC) is usually increased due to air trapping.

II. CHRONIC BRONCHITIS

A. Chronic productive cough lasting at least 3 months over a minimum of 2 years; highly associated with smoking

B. Characterized by hypertrophy of bronchial mucous glands (Fig. 9.7)

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Leads to increased thickness of mucus glands relative to bronchial wall thickness (Reid index increases to > 50%; normal is < 40%).

C. Clinical features

1. Productive cough due to excessive mucus production

2. Cyanosis ('blue bloaters') - Mucus plugs trap carbon dioxide; ↑Paco2

Increased risk of infection and cor pulmonale

III. EMPHYSEMA

A. Destruction of alveolar air sacs (Fig. 9.8)

Loss of elastic recoil and collapse of airways during exhalation results in obstruction and air trapping.

1.

B. Due to imbalance of proteases and antiproteases

Inflammation in the lung normally leads to release of proteases by neutrophils and macrophages.

2. α 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) neutralizes proteases. 3. Excessive inflammation or lack of A1AT leads to destruction of the alveolar air

sacs.

C. Smoking is the most common cause of emphysema.

1. Pollutants in smoke lead to excessive inflammation and protease-mediated

damage.

2. Results in centriacinar emphysema that is most severe in the upper lobes

D. A1AT deficiency is a rare cause of emphysema.

1. Lack of antiprotease leaves the air sacs vulnerable to protease-mediated damage. 2. Results in panacinar emphysema that is most severe in the lower lobes 3. Liver cirrhosis may also be present.

i. Al AT deficiency is due to misfolding of the mutated protein. ii. Mutant A1AT accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes,

resulting in liver damage.

iii. Biopsy reveals pink, PAS-positive globules in hepatocytes (Fig. 9.9).

4. Disease severity is based on the degree of AlAT deficiency.

i. PiM is the normal allele; two copies are usually expressed (PiMM). ii. PiZ is the most common clinically relevant mutation; results in significantly

low levels of circulating A1AT

iii. PiMZ heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic with decreased circulating levels of A1AT; however, significant risk for emphysema with smoking exists.

iv. PiZZ homozygotes are at significant risk for panacinar emphysema and cirrhosis.

IV. ASTHMA

A. Reversible airway bronchoconstriction, most often due to allergic stimuli (atopic asthma) B. Presents in childhood; often associated with allergic rhinitis, eczema, and a family

history of atopy

C. Pathogenesis (type I hypersensitivity)

1. Allergens induce TH2 2. phenotype in CD4 + T cells of genetically susceptible individuals. 3. T H2 cells secrete IL-4 (mediates class switch to IgE), IL-5 (attracts eosinophils),

and IL-10 (stimulates T H2 cells and inhibits TH1).

4. Reexposure to allergen leads to IgE-mediated activation of mast cells.

i. Release of preformed histamine granules and generation of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 lead to bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and edema (early- phase reaction). Inflammation, especially major basic protein derived from eosinophils, damages cells and perpetuates bronchoconstriction (late-phase reaction).

D. Clinical features are episodic and related to allergen exposure.

1. Dyspnea and wheezing 2. Productive cough, classically with spiral-shaped mucus plugs (Curschmann spirals) and eosinophil-derived crystals (Charcot-Leyden crystals, Fig. 9.11).

3. Severe, unrelenting attack can result in status asthmaticus and death.

E. Asthma may also arise from nonallergic causes (non-atopic asthma) such as exercise, viral infection, aspirin (e.g., aspirin intolerant asthma), and occupational exposures.

V. BRONCHIECTASIS

A. Permanent dilatation of bronchi (Fig. 9.12); loss of airway tone results in air trapping. B. Due to severe inflammation with damage to airway walls. Causes include

Due to severe inflammation with damage to airway walls. Causes include 1 Cystic fibrosis

C. Clinical features

1. Progressive dyspnea and cough 2. Bilateral fibrosis on lung CT; initially seen in subpleural patches, but eventually

results in extensive fibrosis with end-stage 'honeycomb' lung

C. Chronic exposure leads to interstitial fibrosis.

PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. High pressure in the pulmonary circuit (mean arterial pressure > 25 mm Hg; normal is 10 mm Hg)

B. Characterized by atherosclerosis of the pulmonary trunk, smooth muscle hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries, and intimal fibrosis; plexiform lesions are seen with severe, long-standing disease (Fig. 9.16).

C. Leads to right ventricular hypertrophy with eventual cor pulmonale D. Presents with exertional dyspnea or right-sided heart failure E. Subclassified as primary or secondary based on etiology

II. PRIMARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION A. Classically seen in young adult females B. Etiology is unknown; some familial forms are related to inactivating mutations of

BMPR2, leading to proliferation of vascular smooth muscle.
======================================
III. SECONDARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

A. Due to hypoxemia (e.g., COPD and interstitial lung disease) or increased volume in the pulmonary circuit (e.g., congenital heart disease); may also arise with recurrent pulmonary embolism

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROMES

I. ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

A. Diffuse damage to the alveolar-capillary interface (diffuse alveolar damage) B. Leakage of protein-rich fluid leads to edema that combines with necrotic epithelial

cells to form hyaline membranes lining alveoli (Fig. 9.17A).

C. Clinical features

1. Hypoxemia and cyanosis with respiratory distress - due to thickened diffusion

barrier and collapse of air sacs (increased surface tension) 'White-out' on chest x-ray (Fig. 9.17B)

2

D. Secondary to a variety of disease processes including sepsis, infection, shock, trauma, aspiration, pancreatitis, DIC, hypersensitivity reactions, and drugs.

Fig. 9.17 ARDS. A, Hyaline membranes. B, 'White-out' of lung on x-ray. (B, Courtesy of Samir, GNU- FDL vl.2)

Respiratory Tract Pathology

1. Activation of neutrophils induces protease- and free radical-mediated damage of type I and II pneumocytes.

E. Treatment

1. Address underlying cause 2. Ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)

F. Recovery may be complicated by interstitial fibrosis; damage and loss of type II pneumocytes leads to scarring and fibrosis.

II. NEONATAL RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME A. Respiratory distress due to inadequate surfactant levels

1. Surfactant is made by type II pneumocytes; phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) is the major component.

2. Surfactant decreases surface tension in the lung, preventing collapse of alveolar air sacs after expiration.

3. Lack of surfactant leads to collapse of air sacs and formation of hyaline

membranes. B. Associated with

1. Prematurity - Surfactant production begins at 28 weeks; adequate levels are not

reached until 34 weeks. i. Amniotic fluid lecithin to sphingomyelin ratio is used to screen for lung

maturity.

ii. Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) levels increase as surfactant is produced; sphingomyelin remains constant.

iii. A ratio > 2 indicates adequate surfactant production.

2. Caesarian section delivery - due to lack of stress-induced steroids; steroids increase synthesis of surfactant.

3. Maternal diabetes - Insulin decreases surfactant production.

C. Clinical features

1. Increasing respiratory effort after birth, tachypnea with use of accessory muscles, and grunting

2. Hypoxemia with cyanosis 3. Diffuse granularity of the lung ('ground-glass' appearance) on x-ray (Fig. 9.18)

3 Diffuse granularity of the lung (‘ground-glass' appearance) on x-ray (Fig. 9.18) Complications
======================================
D. Complications

1. Hypoxemia increases the risk for persistence of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis.

2. Supplemental oxygen increases the risk for free radical injury. Retinal injury leads to blindness; lung damage leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

LUNG CANCER

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Most common cause of cancer mortality in the US; average age at presentation is 60 years.

B. Key risk factors are cigarette smoke, radon, and asbestos.

1. Cigarette smoke contains over 60 carcinogens; 85% of lung cancer occurs in

smokers. i. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and arsenic are particularly mutagenic. ii. Cancer risk is directly related to the duration and amount of smoking

ii Cancer risk is directly related to the duration and amount of smoking (‘pack-years’).

I. CLEFT LIP AND PALATE

A. Full-thickness defect of lip or palate (Fig. 10.1) B. Due to failure of facial prominences to fuse

1. During early pregnancy, facial prominences (one from superior, two from the sides, and two from inferior) grow and fuse together to form the face.

C. Cleft lip and palate usually occur together; isolated cleft lip or palate is less common.

II. APHTHOUS ULCER

A. Painful, superficial ulceration of the oral mucosa (Fig. 10.2) B. Arises in relation to stress and resolves spontaneously, but often recurs C. Characterized by a grayish base surrounded by erythema

III. BEHÇET SYNDROME

A. Recurrent aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis B. Due to immune complex vasculitis involving small vessels C. Can be seen after viral infection, but etiology is unknown

IV. ORAL HERPES

A. Vesicles involving oral mucosa that rupture, resulting in shallow, painful, red ulcers B. Usually due to HSV-1 C. Primary infection occurs in childhood; lesions heal, but virus remains dormant in

ganglia of the trigeminal nerve.

D. Stress and sunlight cause reactivation of the virus, leading to vesicles that often arise on the lips (cold sore, Fig. 10.3).
======================================
V. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

A. Malignant neoplasm of squamous cells lining the oral mucosa B. Tobacco and alcohol are major risk factors. C. Floor of mouth is the most common location. D. Oral leukoplakia and erythroplakia are precursor lesions.

1. Leukoplakia is a white plaque that cannot be scraped away; often represents squamous cell dysplasia

2. Leukoplakia is distinct from oral candidiasis (thrush) and hairy leukoplakia. i. Oral candidiasis is a white deposit on the tongue, which is easily scraped

away (Fig. 10.4); usually seen in immunocompromised states

ii. Hairy leukoplakia is a white, rough ('hairy') patch that arises on the lateral tongue. It is usually seen in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., AIDS) and is due to EBY-induced squamous cell hyperplasia; not pre-malignant 3. Erythroplakia (red plaque) represents vascularized leukoplakia and is highly

suggestive of squamous cell dysplasia.

4. Erythroplakia and leukoplakia are often biopsied to rule out carcinoma.

SALIVARY GLAND

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Salivary glands are exocrine glands that secrete saliva. B. Divided into major (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands) and minor

glands (hundreds of microscopic glands distributed throughout the oral mucosa)

II. MUMPS

A. Infection with mumps virus resulting in bilateral inflamed parotid glands B. Orchitis, pancreatitis, and aseptic meningitis may also be present.

1. Serum amylase is increased due to salivary gland or pancreatic involvement. 2. Orchitis carries risk of sterility, especially in teenagers.

III. SIALADENITIS

A. Inflammation of the salivary gland B. Most commonly due to an obstructing stone (sialolithiasis) leading to Staphylococcus

aureus infection; usually unilateral

IV. PLEOMORPHIC ADENOMA

A. Benign tumor composed of stromal (e.g., cartilage) and epithelial tissue; most common tumor of the salivary gland

B. Usually arises in parotid; presents as a mobile, painless, circumscribed mass at the angle of the jaw

C. High rate of recurrence; extension of small islands of tumor through tumor capsule often leads to incomplete resection (Fig. 10.5).

D. Rarely may transform into carcinoma, which presents with signs of facial nerve damage (facial nerve runs through parotid gland)
======================================
V. WARTHIN TUMOR

A. Benign cystic tumor with abundant lymphocytes and germinal centers (lymph node- like stroma); 2nd most common tumor of the salivary gland

B. Almost always arises in the parotid

VI. MUCOEPIDERMOID CARCINOMA

A. Malignant tumor composed of mucinous and squamous cells; most common malignant tumor of the salivary gland

B. Usually arises in the parotid; commonly involves the facial nerve

II. ESOPHAGEAL WEB

A. Thin protrusion of esophageal mucosa, most often in the upper esophagus B. Presents with dysphagia for poorly chewed food C. Increased risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma D. Plummer-Vinson syndrome is characterized by severe iron deficiency anemia,

esophageal web, and beefy-red tongue due to atrophic glossitis.

III. ZENKER DIVERTICULUM

A. Outpouching of pharyngeal mucosa through an acquired defect in the muscular wall (false diverticulum)

B. Arises above the upper esophageal sphincter at the junction of the esophagus and pharynx

C. Presents with dysphagia, obstruction, and halitosis (bad breath)

IV. MALLORY-WEISS SYNDROME

mediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema
======================================
V. ESOPHAGEAL VARICES

A. Dilated submucosal veins in the lower esophagus B. Arise secondary to portal hypertension

1. Distal esophageal vein normally drains into the portal vein via the left gastric vein.

2. In portal hypertension, the left gastric vein backs up into the esophageal vein,

resulting in dilation (varices). C. Asymptomatic, but risk of rupture exists

1. Presents with painless hematemesis 2. Most common cause of death in cirrhosis

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

IV. ACUTE GASTRITIS

A. Acidic damage to the stomach mucosa B. Due to imbalance between mucosal defenses and acidic environment

1. Defenses include mucin layer produced by foveolar cells, bicarbonate secretion by surface epithelium, and normal blood supply (provides nutrients and picks up leaked acid).

C. Risk factors

1. Severe burn (Curling ulcer) - Hypovolemia leads to decreased blood supply. 2. NSAIDs (decreased PGE) 3. Heavy alcohol consumption 4. Chemotherapy 5.

Increased intracranial pressure (Cushing ulcer) - Increased stimulation of vagus nerve leads to increased acid production.

6. Shock - Multiple (stress) ulcers may be seen in ICU patients.

D. Acid damage results in superficial inflammation, erosion (loss of superficial epithelium), or ulcer (loss of mucosal layer).

V. CHRONIC GASTRITIS

A. Chronic inflammation of stomach mucosa B. Divided into two types based on underlying etiology: chronic autoimmune gastritis

and chronic H pylori gastritis

C. Chronic autoimmune gastritis is due to autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells, which are located in the stomach body and fundus.

1. Associated with antibodies against parietal cells and/or intrinsic factor; useful for diagnosis, but pathogenesis is mediated by T cells (type IV hypersensitivity) 2. Clinical features

i. Atrophy of mucosa with intestinal metaplasia (Fig. 10.11) ii. Achlorhydria with increased gastrin levels and antral G-cell hyperplasia iii. Megaloblastic (pernicious) anemia due to lack of intrinsic factor iv. Increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma (intestinal type)

D. Chronic H pylori gastritis is due to H pylori-induced acute and chronic

inflammation; most common form of gastritis (90%) 1. H pylori ureases and proteases along with inflammation weaken mucosal

defenses; antrum is the most common site (Fig. 10.12).

2. Presents with epigastric abdominal pain; increased risk for ulceration (peptic ulcer disease), gastric adenocarcinoma (intestinal type), and MALT lymphoma

3. Treatment involves triple therapy.

i. Resolves gastritis/ulcer and reverses intestinal metaplasia ii. Negative urea breath test and lack of stool antigen confirm eradication of H

pylori.

reflux. 1. Presents with epigastric pain that worsens with meals 2. Ulcer is usually located on the lesser curvature of the antrum. 3. Rupture carries risk of bleeding from left gastric artery.

D. Differential diagnosis of ulcers includes carcinoma.

1. Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant (duodenal carcinoma is extremely rare).

2. Gastric ulcers can be caused by gastric carcinoma (intestinal subtype). i. Benign peptic ulcers are usually small(< 3 cm), sharply demarcated

i. Benign peptic ulcers are usually small(< 3 cm), sharply demarcated ("punched-out"), and surrounded by radiating folds of mucosa (Fig. 10.13A).

("punched-out"), and surrounded by radiating folds of mucosa (Fig. 10.13A). ii. Malignant ulcers are large and irregular with heaped up margins (Fig. 10.13B) iii. Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.

VII. GASTRIC CARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of surface epithelial cells (adenocarcinoma) B. Subclassified into intestinal and diffuse types C. Intestinal type (more common) presents as a large, irregular ulcer with heaped up margins; most commonly involves the lesser curvature of the antrum (similar to gastric ulcer) 1. Risk factors include intestinal metaplasia (e.g., due to H pylori and autoimmune

gastritis), nitrosamines in smoked foods (Japan), and blood type A.

D. Diffuse type is characterized by signet ring cells that diffusely infiltrate the gastric

wall (Fig. 10.14B); desmoplasia results in thickening of stomach wall (linitis plastica, Fig. 10.14A). 1. Not associated with H pylori, intestinal metaplasia, or nitrosamines

E. Gastric carcinoma presents late with weight loss, abdominal pain, anemia, and early satiety; rarely presents as acanthosis nigricans or Leser-Trélat sign

F. Spread to lymph nodes can involve the left supraclavicular node (Virchow node). G. Distant metastasis most commonly involves liver; other sites include

1. Periumbilical region (Sister Mary Joseph nodule); seen with intestinal type

1. Polyhydramnios 2. Distension of stomach and blind loop of duodenum ('double bubble' sign, Fig.

10.15)

3. Bilious vomiting

II. MECKEL DIVERTICULUM

A. Outpouching of all three layers of the bowel wall (true diverticulum, Fig. 10.16) B. Arises due to failure of the vitelline duct to involute C.

'Rule of 2s' 1. Seen in 2% of the population (most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract) 2. 2 inches long and located in the small bowel within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve 3. Can present during the first 2 years of life with bleeding (due to heterotopic

gastric mucosa), volvulus, intussusception, or obstruction (mimics appendicitis); however, most cases are asymptomatic.

III. VOLVULUS

A. Twisting of bowel along its mesentery B. Results in obstruction and disruption of the blood supply with infarction (Fig. 10.17) C. Most common locations are sigmoid colon (elderly) and cecum (young adults).

IV.

INTUSSUSCEPTION A. Telescoping of proximal segment of bowel forward into distal segment

1. Telescoped segment is pulled forward by peristalsis, resulting in obstruction and disruption of blood supply with infarction.

B. Associated with a leading edge (focus of traction)

1.

2.

In children, the most common cause is lymphoid hyperplasia (e.g., due to rotavirus); usually arises in the terminal ileum, leading to intussusception into the cecum In adults, the most common cause is tumor.

V. SMALL BOWEL INFARCTION

A. Small bowel is highly susceptible to ischemic injury.

Fig. 10.16 Meckel diverticulum. (Courtesy of hum path.corn)

Fig. 10.17 Infarction due to volvulus. (Courtesy of humpath.com)

Gastrointestinal Pathology

1. Transmural infarction occurs with thrombosis/embolism of the superior mesenteric artery or thrombosis of the mesenteric vein.

2. Mucosal infarction occurs with marked hypotension.

B. Clinical features include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and decreased bowel sounds.
======================================
VI. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE

A. Decreased function of the lactase enzyme found in the brush border of enterocytes 1. Lactase normally breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose.

B. Presents with abdominal distension and diarrhea upon consumption of milk products; undigested lactose is osmotically active.

C. Deficiency may be congenital (rare autosomal recessive disorder) or acquired (often develops in late childhood); temporary deficiency is seen after small bowel infection (lactase is highly susceptible to injury).

VII. CELIAC DISEASE

A. Immune-mediated damage of small bowel villi due to gluten exposure; associated with HLA-DQ2 and DQ8

B. Gluten is present in wheat and grains; its most pathogenic component is gliadin. 1. Once absorbed, gliadin is deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG). 2. Deamidated gliadin is presented by antigen presenting cells via MHC class II. 3. Helper T cells mediate tissue damage.

C. Clinical presentation

1. Children classically present with abdominal distension, diarrhea, and failure to thrive.

2. Adults classically present with chronic diarrhea and bloating. 3. Small, herpes-like vesicles may arise on skin (dermatitis herpetiformis). Due to IgA deposition at the tips of dermal papillae; resolves with gluten-free diet

3 Small, herpes-like vesicles may arise on skin (dermatitis herpetiformis). Due to IgA deposition at the tips of dermal papillae; resolves with gluten-free diet Laboratory findings

D. Laboratory findings

1. IgA antibodies against endomysium, tTG, or gliadin; IgG antibodies are also present and are useful for diagnosis in individuals with IgA deficiency (increased incidence of Ig A deficiency is seen in celiac disease).

2. Duodenal biopsy reveals flattening of villi, hyperplasia of crypts, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (Fig. 10.18). Damage is most prominent in the duodenum; jejunum and ileum are less involved.

E. Symptoms resolve with gluten-free diet.

1. Small bowel carcinoma and T-cell lymphoma are late complications that present as refractory disease despite good dietary control.

1. Associated with constipation, straining, and low-fiber diet; commonly seen in older adults (risk increases with age)

2. Arise where the vasa recta traverse the muscularis propria (weak point in colonic wall); sigmoid colon is the most common location.

C. Usually asymptomatic; complications include

1. Rectal bleeding (hematochezia) 2. Diverticulitis - due to obstructing fecal material; presents with appendicitis-like

symptoms in the left lower quadrant

3. Fistula - Inflamed diverticulum ruptures and attaches to a local structure. Colovesicular fistula presents with air (or stool) in urine.

III. ANGIODYSPLASIA

Gastrointestinal Pathology

IX. JUVENILE POLYP

A. Sporadic, hamartomatous (benign) polyp that arises in children(< 5 years) 1. Usually presents as a solitary rectal polyp that prolapses and bleeds B. Juvenile polyposis is characterized by multiple juvenile polyps in the stomach and colon; large numbers of juvenile polyps increase the risk of progression to carcinoma.

X. PEUTZ-JEGHERS SYNDROME

A. Hamartomatous (benign) polyps throughout GI tract and mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation (freckle-like spots) on lips, oral mucosa, and genital skin; autosomal dominant disorder

B. Increased risk for colorectal, breast, and gynecologic cancer

XI. COLORECTAL CARCINOMA

A. Carcinoma arising from colonic or rectal mucosa; 3rd most common site of cancer

and 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death 1. Peak incidence is 60-70 years of age.

B. Most commonly arises from adenoma-carcinoma sequence; a second important

molecular pathway is microsatellite instability (MSI). 1. Microsatellites are repeating sequences of noncoding DNA; integrity of sequence

(stability) is maintained during cell division.

2. Instability indicates defective DNA copy mechanisms (e.g., DNA mismatch repair enzymes).

3. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) is due to inherited

mutations in DNA mismatch repair enzymes. i. ii. Colorectal carcinoma arises de novo (not from adenomatous polyps) at a

Increased risk for colorectal, ovarian, and endometrial carcinoma

relatively early age; usually right-sided

C. Screening for colorectal carcinoma occurs via colonoscopy and fecal occult blood

testing; begins at 50 years of age 1. Goal is to remove adenomatous polyps before carcinoma develops and to detect

cancer early (before clinical symptoms arise).

D. Carcinoma can develop anywhere along entire length of colon.

1. Left-sided carcinoma usually grows as a 'napkin-ring' lesion; presents with decreased stool caliber, left lower quadrant pain, and blood-streaked stool 2. Right-sided carcinoma usually grows as a raised lesion; presents with iron-

deficiency anemia (occult bleeding) and vague pain. An older adult with iron deficiency anemia has colorectal carcinoma until proven otherwise. E. Colonic carcinoma is associated with an increased risk for Streptococcus bovis

endocarditis.

F. Staging

1. T - depth of invasion; tumors limited to the mucosa generally do not spread due

to lack of lymphatics in the mucosa. 2. N - spread to regional lymph nodes 3. M - distant spread; most commonly involves the liver

G. CEA is a serum tumor marker that is useful for assessing treatment response and detecting recurrence; not useful for screening

EXOCRINE PANCREAS

I. ANNULAR PANCREAS

A. Developmental malformation in which the pancreas forms a ring around the duodenum; risk of duodenal obstruction

II. ACUTE PANCREATITIS

A. Inflammation and hemorrhage of the pancreas B. Due to autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma by pancreatic enzymes

B. Due to autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma by pancreatic enzymes 1, Premature activation oftrypsin leads to activation of other pancreatic

1. Premature activation of trypsin leads to activation of other pancreatic enzymes. C. Results in liquefactive hemorrhagic necrosis of the pancreas and fat necrosis of the

peripancreatic fat (Fig. 11.1)

D. Most commonly due to alcohol and gallstones; other causes include trauma, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, drugs, scorpion stings, mumps, and rupture of a posterior duodenal ulcer.

E. Clinical features

1. Epigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back 2. Nausea and vomiting 3. Periumbilical and flank hemorrhage (necrosis spreads into the periumbilical soft

tissue and retroperitoneum)

4. Elevated serum lipase and amylase; lipase is more specific for pancreatic damage. 5. Hypocalcemia (calcium is consumed during saponification in fat necrosis)

5. Hypocalcemia (calcium is consumed during saponification in fat necrosis) Complications

3. Pancreatic abscess - often due to E coli; presents with abdominal pain, high fever, and persistently elevated amylase

4. DIC and ARDS

III. CHRONIC PANCREATITIS

A. Fibrosis of pancreatic parenchyma, most often secondary to recurrent acute

pancreatitis 1. Most commonly due to alcohol (adults) and cystic fibrosis (children); however,

many cases are idiopathic.

B. Clinical features

1. Epigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back 2. Pancreatic insufficiency-results in malabsorption with steatorrhea and fat-

soluble vitamin deficiencies. Amylase and lipase are not useful serologic markers of chronic pancreatitis.

3. Dystrophic calcification of pancreatic parenchyma on imaging; contrast studies reveal a 'chain of lakes' pattern due to dilatation of pancreatic ducts.

6. Serum tumor marker is CA 19-9.

D. Surgical resection involves en bloc removal of the head and neck of pancreas, proximal duodenum, and gallbladder (Whipple procedure).

E. Very poor prognosis; 1-year survival is < 10%.

COMMENTS

Hepatitis A Hepatitis E

(HAV) (HEV)

and

Fecal-oral transmission HAV is commonly acquired by travelers. HEV is commonly acquired from contaminated water or undercooked seafood.

Acute hepatitis; no chronic state. Anti-virus IgM marks active infection. Anti- virus IgG is protective, and its presence indicates prior infection or immunization (immunization is available for HAV). HEV infection in pregnant women is associated with fulminant hepatitis (liver failure with massive liver necrosis).

Hepatitis B

(HBV)

Parenteral transmission (e.g., childbirth, unprotected intercourse, intravenous drug abuse [IVDA], and needle stick)

Results in acute hepatitis; chronic disease occurs in 20% of cases (Table 11.3).

Hepatitis

C

(HCV)

Parenteral transmission (e.g., IVDA, unprotected intercourse); risk from transfusion is almost nonexistent due to screening of the blood supply.

Results in acute hepatitis; chronic disease occurs in most cases. HCV-RNA test confirms infection; decreased RNA levels indicate recovery; persistence indicates chronic disease.

Hepatitis D (HDV)

Dependent on HBV for infection; superinfection upon existing HBV is more severe than coinfection (infection with HBV and HDV at the same time)

Kidney and Urinary Tract Pathology

CONGENITAL

I. HORSESHOE KIDNEY

A. Conjoined kidneys usually connected at the lower pole (Fig. 12.1); most common congenital renal anomaly

B. Kidney is abnormally located in the lower abdomen; horseshoe kidney gets caught on the inferior mesenteric artery root during its ascent from the pelvis to the abdomen.

II. RENAL AGENESIS

A. Absent kidney formation; may be unilateral or bilateral B. Unilateral agenesis leads to hypertrophy of the existing kidney; hyperfiltration

increases risk of renal failure later in life.

C. Bilateral agenesis leads to oligohydramnios with lung hypoplasia, flat face with low set ears, and developmental defects of the extremities (Potter sequence, Fig. 12.2); incompatible with life

III. DYSPLASTIC KIDNEY

A. Noninherited, congenital malformation of the renal parenchyma characterized by cysts and abnormal tissue (e.g., cartilage, Fig. 12.3)

B. Usually unilateral; when bilateral, must be distinguished from inherited polycystic kidney disease

IV. POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (PKD)

A. Inherited defect leading to bilateral enlarged kidneys with cysts in the renal cortex and medulla (Fig. 12.4)

B. Autosomal recessive form presents in infants as worsening renal failure and

hypertension; newborns may present with Potter sequence. 1. Associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis (leads to portal hypertension) and

hepatic cysts

C. Autosomal dominant form presents in young adults as hypertension (due to

increased renin), hematuria, and worsening renal failure. 1. Due to mutation in the APKD1 or APKD2 gene; cysts develop over time. 2. Associated with berry aneurysm, hepatic cysts, and mitral valve prolapse

V. MEDULLARY CYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE

A. Inherited (autosomal dominant) defect leading to cysts in the medullary collecting

ducts

B. Parenchymal fibrosis results in shrunken kidneys and worsening renal failure.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (ARF)

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Acute, severe decrease in renal function (develops within days) B. Hallmark is azotemia (increased BUN and creatinine [Cr]), often with oliguria.
======================================
pathoma.com

125

126

126

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

C. Divided into prerenal, postrenal, and intrarenal azotemia based on etiology

II. PRERENAL AZOTEMIA

A. Due to decreased blood flow to kidneys (e.g., cardiac failure); common cause of ARF B. Decreased blood flow results in ↓ GFR, azotemia, and oliguria. C. Reabsorption of fluid and BUN ensues (serum BUN:Cr ratio > 15); tubular function remains intact (fractional excretion of sodium [FEN a] < 1% and urine osmolality [osm] > 500 mOsm/kg).

III. POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA

A. Due to obstruction of urinary tract downstream from the kidney (e.g., ureters) B. Decreased outflow results in ↓GFR, azotemia, and oliguria. C. During early stage of obstruction, increased tubular pressure "forces" BUN into the blood (serum BUN:Cr ratio> 15); tubular function remains intact (FENa < 1% and urine osm > 500 mOsm/kg).

D. With long-standing obstruction, tubular damage ensues, resulting in decreased reabsorption of BUN (serum BUN:Cr ratio< 15), decreased reabsorption of sodium (FEN a > 2%), and inability to concentrate urine (urine osm < 500 mOsm/kg).

IV. ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS

A. Injury and necrosis of tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 12.5); most common cause of acute renal failure (intrarenal azotemia)

B. Necrotic cells plug tubules; obstruction decreases GFR. 1. Brown, granular casts are seen in the urine.

C. Dysfunctional tubular epithelium results in decreased reabsorption of BUN (serum BUN:Cr ratio < 15), decreased reabsorption of sodium (FENa > 2%), and inability to concentrate urine (urine osm < 500 mOsm/kg).

D. Etiology may be ischemic or nephrotoxic.

1. Ischemia - Decreased blood supply results in necrosis of tubules.

i. Often preceded by prerenal azotemia ii. Proximal tubule and medullary segment of the thick ascending limb are

particularly susceptible to ischemic damage.

2. Nephrotoxic - Toxic agents result in necrosis of tubules.

i. Proximal tubule is particularly susceptible. ii. Causes include aminoglycosides (most common), heavy metals (e.g., lead),

myoglobinuria (e.g., from crush injury to muscle), ethylene glycol (associated with oxalate crystals in urine), radiocontrast dye, and urate (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome).

iii. Hydration and allopurinol are used prior to initiation of chemotherapy to decrease risk of urate-induced ATN.

A. Interstitial fibrosis and atrophy of tubules due to multiple bouts of acute pyelonephritis

B. Due to vesicoureteral reflux (children) or obstruction (e.g., BPH or cervical carcinoma)

C. Leads to cortical scarring with blunted calyces; scarring at upper and lower poles is characteristic of vesicoureteral reflux.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

B. Presents with classic triad of hematuria, palpable mass, and flank pain

1. All three symptoms rarely occur together; hematuria is the most common symptom.

2. Fever, weight loss, or paraneoplastic syndrome (e.g., EPO, renin, PTHrP, or ACTH) may also be present.

3. Rarely may present with left-sided varicocele

Involvement of the left renal vein by carcinoma blocks drainage of the left spermatic vein leading to varicocele.

ii. Right spermatic vein drains directly into the IVC; hence, right-sided varicocele is not seen.

C. Gross exam reveals a yellow mass (Fig. 12.19A); microscopically, the most common variant exhibits clear cytoplasm (clear cell type, Fig. 12.19B).

D. Pathogenesis involves loss of VHL (3p) tumor suppressor gene, which leads to increased IGF-1 (promotes growth) and increased HIF transcription factor (increases VEGF and PDGF).

E. Tumors may be hereditary or sporadic.

1. Sporadic tumors classically arise in adult males (average age is 60 years) as a single tumor in the upper pole of the kidney; major risk factor for sporadic tumors is cigarette smoke.

2. Hereditary tumors arise in younger adults and are often bilateral.

i. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with inactivation of the VHL gene leading to increased risk for hemangioblastoma of the cerebellum and renal cell carcinoma.

F. Staging

C. Most cases (90%) are sporadic; syndromic tumors may be seen with

1. WAGR syndrome - Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genital abnormalities, and mental and motor Retardation; associated with deletion of WT1 tumor suppressor gene (located at 11p13)

2. Denys-Drash syndrome - Wilms tumor, progressive renal (glomerular) disease, and male pseudohermaphroditism; associated with mutations of WT1

LOWER URINARY TRACT CARCINOMA

I. UROTHELIAL (TRANSITIONAL CELL) CARCINOMA

A. Malignant tumor arising from the urothelial lining of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder,

or urethra 1. Most common type of lower urinary tract cancer; usually arises in the bladder B. Major risk factor is cigarette smoke; additional risk factors are naphthylamine, azo

dyes, and long-term cyclophosphamide or phenacetin use.

C. Generally seen in older adults; classically presents with painless hematuria D. Arises via two distinct pathways (Fig. 12.21)

1. Flat - develops as a high-grade flat tumor and then invades; associated with early p53 mutations

2. Papillary - develops as a low-grade papillary tumor that progresses to a high- grade papillary tumor and then invades; not associated with early p53 mutations

E. Tumors are often multifocal and recur ("field defect").

IL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of squamous cells, usually involving the bladder B. Arises in a background of squamous metaplasia (normal bladder surface is not lined

B. Lined by squamous epithelium

II. BARTHOLIN CYST

A. Cystic dilation of the Bartholin gland

1. One Bartholin gland is present on each side of the vaginal canal and produces mucus-like fluid that drains via ducts into the lower vestibule.

B. Arises due to inflammation and obstruction of gland 1. Usually occurs in women of reproductive age

C. Presents as a unilateral, painful cystic lesion at the lower vestibule adjacent to the vaginal canal

III. CONDYLOMA

A. Warty neoplasm of vulvar skin, often large B. Most commonly due to HPV types 6 or 11 (condyloma acuminatum, Fig.13.1A); secondary syphilis (condyloma latum) is a less common cause. Both are sexually transmitted.

C. Histologically, HPV-associated condylomas are characterized by koilocytes (hallmark of HPV-infected cells, Fig. 13.1B).

D. Condylomas rarely progress to carcinoma (6 and 11 are low-risk HPV types).

IV. LICHEN SCLEROSIS

138

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Risk factors are related to HPV exposure and include multiple partners and early first age of intercourse; generally occurs in women of reproductive age 2. Arises from vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a dysplastic precursor lesion characterized by koilocytic change, disordered cellular maturation, nuclear atypia, and increased mitotic activity

F. Non-HPV related vulvar carcinoma arises, most often, from long-standing lichen

sclerosis. 1. Chronic inflammation and irritation eventually lead to carcinoma. 2. Generally seen in elderly women (average age is > 70 years)

VII. EXTRAMAMMARY PAGET DISEASE

A. Characterized by malignant epithelial cells in the epidermis of the vulva (Fig. 13.2A) B. Presents as erythematous, pruritic, ulcerated vulvar skin C. Represents carcinoma in situ, usually with no underlying carcinoma

1. Paget disease of the nipple is also characterized by malignant epithelial cells in the epidermis of the nipple, but it is almost always associated with an underlying carcinoma.

D. Must be distinguished from melanoma, which rarely can occur on the vulva

1. Paget cells are PAS +, keratin+, and S-100-. 2. Melanoma is PAS-, keratin-, and S-100 +.
======================================
VAGINA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Canal leading to the cervix B. Mucosa is lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium

II. ADENOSIS

A. · Focal persistence of columnar epithelium in the upper vagina (Fig. 13.2B)

1. During development, squamous epithelium from the lower 1/3 of the vagina (derived from the urogenital sinus) grows upward to replace the columnar epithelium lining of the upper 2/3 of the vagina (derived from the Müllerian ducts).

B. Increased incidence in females who were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero

III. CLEAR CELL ADENOCARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of glands with clear cytoplasm B. Rare, but feared, complication of DES-associated vaginal adenosis

Female Genital System and Gestational Pathology

C. Discovery of this complication (along with other DES-induced abnormalities of the gynecologic tract such as abnormal shape of the uterus) led to cessation of DES usage.

IV. EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA

A. Malignant mesenchymal proliferation of immature skeletal muscle; rare B. Presents as bleeding and a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina or penis of a

child (usually< 5 yrs of age); also known as sarcoma botryoides (Fig. 13.3)

C. Rhabdomyoblast, the characteristic cell, exhibits cytoplasmic cross-striations and positive immunohistochemical staining for desmin and myogenin.

V. VAGINAL CARCINOMA

A. Carcinoma arising from squamous epithelium lining the vaginal mucosa B. Usually related to high-risk HPV C. Precursor lesion is vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). D. When spread to regional lymph nodes occurs, cancer from the lower 1/3 of vagina goes to inguinal nodes, and cancer from the upper 2/3 goes to regional iliac nodes.

CERVIX

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anatomically, comprises the "neck" of the uterus B. Divided into the exocervix (visible on vaginal exam) and endocervix 1. Exocervix is lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium. 2. Endocervix is lined by a single layer of columnar cells. 3.

Junction between the exocervix and endocervix is called the transformation zone (Fig. 13.4A).
======================================
II. HPV

A. Sexually transmitted DNA virus that infects the lower genital tract, especially the cervix in the transformation zone

B. Infection is usually eradicated by acute inflammation; persistent infection leads to an

increased risk for cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN). C. Risk of CIN depends on HPV type, which is determined by DNA sequencing.

1. High-risk - HPV types 16, 18, 31, and 33 2. Low-risk - HPV types 6 and 11

D. High-risk HPV produce E6 and E7 proteins which result in increased destruction of p53 and Rb, respectively. Loss of these tumor suppressor proteins increases the risk for CIN.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

III. CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA

A. Characterized by koilocytic change, disordered cellular maturation, nuclear atypia, and increased mitotic activity within the cervical epithelium.

B. Divided into grades based on the extent of epithelial involvement by immature dysplastic cells

1. CIN I involves < 1/3 of the thickness of the epithelium. 2. CIN II involves < 2/3 of the thickness of the epithelium. 3. CIN III involves slightly less than the entire thickness of the epithelium (Fig.

13.4B).

4. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) involves the entire thickness of the epithelium.

C. CIN classically progresses in a stepwise fashion through CIN I, CIN II, CIN III, and CIS to become invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

1. Progression is not inevitable (e.g., CIN I often regresses). 2. The higher the grade of dysplasia, the more likely it is to progress to carcinoma

and the less likely it is to regress to normal.

IV. CERVICAL CARCINOMA

A. Invasive carcinoma that arises from the cervical epithelium B. Most commonly seen in middle-aged women (average age is 40-50 years) C. Presents as vaginal bleeding, especially postcoital bleeding, or cervical discharge D. Key risk factor is high-risk HPV infection; secondary risk factors include smoking and immunodeficiency (e.g., cervical carcinoma is an AIDS-defining illness).

E. Most common subtypes of cervical carcinoma are squamous cell carcinoma (80% of cases) and adenocarcinoma (15% of cases). Both types are related to HPV infection. F. Advanced tumors often invade through the anterior uterine wall into the bladder, blocking the ureters. Hydronephrosis with postrenal failure is a common cause of death in advanced cervical carcinoma.
======================================
V. SCREENING AND PREVENTION OF CERVICAL CARCINOMA

A. The goal of screening is to catch dysplasia (CIN) before it develops into carcinoma.

1. Progression from CIN to carcinoma, on average, takes 10-20 years. 2. Screening begins at age 21 and is initially performed every three years.

B. Pap smear is the gold standard for screening.

1. Cells are scraped from the transformation zone using a brush and analyzed under a microscope.

2. Dysplastic cells are classified as low grade (CINI) or high grade (CIN II and III). 3. High-grade dysplasia is characterized by cells with hyperchromatic (dark) nuclei

and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios (Fig. 13.4C).

C. Pap smear is the most successful screening test developed to date.

Female Genital System and Gestational Pathology

1. It is responsible for a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality of cervical carcinoma (cervical carcinoma went from being the most common to one of the least common types of gynecologic carcinoma in the US).

2. Women who develop invasive cervical carcinoma usually have not undergone screening.

D. An abnormal Pap smear is followed by confirmatory colposcopy (visualization of cervix with a magnifying glass) and biopsy.

E. Limitations of the Pap smear include inadequate sampling of the transformation

zone (false negative screening) and limited efficacy in screening for adenocarcinoma. 1. Despite Pap smear screening, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has not decreased

significantly.

F. Immunization is effective in preventing HPV infections.

1. The quadrivalent vaccine covers HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. 2. Antibodies generated against types 6 and 11 protect against condylomas. 3. Antibodies generated against types 16 and 18 protect against CIN and carcinoma. 4. Pap smears are still necessary due to the limited number of HPV types covered

by the vaccine.

C. Presents as fever, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic pain

V. CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS

A. Chronic inflammation of the endometrium B. Characterized by lymphocytes and plasma cells

1. Plasma cells are necessary for the diagnosis of chronic endometritis given that lymphocytes are normally found in the endometrium.

C. Causes include retained products of conception, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (e.g., Chlamydia), IUD, and TB.

D. Presents as abnormal uterine bleeding, pain, and infertility

VI. ENDOMETRIAL POLYP

A. Hyperplastic protrusion of endometrium (Fig. 13.6) B. Presents as abnormal uterine bleeding C. Can arise as a side effect of tamoxifen, which has anti-estrogenic effects on the breast

but weak pro-estrogenic effects on the endometrium
======================================
VII. ENDOMETRIOSIS

A. Endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine endometrial lining

1. Most likely due to retrograde menstruation with implantation at an ectopic site

B. Presents as dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and pelvic pain; may cause

infertility 1. Endometriosis cycles just like normal endometrium.

C. Most common site of involvement is the ovary, which classically results in formation

of a 'chocolate' cyst (Fig. 13.7A). 1. Other sites of involvement include the uterine ligaments (pelvic pain), pouch of Douglas (pain with defecation), bladder wall (pain with urination), bowel serosa (abdominal pain and adhesions), and fallopian tube mucosa (scarring increases risk for ectopic tubal pregnancy); implants classically appear as yellow-brown 'gun-powder' nodules (Fig. 13.7B).

2. Involvement of the uterine myometrium is called adenomyosis.

D. There is an increased risk of carcinoma at the site of endometriosis, especially in the ovary.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

XI. LEIOMYOSARCOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of smooth muscle arising from the myometrium B. Arises de novo; leiomyosarcomas do not arise from leiomyomas. C. Usually seen in postmenopausal women D. Gross exam often shows a single lesion with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage; histological features include necrosis, mitotic activity, and cellular atypia.
======================================
OVARY

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. The functional unit of the ovary is the follicle. B. A follicle consists of an oocyte surrounded by granulosa and theca cells (Fig. 13.11A)

B. A follicle consists of an oocyte surrounded by granulosa and theca cells (Fig. 13.11A) 1 LH acts on theca cells to induce androgen production.

1. LH acts on theca cells to induce androgen production. 2. FSH stimulates granulosa cells to convert androgen to estradiol (drives the

proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle).

3. Estradiol surge induces an LH surge, which leads to ovulation (marking the beginning of the secretory phase of the endometrial cycle).

C. After ovulation, the residual follicle becomes a corpus luteum (Fig. 13.11B), which primarily secretes progesterone (drives the secretory phase which prepares the endometrium for a possible pregnancy).

1. Hemorrhage into a corpus luteum can result in a hemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst, especially during early pregnancy.

D. Degeneration of follicles results in follicular cysts. Small numbers of follicular cysts are common in women and have no clinical significance.

II. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN DISEASE (PCOD)

A. Multiple ovarian follicular cysts due to hormone imbalance 1. Affects roughly 5% of women of reproductive age B. Characterized by increased LH and low FSH (LH:FSH > 2)

1. Increased LH induces excess androgen production (from theca cells) resulting in hirsutism (excess hair in a male distribution).

2. Androgen is converted to estrone in adipose tissue.

i. Estrone feedback decreases FSH resulting in cystic degeneration of follicles. ii. High levels of circulating estrone increase risk for endometrial carcinoma.

C. Classic presentation is an obese young woman with infertility, oligomenorrhea, and hirsutism; some patients have insulin resistance and may develop type 2 diabetes mellitus 10-15 years later.

======================================
OVARIAN TUMORS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Ovary is composed of three cell types: surface epithelium, germ cells, and sex cord- stroma.

B. Tumor can arise from any of these cell types or from metastases.

II. SURFACE EPITHELIAL TUMORS

A. Most common type of ovarian tumor (70% of cases) B. Derived from coelomic epithelium that lines the ovary; coelomic epithelium

embryologically produces the epithelial lining of the fallopian tube (serous cells), endometrium, and endocervix (mucinous cells).

C. The two most common subtypes of surface epithelial tumors are serous and

mucinous; both are usually cystic. 1. Serous tumors are full of watery fluid. 2. Mucinous tumors are full of mucus-like fluid.

D. Mucinous and serous tumors can be benign, borderline, or malignant.

1. Benign tumors (cystadenomas) are composed of a single cyst with a simple, flat lining (Fig. 13.12); most commonly arise in premenopausal women (30-40 years old)

2. Malignant tumors (cystadenocarcinomas) are composed of complex cysts with a thick, shaggy lining; most commonly arise in postmenopausal women (60-70 years old)

3. Borderline tumors have features in between benign and malignant tumors.

i. Better prognosis than clearly malignant tumors, but still carry metastatic

potential

4. BRCA1 mutation carriers have an increased risk for serous carcinoma of the

ovary and fallopian tube. i. BRCA1 carriers often elect to have a prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy (along with prophylactic mastectomy due to the increased risk for breast cancer).

E. Less common subtypes of surface epithelial tumors include endometrioid and

Brenner tumor. 1. Endometrioid tumors are composed of endometrial-like glands and are usually

1. Endometrioid tumors are composed of endometrial-like glands and are usually malignant.

malignant. i. May arise from endometriosis ii.

15% of endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary are associated with an independent endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid type).

2. Brenner tumors are composed of bladder-like epithelium and are usually benign.

F. Surface tumors clinically present late with vague abdominal symptoms (pain and fullness) or signs of compression (urinary frequency).

Fig.13.12 Ovarian cystadenoma.

145

146

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Prognosis is generally poor for surface epithelial carcinoma (worst prognosis of female genital tract cancers).

2. Epithelial carcinomas tend to spread locally, especially to the peritoneum. . CA-125 is a useful serum marker to monitor treatment response and screen for

recurrence.
======================================
G

III. GERM CELL TUMORS

A. 2nd most common type of ovarian tumor (15% of cases) B. Usually occur in women of reproductive age C. Tumor subtypes mimic tissues normally produced by germ cells. 1. Fetal tissue - cystic teratoma and embryonal carcinoma 2. Oocytes - dysgerminoma 3. Yolk sac - endodermal sinus tumor 4. Placental tissue - choriocarcinoma

D. Cystic teratoma

1. Cystic tumor composed of fetal tissue derived from two or three embryologic

layers (e.g., skin, hair, bone, cartilage, gut, and thyroid, Fig. 13.13) i. Most common germ cell tumor in females; bilateral in 10% of cases

2. Benign, but presence of immature tissue (usually neural) or somatic malignancy (usually squamous cell carcinoma of skin) indicates malignant potential.

3. Struma ovarii is a teratoma composed primarily of thyroid tissue.

E. Dysgerminoma

1. Tumor composed of large cells with clear cytoplasm and central nuclei (resemble oocytes, Fig. 13.14); most common malignant germ cell tumor

2. Testicular counterpart is called seminoma, which is a relatively common germ cell tumor in males.

3. Good prognosis; responds to radiotherapy 4. Serum LDH may be elevated.

F. Endodermal sinus tumor

1. Malignant tumor that mimics the yolk sac; most common germ cell tumor in children

2. Serum AFP is often elevated. 3. Schiller-Duval bodies (glomerulus-like structures) are classically seen on

histology (Fig. 13.15).

G. Choriocarcinoma

1. Malignant tumor composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts; mimics placental tissue, but villi are absent

2. Small, hemorrhagic tumor with early hematogenous spread 3. High β- hCG is characteristic (produced by syncytiotrophoblasts); may lead to

thecal cysts in the ovary

Female Genital System and Gestational Pathology

4. Poor response to chemotherapy

H. Embryonal carcinoma

1. Malignant tumor composed of large primitive cells 2. Aggressive with early metastasis
======================================
IV. SEX CORD-STROMAL TUMORS

A. Tumors that resemble sex cord-stromal tissues of the ovary B. Granulosa-theca cell tumor

1. Neoplastic proliferation of granulosa and theca cells 2. Often produces estrogen; presents with signs of estrogen excess

i. Prior to puberty - precocious puberty ii. Reproductive age - menorrhagia or metrorrhagia iii. Postmenopause (most common setting for granulosa-theca cell tumors) -

endometrial hyperplasia with postmenopausal uterine bleeding

3. Malignant, but minimal risk for metastasis

C. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor

1. Composed of Sertoli cells that form tubules and Leydig cells (between tubules) with characteristic Reinke crystals

2. May produce androgen; associated with hirsutism and virilization

D. Fibroma

1. Benign tumor of fibroblasts (Fig. 13.16) 2. Associated with pleural effusions and ascites (Meigs syndrome); syndrome

resolves with removal of tumor.

V. METASTASIS

A. Krukenberg tumor is a metastatic mucinous tumor that involves both ovaries; most

commonly due to metastatic gastric carcinoma (diffuse type) 1. Bilaterality helps distinguish metastases from primary mucinous carcinoma of

the ovary, which is usually unilateral.

B. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is massive amounts of mucus in the peritoneum.

1. Due to a mucinous tumor of the appendix, usually with metastasis to the ovary

GESTATIONAL PATHOLOGY

I. ECTOPIC PREGNANCY

A. Implantation of fertilized ovum at a site other than the uterine wall; most common site is the lumen of the fallopian tube (Fig. 13.17).

B. Key risk factor is scarring (e.g., secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis).

Fig.13.16 Ovarian fibroma.

Fig. 13.17 Ectopic tubal pregnancy. (Courtesy of humpath.com)

147

148

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

C. Classic presentation is lower quadrant abdominal pain a few weeks after a missed

period. 1. Surgical emergency; major complications are bleeding into fallopian tube

(hematosalpinx) and rupture.

II. SPONTANEOUS ABORTION

A. Miscarriage of fetus occurring before 20 weeks gestation (usually during first
======================================
trimester) 1. Common; occurs in up to 1/4 of recognizable pregnancies

B. Presents as vaginal bleeding, cramp-like pain, and passage of fetal tissues C. Most often due to chromosomal anomalies (especially trisomy 16); other causes include hypercoagulable states (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome), congenital infection, and exposure to teratogens (especially during the first 2 weeks of embryogenesis). 1. Effect of teratogens generally depends on the dose, agent, and time of exposure

1. Effect ofteratogens generally depends on the dose, agent, and time of exposure (Table 12.1).

(Table 12.1). i. First two weeks of gestation - spontaneous abortion ii. Weeks 3-8 - risk of organ malformation iii. Months 3-9 - risk of organ hypoplasia

III. PLACENTA PREVIA

A. Implantation of the placenta in the lower uterine segment; placenta overlies cervical os (opening).

B. Presents as third-trimester bleeding C. Often requires delivery of fetus by caesarian section

IV. PLACENTAL ABRUPTION

A. Separation of placenta from the decidua prior to delivery of the fetus (Fig. 13.18) B. Common cause of still birth C. Presents with third-trimester bleeding and fetal insufficiency

V. PLACENTA ACCRETA

A. Improper implantation of placenta into the myometrium with little or no intervening decidua

B. Presents with difficult delivery of the placenta and postpartum bleeding

Table 12.1: Common Teratogens and Associated Effects
======================================
Female Genital System and Gestational Pathology

C. Often requires hysterectomy

VI. PREECLAMPSIA

A. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, proteinuria, and edema, usually arising in the

third trimester; seen in approximately 5% of pregnancies 1. Hypertension may be severe, leading to headaches and visual abnormalities. B. Due to abnormality of the maternal-fetal vascular interface in the placenta; resolves

with delivery

C. Eclampsia is preeclampsia with seizures. D. HELLP is preeclampsia with thrombotic microangiopathy involving the liver;

characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets

E. Both eclampsia and HELLP usually warrant immediate delivery.

VII. SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME

A. Death of a healthy infant (1 month to 1 year old) without obvious cause B. Infants usually expire during sleep C. Risk factors include sleeping on stomach, exposure to cigarette smoke, and

prematurity.

VIII. HYDATIDIFORM MOLE

A. Abnormal conception characterized by swollen and edematous villi with proliferation of trophoblasts

through the vaginal canal (Fig. 13.19A). 1. With prenatal care, moles are diagnosed by routine ultrasound in the early

first trimester. Fetal heart sounds are absent, and a 'snowstorm' appearance is classically seen on ultrasound.

D. Classified as complete or partial (Table 12.2) E. Treatment is suction curettage.

1. Subsequent b -hCG monitoring is important to ensure adequate mole

removal and to screen for the development of choriocarcinoma. i. Choriocarcinoma may arise as a complication of gestation (spontaneous abortion, normal pregnancy, or hydatidiform mole) or as a spontaneous germ cell tumor.

ii. Choriocarcinomas that arise from the gestational pathway respond well to chemotherapy; those that arise from the germ cell pathway do not.

ii. Does not progress to invasive carcinoma

TESTICLE

I. CRYPTORCHIDISM

A. Failure of testicle to descend into the scrotal sac

1. Testicles normally develop in the abdomen and then "descend" into the scrotal

sac as the fetus grows.

B. Most common congenital male reproductive abnormality; seen in 1 % of male infants

pathoma.com

151

152

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

C. Most cases resolve spontaneously; otherwise, orchiopexy is performed before 2 years of age.

D. Complications include testicular atrophy with infertility and increased risk for seminoma.

II. ORCHITIS

A. Inflammation of the testicle B. Causes

1. Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D-K) or Neisseria gonorrhoeae - Seen in young adults. Increased risk of sterility, but libido is not affected because Leydig cells are spared.

2. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas - Seen in older adults; urinary tract infection pathogens spread into the reproductive tract.

3. Mumps virus (teenage males) - increased risk for infertility; testicular inflammation is usually not seen in children < 10 years old.

4. Autoimmune orchitis - characterized by granulomas involving the seminiferous tubules
======================================
III. TESTICULAR TORSION

A. Twisting of the spermatic cord; thin-walled veins become obstructed leading to congestion and hemorrhagic infarction (Fig. 14.2).

B. Usually due to congenital failure of testes to attach to the inner lining of the scrotum (via the processus vaginalis)

C. Presents in adolescents with sudden testicular pain and absent cremasteric reflex

IV. VARICOCELE

A. Dilation of the spermatic vein due to impaired drainage B. Presents as scrotal swelling with a "bag of worms" appearance C. Usually left sided; left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein, while the right

II. GERM CELL TUMORS

A. Most common type of testicular tumor (> 95% of cases) B. Usually occur between 15-40 years of age C. Risk factors include cryptorchidism and Klinefelter syndrome. D. Divided into seminoma and nonseminoma

1. Seminomas (55% of cases) are highly responsive to radiotherapy, metastasize late, and have an excellent prognosis.

2. Nonseminomas (45% of cases) show variable response to treatment and often metastasize early.

E. Seminoma is a malignant tumor comprised of large cells with clear cytoplasm and

central nuclei (resemble spermatogonia, Fig. 14.4A); forms a homogeneous mass with no hemorrhage or necrosis (Fig. 14.4B) 1. Most common testicular tumor; resembles ovarian dysgerminoma 2. Rare cases may produce β- hCG. 3. Good prognosis; responds to radiotherapy

PROSTATE

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Small, round organ that lies at the base of the bladder encircling the urethra B. Sits anterior to the rectum; posterior aspect of prostate is palpable by digital rectal

exam (DRE).

C. Consists of glands and stroma (Fig. 14.9)

1. Glands are composed of an inner layer of luminal cells and an outer layer of basal cells; secrete alkaline, milky fluid that is added to sperm and seminal vesicle fluid to make semen.

2. Glands and stroma are maintained by androgens.

II. ACUTE PROSTATITIS

A. Acute inflammation of the prostate; usually due to bacteria

1. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes in young

adults.

2. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas are common causes in older adults.

B. Presents as dysuria with fever and chills C. Prostate is tender and boggy on digital rectal exam. D. Prostatic secretions show WBCs; culture reveals bacteria.
======================================
III. CHRONIC PROSTATITIS

A. Chronic inflammation of prostate B. Presents as dysuria with pelvic or low back pain C. Prostatic secretions show WBCs, but cultures are negative.

IV. BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA (BPH) A. Hyperplasia of prostatic stroma and glands B. Age-related change (present in most men by the age of 60 years); no increased risk

for cancer

C. Related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)

1. Testosterone is converted to DHT by 5α -reductase in stromal cells. 2. DHT acts on the androgen receptor of stromal and epithelial cells resulting in

hyperplastic nodules.

D. Occurs in the central periurethral zone of the prostate E. Clinical features include

1. Problems starting and stopping urine stream 2. Impaired bladder emptying with increased risk for infection and hydronephrosis

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

ii. Presents as poor lactation, loss of pubic hair, and fatigue

3. Empty sella syndrome-congenital defect of the sella

i. Herniation of the arachnoid and CSF into the sella compresses and destroys the pituitary gland.

ii. Pituitary gland is "absent" (empty sella) on imaging.

POSTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin are made in the hypothalamus and then

transported via axons to the posterior pituitary for release. 1. ADH acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney to promote free

water retention.

2. Oxytocin mediates uterine contraction during labor and release of breast milk (let-down) in lactating mothers.

II. CENTRAL DIABETES INSIPIDUS

A. ADH deficiency B. Due to hypothalamic or posterior pituitary pathology (e.g., tumor, trauma, infection,

or inflammation)

C. Clinical features are based on loss of free water.

1. Polyuria and polydipsia with risk of life-threatening dehydration 2. Hypernatremia and high serum osmolality 3. Low urine osmolality and specific gravity

D. Water deprivation test fails to increase urine osmolality (useful for diagnosis). E. Treatment is desmopressin (ADH analog).

III. NEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS A. Impaired renal response to ADH B. Due to inherited mutations or drugs (e.g., lithium and demeclocycline) C. Clinical features are similar to central diabetes insipidus, but there is no response to

desmopressin.

IV. SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ADH (SIADH) SECRETION

A. Excessive ADH secretion B. Most often due to ectopic production (e.g., small cell carcinoma of the lung); other causes include CNS trauma, pulmonary infection, and drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide).

C. Clinical features are based on retention of free water.

1. Hyponatremia and low serum osmolality 2. Mental status changes and seizures - Hyponatremia leads to neuronal swelling

and cerebral edema.

D. Treatment is free water restriction or demeclocycline.

A. Cystic dilation of thyroglossal duct remnant

1. Thyroid develops at the base of tongue and then travels along the thyroglossal

duct to the anterior neck.

2. Thyroglossal duct normally involutes; a persistent duct, however, may undergo cystic dilation.

β1 -adrenergic receptors)

B. Clinical features include

1. Weight loss despite increased appetite 2. Heat intolerance and sweating 3. Tachycardia with increased cardiac output 4. Arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation), especially in the elderly 5. Tremor, anxiety, insomnia, and heightened emotions 6. Staring gaze with lid lag 7. Diarrhea with malabsorption 8. Oligomenorrhea 9. Bone resorption with hypercalcemia (risk for osteoporosis) 10. Decreased muscle mass with weakness 11. Hypocholesterolemia 12. Hyperglycemia (due to gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis)

IL GRAVES DISEASE

A. Autoantibody (IgG) that stimulates TSH receptor (type II hypersensitivity) B. Leads to increased synthesis and release of thyroid hormone

1. Most common cause of hyperthyroidism 2. Classically occurs in women of childbearing age (20-40 years)

C. Clinical features include 1. Hyperthyroidism 2. Diffuse goiter - Constant TSH stimulation leads to thyroid hyperplasia and

hypertrophy (Fig. 15.lA).

3. Exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema

i. Fibroblasts behind the orbit and overlying the shin express the TSH receptor. ii. TSH activation results in glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin sulfate and

hyaluronic acid) buildup, inflammation, fibrosis, and edema leading to exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema.

C. Chronic inflammation with germinal centers and Hurthle cells (eosinophilic metaplasia of cells that line follicles) is seen on histology (Fig. 15.3).

D. Increased risk for B-cell (marginal zone) lymphoma; presents as an enlarging thyroid gland late in disease course

II. SUBACUTE GRANULOMATOUS (DE QUERVAIN) THYROIDITIS

A. Granulomatous thyroiditis that follows a viral infection B. Presents as a tender thyroid with transient hyperthyroidism C. Self-limited; rarely (15% of cases) may progress to hypothyroidism

III. RIEDEL FIBROSING THYROIDITIS

A. Chronic inflammation with extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland B. Presents as hypothyroidism with a 'hard as wood,' nontender thyroid gland C. Fibrosis may extend to involve local structures (e.g., airway).

1. Clinically mimics anaplastic carcinoma, but patients are younger (40s), and malignant cells are absent

THYROID NEOPLASIA

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Usually presents as a distinct, solitary nodule

B.

1. Thyroid nodules are more likely to be benign than malignant. 131 I radioactive uptake studies are useful to further characterize nodules. Increased uptake ('hot' nodule) is seen in Graves disease or nodular 1. goiter.

2. Decreased uptake ('cold' nodule) is seen in adenoma and carcinoma; often warrants biopsy

C. Biopsy is performed by fine needle aspiration (FNA).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

B. Usually nonfunctional; less commonly, may secrete thyroid hormone

III. PAPILLARY CARCINOMA

A. Most common type of thyroid carcinoma (80% of cases) B. Exposure to ionizing radiation in childhood is a major risk factor. C. Comprised of papillae lined by cells with clear, 'Orphan Annie eye' nuclei and

nuclear grooves (Fig. 15.5A); papillae are often associated with psammoma bodies (Fig. 15.5B).

D. Often spreads to cervical (neck) lymph nodes, but prognosis is excellent (10-year survival> 95%)

IV. FOLLICULAR CARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of follicles surrounded by a fibrous capsule with invasion

through the capsule (Fig. 15.6) 1.

Invasion through the capsule helps distinguish follicular carcinoma from follicular adenoma.

2. Entire capsule must be examined microscopically. 3. FNA only examines cells and not the capsule; hence, a distinction between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma cannot be made by FNA.

B. Metastasis generally occurs hematogenously.

V. MEDULLARY CARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of parafollicular C cells; comprises 5% of thyroid

carcinomas 1. C cells are neuroendocrine cells that secrete calcitonin. 2. Calcitonin lowers serum calcium by increasing renal calcium excretion but is

inactive at normal physiologic levels.

3. High levels of calcitonin produced by tumor may lead to hypocalcemia. 4. Calcitonin often deposits within the tumor as amyloid.

B. Biopsy reveals sheets of malignant cells in an amyloid stroma (Fig. 15.7). C. Familial cases are often due to multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B,

which are associated with mutations in the RET oncogene. 1. MEN 2 results in medullary carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid

adenomas (2A) or ganglioneuromas of the oral mucosa (2B).

PARATHYROID GLANDS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Chief cells regulate serum free (ionized) calcium via parathyroid hormone (PTH)

secretion, which 1. 2.

Increases bone osteoclast activity, releasing calcium and phosphate Increases small bowel absorption of calcium and phosphate (indirectly by activating vitamin D) Increases renal calcium reabsorption (distal tubule) and decreases phosphate reabsorption (proximal tubule)

3

B. Increased serum ionized calcium levels provide negative feedback to decrease PTH secretion.

IL PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

A. Excess PTH due to a disorder of the parathyroid gland itself B. Most common cause is parathyroid adenoma (>80% of cases); sporadic parathyroid

hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma are less common causes.

C. Parathyroid adenoma is a benign neoplasm, usually involving one gland.

1. Most often results in asymptomatic hypercalcemia; however, may present with

consequences of increased PTH and hypercalcemia such as i. Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate stones) ii. Nephrocalcinosis - metastatic calcification of renal tubules (Fig. 15.9),

potentially leading to renal insufficiency and polyuria

iii. CNS disturbances (e.g., depression and seizures) iv. Constipation, peptic ulcer disease, and acute pancreatitis v. Osteitis fibrosa cystica - resorption of bone leading to fibrosis and cystic

spaces (Fig. 15.10)

2. Laboratory findings include↑s erum PTH,↑s erum calcium, ↓ s erum phosphate, ↑urinary cAMP, and↑serum alkaline phosphatase.

3. Treatment involves surgical removal of the affected gland.

III. SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

A. Excess production of PTH due to a disease process extrinsic to the parathyroid gland B. Most common cause is chronic renal failure.

1. Renal insufficiency leads to decreased phosphate excretion. 2. ↑ serum phosphate binds free calcium. 3. ↓ free calcium stimulates all four parathyroid glands. 4. ↑ PTH leads to bone resorption (contributing to renal osteodystrophy). 5. Lab findings include ↑ PTH, ↓s erum calcium, ↑s erum phosphate, and ↑

alkaline phosphatase.

IV. HYPOPARATHYROIDISM

A. Low PTH B. Causes include autoimmune damage to the parathyroids, surgical excision, and

DiGeorge syndrome

C. Presents with symptoms related to low serum calcium 1. Numbness and tingling (particularly circumoral) 2. Muscle spasms (tetany) - may be elicited with filling of a blood pressure cuff

(Trousseau sign) or tapping on the facial nerve (Chvostek sign)

D. Labs reveal ↓PTH levels and ↓ serum calcium. E. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to end-organ resistance to PTH.

1. Labs reveal hypocalcemia with↑PTH levels. 2. Autosomal dominant form is associated with short stature and short 4th and 5th

digits.

ENDOCRINE PANCREAS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Composed of clusters of cells termed islets of Langerhans (Fig. 15.11) B. A single islet consists of multiple cell types, each producing one type of hormone. C. Insulin is secreted by beta cells, which lie in the center of the islets.

1. Major anabolic hormone; upregulates insulin-dependent glucose transporter protein (GLUT4) on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (glucose uptake by GLUT4 decreases serum glucose)

2. Increased glucose uptake by tissues leads to increased glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, and lipogenesis.

D. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells; it opposes insulin in order to increase blood glucose levels (e.g., in states of fasting) via glycogenolysis and lipolysis.

II. TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS

A. Insulin deficiency leading to a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia B. Due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells by T lymphocytes

1. Characterized by inflammation of islets

1. Characterized by inflammation of islets 2. Associated with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4 3. Autoantibodies against insulin are often present (sign of damage) and may be

seen years before clinical disease develops.

C. Manifests in childhood with clinical features of insulin deficiency

1. High serum glucose - Lack of insulin leads to decreased glucose uptake by fat

and skeletal muscle.

Fig. 15.10 Osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Fig. 15.11 Islets of Langerhans.

Fig. 15.12 Amyloid in islets, type II DM.

Endocrine Pathology

2. Weight loss, low muscle mass, and polyphagia - Unopposed glucagon leads to gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and lipolysis, which further exacerbates hyperglycemia.

3. Polyuria, polydipsia, and glycosuria - Hyperglycemia exceeds renal ability to resorb glucose; excess filtered glucose leads to osmotic diuresis.

4. Treatment involves lifelong insulin.

D. Risk for diabetic ketoacidosis

1. Characterized by excessive serum ketones 2. Often arises with stress (e.g., infection); epinephrine stimulates glucagon

2 Often arises with stress (e.g., infection); epinephrine stimulates glucagon secretion increasing lipolysis (along with gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis). i Increased lipolysis leads to increased free fatty acids (FFAs).

secretion increasing lipolysis (along with gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis). Increased lipolysis leads to increased free fatty acids (FFAs). i. ii. Liver converts FFAs to ketone bodies (β- hydroxybutyric acid and

acetoacetic acid).

3. Results in hyperglycemia (> 300 mg/dL), anion gap metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia

4. Presents with Kussmaul respirations, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, and fruity smelling breath (due to acetone)

5. Treatment is fluids (corrects dehydration from polyuria), insulin, and replacement of electrolytes (e.g., potassium).
======================================
III. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS

A. End-organ insulin resistance leading to a metabolic disorder characterized by

hyperglycemia 1. Most common type of diabetes (90% of cases); affects 5-10% of the US population 2. Incidence is rising.

B. Arises in middle-aged, obese adults

1. Obesity leads to decreased numbers of insulin receptors. 2. Strong genetic predisposition exists.

C. Insulin levels are increased early in disease, but later, insulin deficiency develops due to beta cell exhaustion; histology reveals amyloid deposition in the islets (Fig. 15.12). D. Clinical features include polyuria, polydipsia, and hyperglycemia, but disease is often

clinically silent.

E. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucose levels (normal is 70-120 mg/dL).

1. Random glucose > 200 mg/dL 2. Fasting glucose> 126 mg/dL 3. Glucose tolerance test with a serum glucose level > 200 mg/dL two hours after

glucose loading

F. Treatment involves weight loss (diet and exercise) initially; may require drug therapy to counter insulin resistance (e.g., sulfonylureas or metformin) or exogenous insulin after exhaustion of beta cells

G. Risk for hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma

1. High glucose (> 500 mg/dL) leads to life-threatening diuresis with hypotension and coma.

2. Ketones are absent due to small amounts of circulating insulin.

IV. LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF DIABETES

A. Nonenzymatic glycosylation (NEG) of vascular basement membranes

1. NEG of large- and medium-sized vessels leads to atherosclerosis and its resultant

complications. i. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among diabetics. ii. Peripheral vascular disease in diabetics is the leading cause of nontraumatic

amputations.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

2. NEG of small vessels (arterioles) leads to hyaline arteriolosclerosis (Fig. 15.13A).

i. Involvement of renal arterioles leads to glomerulosclerosis, resulting in small, scarred kidneys with a granular surface (Fig. 15.13B).

ii. Preferential involvement of efferent arterioles leads to glomerular hyperfiltration injury with microalbuminuria that eventually progresses to nephrotic syndrome; characterized by Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules in glomeruli

3. NEG of hemoglobin produces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), a marker of glycemic control.
======================================
B. Osmotic damage

1. Glucose freely enters into Schwann cells (which myelinate peripheral nerves), pericytes of retinal blood vessels, and the lens.

2. Aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol, resulting in osmotic damage. 3. Leads to peripheral neuropathy, impotence, blindness, and cataracts; diabetes is

the leading cause of blindness in the developed world.

V. PANCREATIC ENDOCRINE NEOPLASMS

A. Tumors of islet cells; account for < 5% of pancreatic neoplasms.

1. Often a component of MEN 1 along with parathyroid hyperplasia and pituitary adenomas

B. Insulinomas present as episodic hypoglycemia with mental status changes that are relieved by administration of glucose.

1. Diagnosed by↓ s erum glucose levels (usually< 50 mg/dL), ↑insulin, and ↑ C-peptide

C. Gastrinomas present as treatment-resistant peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome); ulcers may be multiple and can extend into the jejunum.

D. Somatostatinomas present as achlorhydria (due to inhibition of gastrin) and cholelithiasis with steatorrhea (due to inhibition of cholecystokinin).

E. VIPomas secrete excessive vasoactive intestinal peptide leading to watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria.

ADRENAL CORTEX

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Composed of three layers; each secretes predominantly one class of hormones.

1. Glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone). 2. Fasciculata produces glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol). 3. Reticularis produces weak androgens (e.g., DHEA).

B. Cortical hormones are derived from cholesterol.

Fig.15.13 Complications of diabetes. A, Hyaline arteriolosclerosis. B, Glomerulosclerosis.

Endocrine Pathology

1. Sequential enzymatic modification produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens (Fig. 15.14).

2. Each layer secretes distinct hormones based on enzymes present in that layer.

II. HYPERALDOSTERONISM

A. Excess aldosterone B. Classically presents as HTN, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis

1. Aldosterone increases absorption of sodium and secretion of potassium and

hydrogen ions in the distal tubule and collecting duct. Increased sodium expands plasma volume leading to HTN.

2

C. Primary hyperaldosteronism is most commonly due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (60%, Fig. 15.15) or adrenal adenoma (40%, Conn syndrome, Fig. 15.16); adrenal carcinoma is rare. 1. CT is useful to determine pathology 2. Treatment for bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is mineralocorticoid receptor

antagonist (e.g., spironolactone or eplerenone); adenoma and carcinoma are surgically resected.

D. Secondary hyperaldosteronism arises with activation of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., renovascular hypertension or CHF).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

E. Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism are distinguished by plasma renin and edema

1. Primary is characterized by low renin and no edema (aldosterone escape). 2. Secondary is characterized by high renin; edema is often present.

F. Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA) leads to familial

hyperaldosteronism

1. Aberrant expression of aldosterone synthase in the fasciculata due to genetic mutation; autosomal dominant

2. Classically presents as child with HTN and hypokalemia; aldosterone is high and renin is low.

3. Responds to dexamethasone; confirmed with genetic testing

G. Liddle syndrome mimics hyperaldosteronism.

1. Decreased degradation of sodium channels in collecting tubules due to genetic mutation; autosomal dominant

2. Presents as child with HTN, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but with low

aldosterone and low renin 3. Diagnosed by genetic testing 4. Treatment is potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride or triamterene), which

block tubular sodium channels; spironolactone is not effective.

H. Syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (SAME) also mimics hyperaldosteronism.

1. 11β- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β- HSD2) deficiency allows cortisol to activate renal aldosterone receptors; autosomal recessive

2. Presents as child with HTN, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but with low aldosterone and low renin

3. Diagnosed by low urinary free cortisone and genetic testing 4. May also arise with licorice (glycyrrhetinic acid), which blocks 11β- HSD2

III. HYPERCORTISOLISM (CUSHING SYNDROME)

A. Excess cortisol B. Clinical features include

1. Muscle weakness with thin extremities - Cortisol breaks down muscle to produce amino acids for gluconeogenesis.

2. Moon fades, buffalo hump, and truncal obesity - High insulin (due to high glucose) increases storage of fat centrally.

3. Abdominal striae - Impaired collagen synthesis results in thinning of skin 4. HTN often with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis

i. High cortisol increases sensitivity of peripheral vessels to catecholamines. ii. At very high levels, cortisol cross-reacts with mineralocorticoid receptors

(aldosterone is not increased).

5. Osteoporosis 6. Immune suppression

C. Diagnosis is based on 24-hour urine cortisol level (increased), late night salivary cortisol level (increased), and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.

1. Low-dose dexamethasone suppresses cortisol in normal individuals but fails to suppress cortisol in all causes of Cushing syndrome.

D. Plasma ACTH distinguishes ACTH-dependent causes of Cushing syndrome from ACTH-independent causes (table 15.1).

1. If ACTH-independent, next step is CT to look for an adrenal lesion. 2. If ACTH-dependent, next step is high-dose dexamethasone test.

E. High-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH production by a pituitary adenoma (serum cortisol is lowered) but does not suppress ectopic ACTH production (serum cortisol remains high).

1. High ACTH (decreased negative feedback) leads to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. 2. Mineralocorticoids and androgens may be increased or decreased depending on

2 Mineralocorticoids and androgens may be increased or decreased depending on the enzyme defect.

the enzyme defect.

B. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause (90% of cases).

1. Aldosterone and cortisol are decreased; steroidogenesis is shunted towards

androgens.

2. Classic form presents in neonates as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia with life- threatening hypotension (salt-wasting type); females have clitoral enlargement (genital ambiguity).

3. Nonclassic form presents later in life with androgen excess leading to precocious puberty (males) or hirsutism with menstrual irregularities (females).

C. 11-hydroxylase deficiency also leads to androgen excess, but weak

mineralocorticoids (DOC) are increased. 1. Deoxycorticosterone (DOC) leads to HTN (sodium retention) with mild

hypokalemia; renin and aldosterone are low.

2. Clitoral enlargement is seen in females

D. 17-hydroxylase deficiency leads to decreased cortisol and androgens.

1. Weak mineralocorticoids (DOC) are increased leading to HTN with mild hypokalemia; renin and aldosterone are low.

2. Decreased androgens lead to primary amenorrhea and lack of pubic hair (females) or ambiguous genitalia with undescended testes (males).

F. Treatment for CAH is glucocorticoids; mineralocorticoids (21-hydroxylase deficiency) or sex steroids (17-hydroxylase deficiency) given as necessary.

V. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY

A. Deficiency of adrenal hormones B. Acute insufficiency presents as weakness and shock. Causes include

1. Abrupt withdrawal of glucocorticoids 2. Treatment of Cushing syndrome 3. Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome - hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands (Fig. 15.17), classically due to sepsis and DIC in young children with Neisseria meningitidis infection

C. Chronic insufficiency (Addison disease) presents with vague, progressive symptoms such as hypotension, weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

D. Addison disease most often arises with progressive adrenal damage.

1. Common causes include autoimmune destruction (most common cause in the West), TB (most common cause in the developing world), and metastatic carcinoma (e.g., from lung).

2. Autoimmune adrenalitis can be a component of autoimmune polyendocrine

1. Relative vitamin A deficiency results in squamous metaplasia of lactiferous

ducts, producing duct blockage and inflammation. C. Clinically presents as a subareolar mass with nipple retraction

III. MAMMARY DUCT ECTASIA

A. Inflammation with dilation (ectasia) of the subareolar ducts 1. Rare; classically arises in multiparous postmenopausal women

B. Presents as a periareolar mass with green-brown nipple discharge (inflammatory

debris) 1. Chronic inflammation with plasma cells is seen on biopsy.

IV. FAT NECROSIS

A. Necrosis of breast fat B. Usually related to trauma; however, a history of trauma may not always be evident. C. Presents as a mass on physical exam or abnormal calcification on mammography

(due to saponification)

D. Biopsy shows necrotic fat with associated calcifications and giant cells.

BENIGN TUMORS AND FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES

I. FIBROCYSTIC CHANGE

A. Development of fibrosis and cysts in the breast

1. Most common change in the premenopausal breast; thought to be hormone

mediated

Breast Pathology

1. Papillary carcinoma is characterized by fibrovascular projections lined by epithelial cells without underlying myoepithelial cells.

2. Risk of papillary carcinoma increases with age; thus, it is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women.

III. FIBROADENOMA

A. Tumor of fibrous tissue and glands (Fig. 16.3) B. Most common benign neoplasm of the breast; usually seen in premenopausal

women

C. Presents as a well-circumscribed, mobile marble-like mass D. Estrogen sensitive - grows during pregnancy and may be painful during the

menstrual cycle

E. Benign, with no increased risk of carcinoma

IV. PHYLLODES TUMOR

A. Fibroadenoma-like tumor with overgrowth of the fibrous component; characteristic 'leaf-like' projections are seen on biopsy (Fig. 16.4).

B. Most commonly seen in postmenopausal women C. Can be malignant in some cases

BREAST CANCER

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Most common carcinoma in women by incidence (excluding skin cancer) B. 2nd most common cause of cancer mortality in women C. Risk factors are mostly related to estrogen exposure.

178

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

2. Biopsy of calcifications is often necessary to distinguish between benign and malignant conditions.

C. Histologic subtypes are based on architecture; comedo type is characterized by high-grade cells with necrosis and dystrophic calcification in the center of ducts (Fig. 16.5).

D. Paget disease of the breast is DCIS that extends up the ducts to involve the skin of

the nipple (Fig. 16.6). 1. Presents as nipple ulceration and erythema 2. Paget disease of the breast is almost always associated with an underlying

carcinoma.

III. INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA

A. Invasive carcinoma that classically forms duct-like structures B. Most common type of invasive carcinoma in the breast, accounting for > 80% of

cases

C. Presents as a mass detected by physical exam or by mammography

1. Clinically detected masses are usually 2 cm or greater. 2. Mammographically detected masses are usually 1 cm or greater. 3. Advanced tumors may result in dimpling of the skin or retraction of the nipple. D. Biopsy usually shows duct-like structures in a desmoplastic stroma; special subtypes

ii. Poor prognosis
======================================
IV. LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS)

A. Malignant proliferation of cells in lobules with no invasion of the basement membrane

B. LCIS does not produce a mass or calcifications and is usually discovered incidentally on biopsy.

C. Characterized by dyscohesive cells lacking E-cadherin adhesion protein D. Often multifocal and bilateral E. Treatment is tamoxifen (to reduce the risk of subsequent carcinoma) and close

follow-up; low risk of progression to invasive carcinoma

V. INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA

A. Invasive carcinoma that characteristically grows in a single-file pattern (Fig. 16.9);

cells may exhibit signet-ring morphology. 1. No duct formation due to lack of E-cadherin.

VI. PROGNOSTIC AND PREDICTIVE FACTORS

A. Prognosis in breast cancer is based on TNM staging.

1. Metastasis is the most important factor, but most patients present before metastasis occurs.

2. Spread to axillary lymph nodes is the most useful prognostic factor (given that metastasis is not common at presentation); sentinel lymph node biopsy is used to assess axillary lymph nodes.

B. Predictive factors predict response to treatment.

1. Most important factors are estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu gene amplification (overexpression) status.

Central Nervous System Pathology

DEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES

I. NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS

A. Arise from incomplete closure of the neural tube

1. Neural plate invaginates early in gestation to form the neural tube, which runs along the cranial-caudal axis of the embryo.

2. The wall of the neural tube forms central nervous system tissue, the hollow lumen forms the ventricles and spinal cord canal, and the neural crest forms the peripheral nervous system.

B. Associated with low folate levels prior to conception C. Detected during prenatal care by elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in the

amniotic fluid and maternal blood

D. Anencephaly is absence of the skull and brain (disruption of the cranial end of the

neural tube). 1. Leads to a 'frog-like' appearance of the fetus (Fig. 17.1) 2. Results in maternal polyhydramnios since fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid is

impaired

E. Spina bifida is failure of the posterior vertebral arch to close, resulting in a vertebral

defect (disruption of the caudal end of the neural tube). 1. Spina bifida occulta presents as a dimple or patch of hair overlying the vertebral

defect.

2. Spina bifida presents with cystic protrusion of the underlying tissue through the

vertebral defect. i. Meningocele - protrusion of meninges ii. Meningomyelocele - protrusion of meninges and spinal cord
======================================
II. CEREBRAL AQUEDUCT STENOSIS

A. Congenital stenosis of the channel that drains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the 3rd ventricle into the 4th ventricle

B. Leads to accumulation of CSF in the ventricular space; most common cause of

hydrocephalus in newborns 1. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus lining the ventricles. 2. Flows from the lateral ventricles into the 3rd ventricle via the interventricular

foramen of Monro

3. Flows from the 3rd ventricle into the 4th ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct 4. Flows from the 4th ventricle into the subarachnoid space via the foramina of

Magendie and Luschka

C. Presents with enlarging head circumference due to dilation of the ventricles (cranial suture lines are not fused)

III. DANDY-WALKER MALFORMATION

A. Congenital failure ofthe cerebellar vermis to develop

A. Congenital failure of the cerebellar vermis to develop B. Presents as a massively dilated 4th ventricle (posterior fossa) with an absent

cerebellum (Fig. 17.2); often accompanied by hydrocephalus

181

182

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

IV. ARNOLD-CHIARI MALFORMATION (TYPE II)

A. Congenital downward displacement of cerebellar vermis and tonsils through the foramen magnum

B. Obstruction of CSF flow commonly results in hydrocephalus. C. Often associated with meningomyelocele

SPINAL CORD LESIONS

I. SYRINGOMYELIA

A. Cystic degeneration of the spinal cord B. Arises with trauma or in association with a type 1 Arnold-Chiari malformation C. Usually occurs at C8-Tl

1. Presents as sensory loss of pain and temperature with sparing of fine touch and position sense in the upper extremities ("cape like" distribution) - due to involvement of the anterior white commissure of the spinothalamic tract with sparing of the dorsal column (Table 17.1)

D. Syrinx expansion results in involvement of other spinal tracts leading to

1. Muscle atrophy and weakness with decreased muscle tone and impaired reflexes - due to damage to lower motor neurons of the anterior horn

2. Horner syndrome with ptosis (droopy eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (decreased sweating) - due to disruption of the lateral horn of the hypothalamospinal tract (Table 17.1)

IL POLIOMYELITIS

A. Damage to the anterior motor horn due to poliovirus infection B. Presents with lower motor neuron signs - flaccid paralysis with muscle atrophy,

fasciculations, weakness with decreased muscle tone, impaired reflexes, and negative Babinski sign (downgoing toes)
======================================
III. WERDNIG-HOFFMAN DISEASE

A. Inherited degeneration of the anterior motor horn; autosomal recessive B. Presents as a "floppy baby;" death occurs within a few years after birth.

IV. AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS)

A. Degenerative disorder of upper and lower motor neurons of the corticospinal tract

(Table 17.1) 1. Anterior motor horn degeneration leads to lower motor neuron signs - flaccid paralysis with muscle atrophy, fasciculations, weakness with decreased muscle tone, impaired reflexes, and negative Babinski sign.

2. Lateral corticospinal tract degeneration leads to upper motor neuron signs - spastic paralysis with hyperreflexia, increased muscle tone, and positive Babinski sign.

B. Atrophy and weakness of hands is an early sign.

1. Lack of sensory impairment distinguishes ALS from syringomyelia.

C. Most cases are sporadic, arising in middle age adults.

1. Zinc-copper superoxide dismutase mutation (SOD1) is present in some familial cases; leads to free radical injury in neurons

V. FRIEDREICH ATAXIA

A. Degenerative disorder of the cerebellum and spinal cord 1. Degeneration of the cerebellum leads to ataxia. 2. Degeneration of multiple spinal cord tracts leads to loss of vibratory sense and proprioception, muscle weakness in the lower extremities, and loss of deep tendon reflexes.

B. Autosomal recessive; due to expansion of an unstable trinucleotide repeat (GAA) in

the frataxin gene 1. Frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron regulation; loss results in iron

buildup with free radical damage.

C. Presents in early childhood; patients are wheelchair bound within a few years. D. Associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

MENINGITIS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Inflammation of the leptomeninges (Fig. 17.3)

1. Meninges consist of three layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia) that lie between the

C. Presents with classic triad of headache, nuchal rigidity, and fever; photophobia,

vomiting, and altered mental status may also be present. D. Diagnosis is made by lumbar puncture (sampling of CSF).

1. Performed by placing a needle between L4 and L5 (level of the iliac crest). Spinal

cord ends at L2, but subarachnoid space and cauda equina continue to S2. 2. Layers crossed include skin, ligaments, epidural space, dura, and arachnoid.

2 Layers crossed include skin, ligaments, epidural space, dura, and arachnoid. CSF findings

E. CSF findings

1. Bacterial meningitis - neutrophils with ↓ CSF glucose; gram stain and culture often identify the causative organism.

2. Viral meningitis - lymphocytes with normal CSF glucose 3. Fungal meningitis - lymphocytes with ↓ CSF glucose

F. Complications are usually seen with bacterial meningitis. 1. Death - herniation secondary to cerebral edema 2. Hydrocephalus, hearing loss, and seizures - sequelae related to fibrosis

CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Neurologic deficit due to cerebrovascular compromise; major cause of morbidity and mortality

B. Due to ischemia (85% of cases) or hemorrhage (15% of cases)

1. Neurons are dependent on serum glucose as an essential energy source and are particularly susceptible to ischemia (undergo necrosis within 3-5 minutes).

II. GLOBAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA A. Global ischemia to the brain B. Major etiologies

1. Low perfusion (e.g., atherosclerosis) 2. Acute decrease in blood flow (e.g., cardiogenic shock) 3. Chronic hypoxia (e.g., anemia) 4. Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia (e.g., insulinoma)

C. Clinical features are based on duration and magnitude of the insult.

1. Mild global ischemia results in transient confusion with prompt recovery.

Fig. 17.5 Lacunar infarcts. (Courtesy of Robert Wellmann, MD) Fig. 17.4 Pale infarct, cortex. (Courtesy of Robert Wellmann, MD)

Central Nervous System Pathology

2. Severe global ischemia results in diffuse necrosis; survival leads to a 'vegetative state.'

3. Moderate global ischemia leads to infarcts in watershed areas (e.g., area lying

between regions fed by the anterior and middle cerebral artery) and damage to highly vulnerable regions such as i. Pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex (layers 3, 5, and 6) - leads to

laminar necrosis

ii. Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (temporal lobe) - important in long-term memory

iii. Purkinje layer of the cerebellum - integrates sensory perception with motor control
======================================
III. ISCHEMIC STROKE

A. Regional ischemia to the brain that results in focal neurologic deficits lasting > 24

hours 1. If symptoms last < 24 hours, the event is termed a transient ischemic attack

(TIA).

B. Subtypes include thrombotic, embolic, and lacunar strokes.

1. Thrombotic stroke is due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque.

i. Atherosclerosis usually develops at branch points (e.g., bifurcation of internal

carotid and middle cerebral artery in the circle of Willis). ii. Results in a pale infarct at the periphery of the cortex (Fig. 17.4)

2. Embolic stroke is due to thromboemboli.

i. Most common source of emboli is the left side of the heart (e.g., atrial fibrillation).

ii. Usually involves the middle cerebral artery iii. Results in a hemorrhagic infarct at the periphery of the cortex

3. Lacunar stroke occurs secondary to hyaline arteriolosclerosis, a complication of

hypertension. i. Most commonly involves lenticulostriate vessels, resulting in small cystic

i Most commonly involves lenticulostriate vessels, resulting in small cystic areas ofinfarction (Fig. 17.5)

areas of infarction (Fig. 17.5) Involvement of the internal capsule leads to a pure motor stroke. Involvement of the thalamus leads to a pure sensory stroke.

ii. iii.

C. Ischemic stroke results in liquefactive necrosis.

1. Eosinophilic change in the cytoplasm of neurons (red neurons, Fig. 17.6A) is an early microscopic finding (12 hours after infarction).

2. Necrosis (24 hours), infiltration by neutrophils (days 1-3) and microglial cells (days 4-7), and gliosis (weeks 2-3) then ensue.

3. Results in formation of a fluid-filled cystic space surrounded by gliosis (Fig. 17.6B)

3. Rupture of the paramedian artery leads to Duret (brainstem) hemorrhage.

DEMYELINATING DISORDERS

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Myelin insulates axons, improving the speed and efficiency of conduction.

1. Oligodendrocytes myelinate the central nervous system. 2. Schwann cells myelinate the peripheral nervous system.

B. Demyelinating disorders are characterized by destruction of myelin or oligodendrocytes; axons are generally preserved.

II. LEUKODYSTROPHIES

A. Inherited mutations in enzymes necessary for production or maintenance of myelin B. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is due to a deficiency of arylsulfatase (autosomal

Metachromatic leukodystrophy is due to a deficiency of arylsulfatase (autosomal recessive); most common leukodystrophy

recessive); most common leukodystrophy 1. Sulfatides cannot be degraded and accumulate in the lysosomes of

oligodendrocytes (lysosomal storage disease).

C. Krabbe disease is due to a deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (autosomal recessive). 1. Galactocerebroside accumulates in macrophages.

D. Adrenoleukodystrophy is due to impaired addition of coenzyme A to long-chain fatty acids (X-linked defect).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1. Accumulation of fatty acids damages adrenal glands and white matter of the brain.
======================================
III. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

A. Autoimmune destruction of CNS myelin and oligodendrocytes

1. Most common chronic CNS disease of young adults (20-30 years of age); more

commonly seen in women 2. Associated with HLA-DR2 3. More commonly seen in regions away from the equator

B. Presents with relapsing neurologic deficits with periods of remission (multiple

lesions in time and space). Clinical features include 1. Blurred vision in one eye (optic nerve) 2. Vertigo and scanning speech mimicking alcohol intoxication (brainstem) 3. 4. Hemiparesis or unilateral loss of sensation (cerebral white matter, usually

periventricular)

5. Lower extremity loss of sensation or weakness (spinal cord) 6. Bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction (autonomic nervous system)

C. Diagnosis is made by MRI and lumbar puncture.

1. MRI reveals plaques (areas of white matter demyelination). 2. Lumbar puncture shows increased lymphocytes, increased immunoglobulins

with oligoclonal IgG bands on high resolution electrophoresis, and myelin basic protein.

D. Gross examination shows gray-appearing plaques in the white matter (Fig. 17.11). E. Treatment of acute attacks includes high-dose steroids.

1. Long-term treatment with interferon beta slows progression of disease.

IV. SUBACUTE SCLEROSING PANENCEPHALITIS

A. Progressive, debilitating encephalitis leading to death B. Due to slowly progressing, persistent infection of the brain by measles virus.

Infection occurs in infancy; neurologic signs arise years later (during childhood). 1.

C. Characterized by viral inclusions within neurons (gray matter) and oligodendrocytes (white matter)

V. PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY

A. JC virus infection of oligodendrocytes (white matter)

Immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS or leukemia) leads to reactivation of the latent virus.

B. Presents with rapidly progressive neurologic signs (visual loss, weakness, dementia) leading to death

VI. CENTRAL PONTINE MYELINOLYSIS

A. Focal demyelination of the pons (anterior brain stem) B. Due to rapid intravenous correction of hyponatremia

1. Occurs in severely malnourished patients (e.g., alcoholics and patients with liver disease)

C. Classically presents as acute bilateral paralysis ("locked in" syndrome)

E. Histology reveals loss ofpigmented neurons in the substantia nigra and round, eosinophilic inclusions of α-synuclein (Lewy bodies, Fig. l 7.13C) in affected neurons.

F. Dementia is a common feature of late disease.

1. Early-onset dementia is suggestive of Lewy body dementia, which is characterized by dementia, hallucinations and parkinsonian features; histology reveals cortical Lewy bodies.

VI. HUNTINGTON DISEASE

A. Degeneration of GABAergic neurons in the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia (Fig.

17.14) 1. Autosomal dominant disorder (chromosome 4) characterized by expanded

trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in the huntingtin gene

2. Further expansion of repeats during spermatogenesis leads to anticipation. B. Presents with chorea that can progress to dementia and depression; average age at

presentation is 40 years.

Musculoskeletal Pathology

SKELETAL SYSTEM

I. ACHONDROPLASIA

A. Impaired cartilage proliferation in the growth plate; common cause of dwarfism B. Due to an activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3);

autosomal dominant

1. Overexpression of FGFR3 inhibits growth. 2. Most mutations are sporadic and related to increased paternal age.

C. Clinical features

1. Short extremities with normal-sized head and chest - due to poor endochondral

bone formation; intramembranous bone formation is not affected. i. Endochondral bone formation is characterized by formation of a cartilage matrix, which is then replaced by bone; it is the mechanism by which long bones grow. lntramembranous bone formation is characterized by formation of bone without a preexisting cartilage matrix; it is the mechanism by which flat bones (e.g., skull and rib cage) develop. D. Mental function, life span, and fertility are not affected.

II. OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA

A. Congenital defect of bone formation resulting in structurally weak bone B. Most commonly due to an autosomal dominant defect in collagen type I synthesis C. Clinical features

1. Multiple fractures of bone (can mimic child abuse, but bruising is absent) 2. Blue sclera - Thinning of scleral collagen reveals underlying choroidal veins. 3. Hearing loss - Bones of the middle ear easily fracture.

III. OSTEOPETROSIS

A. Inherited defect of bone resorption resulting in abnormally thick, heavy bone that fractures easily

B. Due to poor osteoclast function C. Multiple genetic variants exist; carbonic anhydrase II mutation leads to loss of the

acidic microenvironment required for bone resorption.

D. Clinical features include 1. Bone fractures 2. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia with extramedullary

hematopoiesis - due to bony replacement of the marrow (myelophthisic process, Fig. 18.1)

3. Vision and hearing impairment - due to impingement on cranial nerves 4. Hydrocephalus - due to narrowing of the foramen magnum 5. Renal tubular acidosis - seen with carbonic anhydrase II mutation

i. Lack of carbonic anhydrase results in decreased tubular reabsorption of

1. Bone pain and fractures in weight-bearing areas such as the vertebrae (leads to loss of height and kyphosis), hip, and distal radius

2. Bone density is measured using a DEXA scan. 3. Serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, and alkaline phosphatase are normal; labs help

to exclude osteomalacia (which has a similar clinical presentation).

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

2. Synovium lining the joint capsule secretes fluid rich in hyaluronic acid to lubricate the joint and facilitate smooth motion.

II. DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE (OSTEOARTHRITIS)

A. Progressive degeneration of articular cartilage; most common type of arthritis B. Most often due to 'wear and tear' C. Major risk factor is age (common after 60 years); additional risk factors include

obesity and trauma.

E. Classic presentation is joint stiffness in the morning that worsens during the day. F. Pathologic features include

1. Disruption of the cartilage that lines the articular surface (Fig. 18. 7); fragments of cartilage floating in the joint space are called 'joint mice.'

2. Eburnation of the subchondral bone 3. Osteophyte formation (reactive bony outgrowths); classically arises in the DIP

(Heberden nodes) and PIP (Bouchard nodes) joints of the fingers

III. X-LINKED MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

A. Degenerative disorder characterized by muscle wasting and replacement of skeletal muscle by adipose tissue

B. Due to defects of dystrophin gene

1. Dystrophin is important for anchoring the muscle cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix.

2. Mutations are often spontaneous; large gene size predisposes to high rate of mutation.

C. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is due to deletion of dystrophin.

1. Presents as proximal muscle weakness at 1 year of age; progresses to involve

distal muscles i. Calf pseudohypertrophy is a characteristic finding. ii.

2. Death results from cardiac or respiratory failure; myocardium is commonly

involved.

Skin Pathology

INTRODUCTION

I. SKIN

A. Functions as a barrier against environmental insults and fluid loss B. Composed of an epidermis and dermis C. Epidermis is comprised of keratinocytes and has four layers (Fig. 19.1).

1. Stratum basalis - regenerative (stem cell) layer 2. Stratum spinosum - characterized by desmosomes between keratinocytes 3. Stratum granulosum - characterized by granules in keratinocytes 4. Stratum corneum - characterized by keratin in anucleate cells

D. Dermis consists of connective tissue, nerve endings, blood and lymphatic vessels, and adnexal structures (e.g., hair shafts, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands).
======================================
INFLAMMATORY DERMATOSES

I. ATOPIC (ECZEMATOUS) DERMATITIS

A. Pruritic, erythematous, oozing rash with vesicles and edema; often involves the face and flexor surfaces

B. Type I hypersensitivity reaction; associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis

II. CONTACT DERMATITIS

A. Pruritic, erythematous, oozing rash with vesicles and edema B. Arises upon exposure to allergens such as

1. Poison ivy and nickel jewelry (type IV hypersensitivity) 2. Irritant chemicals (e.g., detergents) 3. Drugs (e.g., penicillin)

C. Treatment involves removal of the offending agent and topical glucocorticoids, if needed.

III. ACNE VULGARIS

A. Comedones (whiteheads and blackheads), pustules (pimples), and nodules; extremely common, especially in adolescents

B. Due to chronic inflammation of hair follicles and associated sebaceous glands 1. Hormone-associated increase in sebum production (sebaceous glands have androgen receptors) and excess keratin production block follicles, forming comedones.

2. Propionibacterium acnes infection produces lipases that break down sebum, releasing proinflammatory fatty acids; results in pustule or nodule formation

C. Treatment includes benzoyl peroxide (antimicrobial) and vitamin A derivatives (e.g., isotretinoin), which reduce keratin production.

IV. PSORIASIS

A. Well-circumscribed, salmon-colored plaques with silvery scale, usually on extensor surfaces and the scalp (Fig. 19.2A); pitting of nails may also be present.

B. Due to excessive keratinocyte proliferation

Skin Pathology

B. Due to IgG antibody against desmoglein (type II hypersensitivity) C. Presents as skin and oral mucosa bullae (Fig. 19.4A).

1. Acantholysis (separation) of stratum spinosum keratinocytes (normally connected by desmosomes) results in suprabasal blisters.

2. Basal layer cells remain attached to basement membrane via hemidesmosomes ('tombstone' appearance, Fig. 19.4B).

3. Thin-walled bullae rupture easily (Nikolsky sign), leading to shallow erosions

with dried crust. Immunofluorescence highlights IgG surrounding keratinocytes in a 'fish net' pattern.

4.

II. BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID

A. Autoimmune destruction of hemidesmosomes between basal cells and the underlying basement membrane

B. Due to IgG antibody against hemidesmosome components (BP180) of the basement membrane

C. Presents as blisters of the skin (Fig. 19.5A), usually in the elderly; oral mucosa is

spared. 1. Basal cell layer is detached from the basement membrane (Fig. 19.5B). 2. Tense bullae do not rupture easily; clinically milder than pemphigus vulgaris D. Immunofluorescence highlights IgG along basement membrane (linear pattern).

III. DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS

A. Autoimmune deposition of IgA at the tips of dermal papillae B. Presents as pruritic vesicles and bullae that are grouped (herpetiform, Fig. 19.6) C. Strong association with celiac disease; resolves with gluten-free diet

and chronic inflammation (e.g., scar from burn or draining sinus tract). C. Presents as an ulcerated, nodular mass, usually on the face (classically involving the

lower lip)

D. Treatment is excision; metastasis is uncommon. E. Actinic keratosis is a precursor lesion of squamous cell carcinoma and presents as a

hyperkeratotic, scaly plaque, often on the face, back, or neck.

F. Keratoacanthoma is well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that develops rapidly and regresses spontaneously; presents as a cup-shaped tumor filled with keratin debris

DISORDERS OF PIGMENTATION AND MELANOCYTES

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Melanocytes are responsible for skin pigmentation and are present in the basal layer

of the epidermis. 1. Derived from the neural crest 2. Synthesize melanin in melanosomes using tyrosine as a precursor molecule 3. Pass melanosomes to keratinocytes

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY
======================================
II. VITILIGO

A. Localized loss of skin pigmentation (Fig. 19.11) B. Due to autoimmune destruction of melanocytes

III. ALBINISM

A. Congenital lack of pigmentation B. Due to an enzyme defect (usually tyrosinase) that impairs melanin production C. May involve the eyes (ocular form) or both the eyes and skin (oculocutaneous form) D. Increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma due

to reduced protection against UVB

IV. FRECKLE (EPHELIS)

A. Small, tan to brown macule; darkens when exposed to sunlight B. Due to increased number of melanosomes (melanocytes are not increased)

V. MELASMA

A. Mask-like hyperpigmentation of the cheeks B. Associated with pregnancy and oral contraceptives

VI. NEVUS (MOLE)

A. Benign neoplasm of melanocytes B. Congenital nevus is present at birth; often associated with hair (Fig. 19.12) C. Acquired nevus arises later in life.

1. Begins as nests of melanocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction (junctional nevus); most common mole in children

2. Grows by extension into the dermis (compound nevus) 3. Junctional component is eventually lost resulting in an intradermal nevus, which

is the most common mole in adults.

D. Characterized by a flat macule or raised papule with symmetry, sharp borders, evenly distributed color, and small diameter(< 6 mm)

E. Dysplasia may arise (dysplastic nevus), which is a precursor to melanoma.

VII. MELANOMA

A. Malignant neoplasm of melanocytes; most common cause of death from skin cancer B. Risk factors are based on DVB-induced DNA damage and include prolonged

exposure to sunlight, albinism, and xeroderma pigmentosum; an additional risk factor is dysplastic nevus syndrome (autosomal dominant disorder characterized by formation of dysplastic nevi that may progress to melanoma).

C. Presents as a mole-like growth with "ABCD" (Fig. 19.13)

Fig. 19.13 Melanoma. (Courtesy of Vesna Petronic-Rosic, MD)

Skin Pathology

1. Asymmetry 2. Borders are irregular. 3 Color is not uniform. . 4. Diameter > 6 mm

D. Characterized by two growth phases

1. Radial growth horizontally along the epidermis and superficial dermis; low risk of metastasis

2. Vertical growth into the deep dermis

Increased risk of metastasis; depth of extension (Breslow thickness) is the most important prognostic factor in predicting metastasis.

E. Variants include

1. Superficial spreading - most common subtype; dominant early radial growth results in good prognosis.

2. Lentigo maligna melanoma - lentiginous proliferation (radial growth); good prognosis

3. Nodular - early vertical growth; poor prognosis 4. Acral lentiginous - arises on the palms or soles, often in dark-skinned

individuals; not related to UV light exposure
======================================
INFECTIOUS DISORDERS

I.

IMPETIGO A. Superficial bacterial skin infection, most often due to S aureus or S pyogenes B. Commonly affects children C. Presents as erythematous macules that progress to pustules, usually on the face; rupture of pustules results in erosions and dry, crusted, honey-colored serum.

II. CELLULITIS

A. Deeper (dermal and subcutaneous) infection, usually due to S aureus or S pyogenes B. Presents as a red, tender, swollen rash with fever C. Risk factors include recent surgery, trauma, or insect bite. D. Can progress to necrotizing fasciitis with necrosis of subcutaneous tissues due to

infection with anaerobic 'flesh-eating' bacteria 1. Production of CO2 leads to crepitus. 2. Surgical emergency

III. STAPHYLOCOCCAL SCALDED SKIN SYNDROME

A. Sloughing of skin with erythematous rash and fever; leads to significant skin loss B. Due to S aureus infection; exfoliative A and B toxins result in epidermolysis of the

stratum granulosum.
