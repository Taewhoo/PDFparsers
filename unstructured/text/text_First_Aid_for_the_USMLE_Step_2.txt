Preface

With the 11th edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 2 CK, we continue our commitment to providing students with the most high-yield and up-to-date preparation guide for the USMLE Step 2 CK exam. Preparation for and performance on the Step 2 CK exam are more important than ever with the transition of the Step 1 exam to a pass/fail scoring system in 2022. With this in mind, we have greatly expanded the content and depth for the 11th edition. This revision includes:

Over 200 additional pages of content incorporating the most current evidence-based reviews and recommendations to help students on the Step 2 CK exam and in clinical practice.

163 new and revised diagrams and illustrations, including more than 40 new diagnostic and management algorithms, to further drive home the next best diagnostic and management options.

140 new and revised photos/images to help visualize various disorders, descriptive findings, and clinical content tie-ins.

Extensive text revisions, new mnemonics, and clarifications curated by a team of 26 medical student and resident physician authors who excelled on their USMLE exams and verified by a team of expert faculty advisors and nationally recognized USMLE instructors.

physician authors whorexcelled advisors and nationally presentation and,the best outline and blueprint in the margins to Rapid.Review section for

Continued focus on clinical presentation and the best initial step in diagnosis and management, mirroring the content outline and blueprint of Step 2 CK.

Vignette-style flash cards embedded in the margins to reinforce key concepts. Heavily updated and revised Rapid Review section for last-minute preparation. Revised rating of current high-yield review resources, with clear explanations of their

INTRODUCTION

The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 2 allows you to pull together your clinical experience on the wards with the numerous “factoids” and classical disease presentations that you have memorized over the years. Where Step 1 stresses basic disease mechanisms and principles, Step 2 places more emphasis on clinical diagnosis and management, disease pathogenesis, and preventive medicine. Previously, the Step 2 examination consisted of the Step 2 Clinical Knowledge examination (Step 2 CK), and the Step 2 Clinical Skills examination (Step 2 CS). However, recent changes have removed the

Step 2 CS exam as a requirement for ECFMG certification after the onset of the pandemic, and this change has been recorded as permanent by the ECFMG.

The USMLE Step 2 CK is the second of three examinations that you must pass to become a licensed physician in the United States. The computerized Step 2 CK is a 1-day (9-hour) multiple-choice examination.
======================================
KEY FACT

The goal of the Step 2 CK is to apply your knowledge of medical facts to clinical scenarios that you may encounter as a resident.

USMLE STEP 2 CK—COMPUTER-BASED TESTING BASICS 

WHO CAN REGISTER FOR THE EXAM?

The eligibility requirement for USMLE Step 2 CK exam is same as that of USMLE Step 1 and can be taken either before or after the Step 1 exam. This means that you should be:

graduate of, a US or or graduate of, a US medical graduate ofa medical Medical Schools as ECFMG criteria.

Officially enrolled in, or be a graduate of, a US or Canadian medical school leading to the MD degree (LCME accredited), or

Officially enrolled in, or be a graduate of, a US medical school leading to the DO degree (COCA accredited), or

Officially enrolled in, or be a graduate of, a medical school outside the US and Canada and listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools as meeting ECFMG eligibility requirements and meet other ECFMG criteria.

These criteria should be met at the time of application and on the test day.

HOW WILL THE CBT BE STRUCTURED?

The Step 2 CK exam is a computer-based test (CBT) administered by Prometric, Inc. It is a 1- day examination with a maximum of 318 items divided into eight 1-hour blocks that are administered during a single 9-hour testing session. The number of items in a block are displayed at the beginning of each block. This number may vary from block to block but will not exceed 40 items per block.

Two question styles predominate throughout. The most common format is the single one- best-answer question. This is the traditional multiple-choice format in which you are tasked with selecting the “most correct” answer. Sequential item sets comprises the second question style. These are sets of multiple-choice questions that are related and must all be answered in sequence without skipping a question in the set. As you answer questions in a set, the previous answers become locked and cannot be changed. These are the only questions on the USMLE examination that are locked in such a way. There are no more than five sequential item sets within each USMLE Step 2 CK exam.
======================================
KEY FACT

Sometimes the answer to the previous question in a sequential question set is provided to you once you lock your answer. Do not be disheartened if you got it wrong. Simply understand that you now have an opportunity to get at least one answer correct in the sequence.

During the time allotted for each block in the USMLE Step 2 CK exam, you can answer test questions in any order and can also review responses and change your answers (except for responses within the sequential item sets described earlier). However, under no circumstances can you return to previous blocks and change your answers. Once you have finished a block, you must click on a screen icon to continue to the next block. Time not used during a testing block will be added to your overall break time (45 minutes total at start of exam), but it cannot be used to complete other testing blocks. Also note that a short tutorial (shorter than the one available at the USMLE website) is present at the start of the exam, which if you choose to skip, can add 15 minutes to your total break time.

KEY FACT

Expect to spend up to 9 hours at the test center.

TESTING CONDITIONS: WHAT WILL THE CBT BE LIKE?

and the Prometric'test USMLE Web allowed.to bring personal soft-foam earplugs as outerwear, watches Food and

Even if you are familiar with CBT and the Prometric test centers, you should still access the latest practice software from the USMLE Web site (http://www.usmle.org) and try out prior to the examination.

For security reasons, you are not allowed to bring personal equipment (except those needed for medical reasons and soft-foam earplugs as detailed later) into the testing area— which means that writing implements, outerwear, watches (even analog), cellular telephones, and electronic paging devices are all prohibited. Food and beverages are prohibited as well. The proctor will assign you a small locker to store your belongings and any food you bring for the day. You will also be given two 8 cm × 11 cm laminated writing surfaces, pens, and erasers for note taking and for recording your test Candidate Identification Number (CIN). You must return these materials after the examination. Note that you are not allowed to write on these until you enter the CIN number in the computer. Testing centers are monitored by audio and video surveillance equipment, and minimum of 2 surveillance rounds by the exam monitor per hour. Each time you enter the testing room, you will have to undergo a screening process to ensure that you are not bringing in personal items.

You should become familiar with a typical question screen. A window to the left displays all the questions in the block and shows you the unanswered questions (marked with an “i”). Some questions will contain figures, color illustrations, audio, or video adjacent to the question. Although the contrast and brightness of the screen can be adjusted, there are no other ways to manipulate the picture (eg, zooming or panning). Larger images are accessed with an “exhibit” button. You can also call up a window displaying normal lab values. You may mark questions to review at a later time by clicking the check mark at the top of the screen. The annotation feature functions like the provided dry-erase sheets and allows you to jot down notes during the examination. Play with the highlighting/strike-out and annotation features with the vignettes and multiple answers.

You should also do a few practice blocks to determine which tools will help you process questions more efficiently and accurately. If you find that you are not using the marking,

annotation, or highlighting tools, then keyboard shortcuts can be quicker than using a mouse. Headphones are provided for listening to audio and blocking outside noise. Alternatively, you can bring soft earplugs to block excess noise. These earplugs must be examined by Prometric staff before you can take them into the testing area.
======================================
KEY FACT

Keyboard shortcuts: A–E—Letter choices. Enter or space bar—Move to the next question. Esc—Exit pop-up Lab and Exhibit windows. Alt-T—Countdown and time-elapsed clocks for current session and overall test.

WHAT DOES THE CBT FORMAT MEAN FOR ME?

The CBT format is the same format as that used on the USMLE Step 1. If you are uncomfortable with this testing format, spend some time playing with a Windows-based system and pointing and clicking icons or buttons with a mouse.

The USMLE also offers students an opportunity to take a simulated test, or practice session, at a Prometric center. The session is divided into three 1-hour blocks of up to 50 questions each. The approximately 127 Step 2 CK sample test items that are available on the USMLE Web site (http://www.usmle.org) are the same as those used at CBT practice sessions. No new items are presented. The cost is about $75 for US and Canadian students but is higher for international students. Students receive a printed percent-correct score after completing the session. No explanations of questions are provided. You may register for a practice session online at http://www.usmle.org.

127 Step 2 CK sample are the same as The cost is.about Students receive a of questions are http://www.usmle.org. Examiners (NBME)

to assess their Step 2 CK knowledge with the Comprehensive Clinical Science Self- Assessment (CCSSA) test. This test is available on the NBME Web site for $60, which will display at the end of the exam all of the questions that you answered incorrectly. The current versions of the test also have answer explanations. The content of the CCSSA items resembles that of the USMLE Step 2 CK. After you complete the CCSSA, you will be given a performance profile indicating your strengths and weaknesses. This feedback is intended for use as a study tool only and is not necessarily an indicator of Step 2 CK performance. For more information on the CCSSA examination, visit the NBME’s Web site at http://www.nbme.org, and click on the link for “Students and Residents.”
======================================
HOW DO I REGISTER TO TAKE THE EXAMINATION?

Information on the Step 2 CK exam’s format, content, and registration requirements are found on the USMLE Web site. To register for the examination, students/graduates of accredited schools in the United States and Canada can apply online at the NBME Web site (http://www.nbme.org), whereas students/graduates of non-US/Canadian schools should apply through the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) (https://iwa2.ecfmg.org). A printable version of the application is also available on these sites.

The preliminary registration process for the USMLE Step 2 CK exam is as follows:

Complete a registration form and send your examination fees to the NBME (online) for students in US/Canada medical schools, and to the ECFMG (online) for international medical students. The fees payable are outlined in Table 1.1.

TABLE 1.1 Exam Fees for the USMLE Step 2 CK

FEE PAYABLE TO NBME FEE PAYABLE TO ECFMG (US AND CANADA SCHOOLS ONLY) (ALL OTHER SCHOOLS) Exam fee $645 $985 Scheduling charge $210 Eligibility period extension $70 $100 Changing testing region $90 $90 Requesting exam recheck $80 $80

Select a 3-month block in which you wish to be tested (eg, June/July/August). Attach a passport-type photo to your completed application form. Complete a Certification of Identification and Authorization form. This form must be

signed by an official at your medical school such as from the registrar’s office (if you are a student) or a notary public (if you have graduated) to verify your identity. It is valid for 5 years, allowing you to use only your USMLE identification number for future transactions.

and medical school such as.from have graduated) to your USMLE identification form tothe NBME for before ‘the test date, but prior to the eligibility

Send your certified application form to the NBME for processing. Applications may be submitted more than 6 months before the test date, but examinees will not receive their scheduling permits until 6 months prior to the eligibility period.

The NBME will process your application within 4–6 weeks and will send you a slip of paper that will serve as your scheduling permit.

Once you have received your scheduling permit, decide when and where you would like to take the examination. For a list of Prometric locations nearest you, visit https://www.prometric.com.

Call Prometric’s toll-free number or visit https://www.prometric.com to arrange a time to

take the examination. The Step 2 CK is offered on a year-round basis except for the first 2 weeks in January. For

the most up-to-date information on available testing days at your preferred testing location, refer to http://www.usmle.org.

The scheduling permit you receive from the NBME will contain the following important information:

Your USMLE identification number. The eligibility period during which you may take the examination. Your “scheduling number,” which you will need to make your examination appointment

with Prometric.

Your CIN, which you must enter at your Prometric workstation in order to access the examination.

Prometric has no access to the codes and will not be able to supply these numbers, so do

not lose your permit! You will not be allowed to take the Step 2 CK unless you present your permit along with an unexpired, government-issued photo identification that contains your signature (eg, driver’s license, passport). Make sure the name on your photo ID exactly matches the name that appears on your scheduling permit.
======================================
KEY FACT

Because the Step 2 CK examination is scheduled on a “first-come, first-served” basis, you should be sure to call Prometric as soon as you receive your scheduling permit.

WHAT IF I NEED TO RESCHEDULE THE EXAMINATION?

You can change your date and/or center within your 3-month period by contacting Prometric if space is available. When you reschedule, a fee may apply (Table 1.2).

TABLE 1.2 Rescheduling Fees Payable to Prometric for USMLE Step 2 CK (1 Jan, 2022)

RESCHEDULING TIME FEES FOR THE US FEES FOR TESTING REGIONS BEFORE EXAM DATE AND CANADA TESTING REGION OTHER THAN THE US AND CANADA 46 days or more No fee No fee Between 31 and 45 days $35 $35 Between 6 days and 30 days $100 $100 Less than 5 days $144 $369

If you need to reschedule outside your initial 3-month period, you can apply for a single 3- month extension (eg, April/May/June can be extended through July/August/September) after your eligibility period has begun. For other rescheduling needs, you must submit a new application along with another application fee.

WHAT ABOUT TIME?

Time is of special interest on the CBT examination. The following is a breakdown of the examination schedule:
======================================
Tutorial 15 minutes 1-hour question blocks (40 questions per block) 8 hours Break time (includes time for lunch) 45 minutes Total test time 9 hours

9 hours

The computer will keep track of how much time has elapsed during the examination. However, the computer will show you only how much time you have remaining in a block. Therefore, it is up to you to determine if you are pacing yourself properly.

The computer will not warn you if you are spending more than the 45 minutes allotted for break time. The break time includes not only the usual concept of a break—when you leave

the testing area—but also the time it takes for you to make the transition to the next block, such as entering your CIN or even taking a quick stretch. If you do exceed the 45-minute break time, the time to complete the last block of the test will be reduced. However, you can elect not to use all of your break time, or you can gain extra break time either by skipping the tutorial or by finishing a block ahead of the allotted time.

SECURITY MEASURES

Smile! The USMLE uses a check-in/check-out process that includes electronic capture of your fingerprints and photograph. Fingerprints from a finger on each hand will be used for this process. These measures are intended to increase security by preventing fraud, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the examination. These procedures also decrease the amount of time needed to check in and out of the examination throughout the day, thereby maximizing your break time. However, you still need to sign out and sign in with the Test Center Log when exiting and entering the testing area.

IF I LEAVE DURING THE EXAMINATION, WHAT HAPPENS TO MY SCORE?

You are considered to have started the examination once you have entered your CIN onto the computer screen, but to receive an official score, you must finish the entire examination. This means that you must start and either finish or run out of time for each block of the examination. If you do not complete all of the question blocks, your examination will be documented on your USMLE score transcript as an incomplete attempt, but no actual score will be reported.

The examination ends when all blocks have been completed or time has expired. As you leave the testing center, you will receive a written test completion notice to document your completion of the examination.
======================================
WHAT TYPES OF QUESTIONS ARE ASKED?

The Step 2 CK is an integrated examination that tests understanding of normal conditions, disease categories, and physician tasks. Almost all questions on the examination are case based. Some questions will involve interpreting a study or drug advertisement. A substantial amount of extraneous information may be given, or a clinical scenario may be followed by a question that could be answered without actually requiring that you read the case. It is your job to determine which information is superfluous and which is pertinent to the case at hand. Content areas include internal medicine, OB/GYN, pediatrics, preventive services, psychiatry, surgery, and other areas relevant to the provision of care under supervision (see Tables 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5).

any time. competencies may also assess

Most questions on the examination have a single best-answer format. The part of the vignette that actually asks the question—the stem—is usually found at the end of the scenario and generally relates to the physician task. From student experience, there are a few stems that are consistently addressed throughout the examination:

What is the most likely diagnosis? (40%) Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management? (20%) Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (20%) Which of the following is the most likely cause of…? (5%) Which of the following is the most likely pathogen…? (3%) Which of the following would most likely prevent…? (2%) Other (10%)

Additional examination tips are as follows:

Note the age and race of the patient in each clinical scenario. When ethnicity is given, it is often relevant. Know these well (see high-yield facts), especially for more common diagnoses.

Be able to recognize key facts that distinguish major diagnoses. Questions often describe clinical findings rather than naming eponyms (eg, they cite

“audible hip click” instead of “positive Ortolani sign”).

Questions about acute patient management (eg, trauma) in an emergency setting are common.

The cruel reality of the Step 2 CK examination is that no matter how much you study, there will still be questions you will not be able to answer with confidence. If you recognize that a question cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time, make an educated guess and move on; you will not be penalized for guessing. Also bear in mind that some of the USMLE questions are “experimental” and will not count toward your score.
======================================
HOW LONG WILL I HAVE TO WAIT BEFORE I GET MY SCORES?

The USMLE reports scores 3–4 weeks after the examinee’s test date. During peak periods, however, as many as 6 weeks may pass before reports are scored. This usually includes scheduled delays after the first two weeks of the year in January when the scores may get delayed up to March. Official information concerning the time required for score reporting is posted on the USMLE Web site, http://www.usmle.org and recent changes may need to be checked every testing session.

Like the Step 1 score report, your Step 2 CK report includes your pass/fail status, a numeric score, and a performance profile organized by discipline and disease process (see Fig. 1.1). The score is a 3-digit scaled score based on a predefined proficiency standard. The current required passing score is 214. This score requires answering 60–70% of questions correctly.

DEFINING YOUR GOAL

Step 2 CK scores are becoming increasingly used for residency selection. The amount of time spent in preparation for this examination varies widely among medical students. Possible goals include the following:

Beating the mean. This signifies an ability to integrate your clinical and factual knowledge to an extent that is superior to that of your peers (around 247 for recent examination administrations). Others redefine this goal as achieving a score 1 standard

deviation above the mean (usually in the range of 250–260). Highly competitive residency programs may use your Step 1 and Step 2 scores (if available) as a screening tool or as a selection requirement. International medical graduates should aim to beat the mean, as USMLE scores are likely to be a selection factor even for less competitive US residency programs.

Acing the exam. Perhaps you are one of those individuals for whom nothing less than the best will do—and for whom excelling on standardized examinations is a source of pride and satisfaction.

rationale for taking the Step 2 CK, as it is technically the reason the examination was initially designed. The case-based nature of the Step 2 CK differs significantly from the more fact-based Step 1 examination in that it more thoroughly assesses your ability to recognize classic clinical presentations, deal with emergent situations, and follow the step- by-step thought processes involved in the treatment of particular diseases.

Preparing for internship. Studying for the USMLE Step 2 CK is an excellent way to review and consolidate all of the information you have learned in preparation for internship.

Matching statistics, including examination scores related to various specialties, are available at the National Resident Matching Program Web site at https://www.nrmp.org under “Data and Reports.”

do in your. exam have a-wide variety to consider: as defined earlier.
======================================
WHEN TO TAKE THE EXAM

The second most important thing to do in your exam preparation is to decide when to take the examination. With the CBT, you now have a wide variety of options regarding when to take the Step 2 CK. Here are a few factors to consider:

The nature of your objectives, as defined earlier. The specialty to which you are applying. An increasing number of residency programs

are viewing the Step 2 CK as an integral part of the residency application process. Several research publications demonstrate the increasing importance placed on this examination by residency directors. Some programs are now requiring the Step 2 CK score in order to rank candidates for a residency position. It is therefore in the best interest of candidates to have this examination done in time for scores to be available for the residency application. Taking the examination in June or July ensures that scores will be available for the Match period that begins in September. Some programs, however, will accept scores after the application process starts. Check with programs in your desired specialty to determine when to take the exam.

Prerequisite to graduation. If passing the USMLE Step 2 CK is a prerequisite to graduation at your medical school, you will need to take the examination in the fall or winter at the latest.

Proximity to clerkships. Many students feel that the core clerkship material is fresher in their minds early in the fourth year, making a good argument for taking the Step 2 CK earlier in the fall.

The nature of your schedule. Considerations for MD/PhD students. The dates of passing the Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 examinations should occur within a 7-year period. However, the typical pathway for MD/PhD students consists of 2–3 years of preclinical (and sometimes clinical) work in

medical school, 3–4 years of graduate work with research, and finally returning to medical school for clinical work. MD/PhD students typically exceed the 7-year limit. Depending on the state in which licensure is sought, such students may need to petition their licensure body for an exception to this rule.

Considerations for International Medical Graduates. A passing score on the Step 2 CK is required to qualify for ECFMG certification which is necessary to match. It is generally recommended to take the Step 2 CK early enough to obtain ECFMG certification before interview season is completed, ideally even before applications are reviewed by programs.
======================================
KEY FACT

The Step 2 CK is an opportunity to consolidate your clinical knowledge and prepare for internship.

HOW WILL THE STEP 2 CK SCORE AFFECT MY MATCH?

Since Step 1 is now being reported as pass or fail, it is expected that the Step 2 CK score may take on more importance. Programs receive hundreds if not thousands of applications yearly, and they rely on certain objective metrics to select applicants to interview. Having a competitive Step 2 CK score will not guarantee a match at a top choice program but it will strengthen your application. It is one of many elements that programs will consider.

STUDY RESOURCES

QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS

Although an ever-increasing number of USMLE Step 2 CK review books and software packages are available on the market, the quality of these materials is highly variable (see Section 3). Some common problems include the following:

Some review books are too detailed to be reviewed in a reasonable amount of time or cover subtopics that are not emphasized on the examination (eg, a 400-page anesthesiology book).

Many sample question books have not been updated to reflect current trends on the Step 2 CK.

Many sample question books use poorly written questions, contain factual errors in their explanations, give overly detailed explanations, or offer no explanations at all.

Software for boards review is of highly variable quality, may be difficult to install, and may be fraught with bugs.

CLINICAL REVIEW BOOKS

Many review books are available, so you must decide which ones to buy by carefully evaluating their relative merits. Toward this goal, you should compare different opinions from other medical students; read the reviews and ratings in Section 3 of this guide, and examine the various books closely in the bookstore. Do not worry about finding the “perfect” book, as many subjects simply do not have one.

KEY FACT

The best review book for you reflects the way you like to learn. If a given review book is not working for you, stop using it no matter how highly rated it may be.

There are two types of review books: those that are stand-alone titles and those that are part of a series. Books in a series generally have the same style, and you must decide if that style is helpful for you and optimal for a given subject.
======================================
TEST BANKS

A test bank can serve multiple functions, including the following:

Provide information about strengths and weaknesses in your fund of knowledge. Add variety to your study schedule. Serve as the main form of study. Improve test-taking skills. Familiarize examinees with the style of the USMLE Step 2 CK examination.

Students report that some test banks have questions that are, on average, shorter and less clinically oriented than those on the current Step 2 CK exam. Step 2 CK questions demand fast reading skills and the application of clinical facts in a problem-solving format. Approach sample examinations critically, and do not waste time with low-quality test bank questions until you have exhausted better sources.

current Step 2 CK of clinical facts in’a do not waste time with sources. and areas of weakness,

KEY FACT

Use test banks to identify concepts and areas of weakness, not just facts that you missed.

After you have taken a practice test, try to identify concepts and areas of weakness, not just the facts that you missed. Use this experience to motivate your study and to prioritize the areas in which you need the most work. Analyze the pattern of your responses to questions to determine if you have made systematic errors in answering questions. Common mistakes include reading too much into the question, second-guessing your initial impression, and misinterpreting the question.

TEXTS AND NOTES

Most textbooks are too detailed for high-yield boards review and should be avoided. When using texts or notes, engage in active learning by making tables, diagrams, new mnemonics, and conceptual associations whenever possible. If you already have your own mnemonics, do not bother trying to memorize someone else’s. Textbooks are useful; however, they are best used to supplement incomplete or unclear material.

COMMERCIAL COURSES

Commercial preparation courses can be helpful for some students, as they offer an effective way to organize study material. However, multiweek courses are costly and require

significant time commitment, leaving limited time for independent study. Also note that some commercial courses are designed for first-time test takers, students who are repeating the examination, or international medical graduates.
======================================
NBME/USMLE PUBLICATIONS

We strongly encourage students to use the free materials provided by the testing agencies and to study the following NBME publications:

HOW TO USE THE DATABASE

The 11th edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 2 CK contains a revised and expanded database of clinical material that student authors and faculty have identified as high yield for boards review. We have organized information according to subject matter, whether medical specialty (eg, Cardiovascular, Renal) or high-yield topic (eg, Health Systems Science). Each subject then branches out into smaller subsections of related facts.

Individual facts appear in a logical fashion, from basic definitions and epidemiology to history/physical exam, diagnosis, and treatment. Lists, mnemonics, pull quotes, vignette flash cards, and tables help the reader form key associations. In addition, we have interspersed color and black-and-white photos throughout the text. At the end of Section 2, we also feature a Rapid Review chapter consisting of key facts and classic associations that can be studied a day or two before the exam.

The content contained herein is useful primarily for the purpose of reviewing material already learned. The information presented is not ideal for learning complex or highly conceptual material for the first time.

complement your core study material, not as your primary study source. We have condensed and edited the facts and notes to emphasize essential material. Work with the material, add your own notes and mnemonics, and recognize that not all memory techniques work for all students.

We update material to keep current with new trends in boards content, as well as to expand our database of high-yield information. However, we must note that our database inevitably does not include many other high-yield entries and topics.

We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit entries and mnemonics so that we may enhance the database for future students. We also solicit recommendations for additional study tools that may be useful in preparing for the exam, such as diagrams, charts, and computer-based tutorials (see How to Contribute, p. xi).
======================================
DISCLAIMER

The entries in this section reflect student opinions of what is high yield. Owing to the diverse sources of material, we have made no attempt to trace or reference origins of individual entries. We have regarded mnemonics as essentially in the public domain. We will gladly correct errors and omissions if brought to the attention of the authors, either through the publisher or directly by email.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

An ECG provides an assessment of the electrical activity of the heart. The heart rate, rhythm, axis, intervals, ischemia, and chamber enlargement can be evaluated (Fig. 2.1-1).

FIGURE 2.1-1. Normal electrocardiogram from a healthy subject. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

KEY FACT

*Heart rate = 300/number of large boxes between two consecutive QRS complexes. *Presuming ECG recorded at usual speed (25 mm/sec), where each large box = 200 msec and each small box = 40 msec.

Rate Normal adult heart rate (HR) is 60–100 beats/min (bpm). HR <60 bpm is bradycardia. Heart rate >100 bpm is tachycardia. Common causes of sinus bradycardia are physical fitness, sick sinus syndrome, drugs, vasovagal attacks, acute myocardial infarction (MI), and ↑ intracranial pressure. Common causes of sinus tachycardia are anxiety, anemia, pain, fever, sepsis, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary embolism, hypovolemia, thyrotoxicosis,

carbon dioxide (CO2) retention, and sympathomimetics.

Rhythm Sinus rhythm: Normal rhythm that originates from the sinus node. It is characterized by a P wave (upright in leads II, III, and aVF; inverted in lead aVR) preceding every QRS complex and a QRS complex following every P wave. Sinus arrhythmia is a sinus rhythm originating from the sinoatrial (SA) node with cyclical beat-to-beat variation (>120 milliseconds [msec]) in the P-P interval and a constant P-R interval, which results in an irregular ventricular rate. It is common in young adults and is considered a normal variant.

Axis The QRS axis represents the direction in which the mean QRS current flows. It can be determined by examining the QRS in leads I, II, and aVF (see Table 2.1-1 and Fig. 2.1-2).
======================================

Intervals PR interval: Normally 120 to 200 msec (3–5 small boxes).

Prolonged = delayed atrioventricular (AV) conduction (eg, first-degree heart block). Short = fast AV conduction down accessory pathway (eg, Wolff-Parkinson-White

[WPW] syndrome).

QRS interval: Normally <120 msec. A normal Q wave is <40 msec wide and <2 mm deep. Ventricular conduction defects can cause a widened QRS complex (>120 msec): Left bundle-branch block (LBBB): Deep S wave and no R wave in V1 (“W” shaped); wide, tall and broad, or notched (“M”-shaped) R waves in I, V5, and V6 (Fig. 2.1-3). A new LBBB is pathologic, and it may be suggestive of acute MI. However, this is not diagnostic in isolation. Rather, the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria (see key fact) should be used for the ECG diagnosis of acute MI in this situation (higher sensitivity and specificity).
======================================
KEY FACT

Smith-Modified Sgarbossa Criteria are used to diagnose MI in the presence of LBBB should be suspected in a patient with LBBB and the following ECG findings: Concordant ST elevation (STE) ≥1 mm in ≥1 lead Concordant ST depression ≥1 mm in ≥1 lead of V1–V3 Excessive discordant STE in ≥1 lead with ≥1 mm STE, where excessive discordance is

defined as STE to the maximum QRS amplitude ratio ≥25%

Right bundle-branch block (RBBB): RSR′ complex (“rabbit ears;” “M”-shaped); qR or R morphology with a wide R wave in V1; QRS pattern with a wide S wave in I, V5, and V6 (see Fig. 2.1-3).

FIGURE 2.1-3. Bundle branch block. Characteristic ECG findings in left bundle branch block (A) and right bundle branch block (B) are seen in leads V1 and V6. (Modified with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

QT interval: Normally QTc (the QT interval corrected for extremes in heart rate) is 380 to 440 msec (QTc = QT/√RR). QTc may be prolonged (QTc >440 msec) due to acquired causes, including electrolyte derangements (↓ K+, ↓ Ca2+, ↓ Mg2+) and medications (macrolides, fluroquinolones, opioids, ondansetron, Classes Ia [quinidine, procainamide] and III [sotalol, amiodarone] antiarrhythmic drugs). Congenital causes include long QT syndrome (LQTS), an underdiagnosed disorder that predisposes to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, torsade de pointes) and sudden cardiac death (SCD, see later). Romano Ward syndrome is the most common congenital cause of LQTS with

drugs). disorder that pointes) and sudden the most common Presents as a purely syndrome is an autosomal channel. conduction. Most syncope.on exercise, ventricular

autosomal dominant inheritance. Presents as a purely cardiac phenotype (no deafness).

Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is an autosomal recessive cause of LQTS caused by a defect in K+ channel conduction. Most likely diagnosis in a child with sensorineural deafness, syncope on exercise, ventricular arrhythmias, and prolonged QT. Treat with β-blockers and implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker.

Within hours, peaked T-waves and ST-segment changes (either depression or elevation). Within 24 hours, T-wave inversion and ST-segment resolution. Within a few days, pathologic Q waves (>40 msec or more than one-third of the QRS

amplitude). Q waves usually persist, but may resolve in 10% of patients. Because of this,

Q waves signify either acute or prior ischemic events.

Non–Q-wave infarcts (also known as subendocardial infarcts) have ST and T changes without Q waves.

In a normal ECG, R waves increase in size compared to the S wave between leads V1 and V5. Poor R-wave progression refers to abnormalities in this pattern (eg, reversed progression [R in V2 > V3], transition point beyond V4, R in V3 <3 mm) and can be a sign of new or prior anterior infarction, although it is not specific.
======================================
MNEMONIC

Pulmonale causes Peaked P waves. Mitrale causes M-shaped P waves.

Chamber Enlargement

Atrial enlargement: Right atrial abnormality (P pulmonale): Generally, the right atrium (RA) depolarizes before the left. Right atrial enlargement (due to pulmonary hypertension [eg, chronic obstructive, pulmonary disease, tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia]) causes slowed conduction; therefore peak right atrial depolarization coincides with left. This results in increased P-wave amplitude (>2.5 mm in lead II).

Left atrial abnormality (P mitrale): Left atrial enlargement causes prolonged left atrial (LA) depolarization, increased P-wave duration (>120 msec in lead II), and sometimes a notched P wave (also in lead II). Also, the P wave in lead V1 may have a large negative deflection (>1 small square wide and 1 small square deep in a standard tracing). Commonly seen in isolation in mitral stenosis or associated with LV hypertrophy.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, Fig. 2.1-5):

FIGURE 2.1-5. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Shown are leads V1, V2, V5, and V6. S wave in V1 + R wave in V5 = 45 mm. Note ST changes and T-wave inversion in V5 and V6, suggesting strain. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Amplitude of S in V1 + R in V5 or V6 is >35 mm. Alternative criteria: The amplitude of R in aVL + S in V3 is >28 mm in men or >20

mm in women.

Usually associated with ST depression and T-wave changes. Causes include hypertension (most common), aortic stenosis/regurgitation, mitral

regurgitation, coarctation of the aorta, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

KEY FACT

Axis deviation can be a sign of ventricular enlargement.

Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH):

Right-axis deviation and an R wave in V1 >7 mm. Causes include pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, chronic lung disease (cor pulmonale), mitral stenosis, and congenital heart disease (eg, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary stenosis).

CARDIAC PHYSICAL EXAM

Key exam findings that can narrow the differential include the following: Jugular venous distention (JVD): >3 cm above the sternal angle when head of the bed is at 30 to 45 degrees of inclination. Most typically from volume overload, stemming from conditions such as right heart failure or pulmonary hypertension.

Hepatojugular reflux: Distention of neck veins upon applying pressure to the liver. Seen in same conditions as JVD.

Kussmaul sign: ↑ in jugular venous pressure (JVP) with inspiration. Often seen in constrictive pericarditis.

Mechanism of Tachyarrhythmias The primary mechanisms of tachyarrhythmias include abnormal automaticity, triggered activity, and re-entry.

Abnormal automaticity: Myocardial tissue that does not normally pace the heart (ie, no automaticity) may develop automaticity due to pathologic mechanisms (eg, ischemia, metabolic disturbances). Examples include accelerated idioventricular rhythm or multifocal atrial tachycardia.

Triggered activity: Due to oscillations (called afterdepolarizations) in the membrane potential of cardiomyocytes that occur during or immediately after an action potential. If afterdepolarizations cross a critical threshold, a new action potential is generated. Examples include torsade de pointes.

Reentry: Most common cause of tachyarrhythmias. Two distinct pathways connect to form a circuit. Conduction down this circuit could sustain a fixed and stable wavefront, which depolarizes the myocardium (Fig. 2.1-9). Examples include AVRT and AVNRT.

======================================
FIGURE 2.1-9. Mechanism of re-entry at the AV node. The AV node has a slow-conducting pathway with a short refractory period and a fast-conducting pathway with a long refractory period. During normal sinus rhythm, impulses are conducted down both pathways simultaneously but only transmitted to the His bundle down the fast pathway (myocardium is refractory once the slow impulse arrives) (A). A premature atrial contraction could arrive when the fast pathway is still refractory but the slow pathway is able to conduct (B). When the impulse from the slow pathway reaches the His bundle, the fast pathway is no longer refractory, thus allowing retrograde conduction up the fast pathway (C). This impulse may continuously cycle through the fast and slow pathways, resulting in a reentry tachycardia, ie,

AVNRT (D). Other reentrant tachycardias may share a similar mechanism. ERP: Effective refractory period. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-RX.com.)

Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. It results in disorganized atrial electrical activity and an irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm. This causes increased rates of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. See Table 2.1-4 for a summary.

Risk Factors AF is associated with increased age, hypertension, valvular disease, heart failure (HF),

CAD, lung disease (PE, chronic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea).

Other reversible causes such as hyperthyroidism, electrolyte derangements, and substance use (caffeine or drugs) should be excluded on initial evaluation.

Pathophysiology Often triggered by irregularly depolarizing cells near the ostia of the pulmonary veins that

result in disorganized atrial electrical activity.

This results in an irregularly irregular pattern of ventricular contractions. Chronic AF may results in structural changes to the atrium.

Classification AF may be valvular (associated with mitral stenosis or prosthetic valve) or nonvalvular. It may be new-onset/recurrent, paroxysmal (self-limited), persistent (>7 days), long-

with mitral stenosis or paroxysmal (self-limited), (not looking to asymptomatic.to hemodynamically Sometimes chest thromboembolic

standing (>12 months), or permanent (not looking to restore sinus rhythm).

History/PE Presentation ranges from asymptomatic to hemodynamically unstable. May have palpitations, fatigue, and dyspnea. Sometimes chest discomfort or even syncope. Importantly, can present with thromboembolic complications initially (eg, stroke,

mesenteric).

PE: Irregular pulse, irregular jugular venous pulsations.

FIGURE 2.1-10. ECG findings in atrial fibrillation. No discernible P waves, with variable and irregular QRS response (RR interval varies irregularly). (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

Labs: Electrolytes, complete blood count (CBC), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; hyperthyroidism should always be considered).

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): To identify structural issues (eg, atrial size, valve disease).

Treatment Patients with AF may require anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism. Also, either a

rate control or rhythm control strategy may be implemented to manage the arrythmia (see p. 32).

Q

A college-aged man passes out without any inciting factors and has no prodromal symptoms or signs of seizure. After recovery, his cardiac exam is unremarkable, and an ECG shows a slurred upstroke of the QRS. What are the next best steps?

Stroke prevention with long-term anticoagulation.

Consider the risk of thromboembolism (estimated by CHADS-VASc score; refer to

Key Fact) and risk of bleeding (HASBLED score) when deciding on anticoagulation. Generally, CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 in men and ≥3 in women merits anticoagulation with warfarin, dabigatran (thrombin inhibitor), or rivaroxaban (factor Xa inhibitor). In patients with a low risk of bleeding, anticoagulation may be considered in men with

a score ≥1 and women with a score ≥2.

KEY FACT

The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system can estimate stroke risk in AF. Score of ≥2 in men or ≥3 in women: Recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant or warfarin. Anticoagulation may be considered at a lower score (1 in men, 2 in women): CHF (1 point) HTN (1 point) Age ≥75 (2 points) Diabetes (1 point) Stroke or TIA history (2 points) Vascular disease (1 point) Age 65–74 (1 point) Sex category (female) (1 point)

anticoagulation with a direct at a lower score (1 in
======================================
Stroke prevention with devices:

Often, thrombi that cause stroke in AF form within the left atrial appendage (LAA), a small outpouching of the LA.

As an alternative to anticoagulation, minimally invasive occlusion of the LAA can prevent stroke. Considered for patients at risk for stroke but who cannot tolerate anticoagulation (eg, high bleeding risk).

Surgical closure of LAA is also possible in those who require cardiac surgery.

Rate control:

Control of ventricular rate is equal to (and often preferred over) rhythm control with regard to mortality benefit. Target ventricular rate of <110 bpm is often used.

Medications: β-blockers (best initial Rx) and nondihydropyridine CCBs. Digitalis is sometimes used as an adjunct to improve rate control.

Procedures: Last resort for rate control is AV nodal ablation with implantation of a pacemaker.

Rhythm control: Rhythm control does not improve mortality but may relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in select patients. Options include electrical cardioversion,

pharmacologic cardioversion, and catheter ablation.

Hemodynamically unstable patient: Immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated. Elective cardioversion and anticoagulation: For stable patients requiring

cardioversion.

This is WPW syndrome. The next best steps include prescribing procainamide, which treats arrhythmias, as well as referring for electrophysiologic evaluation and advising against physical activity. Syncope suggests unstable hemodynamics and raises suspicion for concurrent atrial fibrillation (AF). AV node blockers are contraindicated (adenosine, β- blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [CCBs]), even if AF develops.

AF duration >48 hours: High risk of thromboembolism. Three weeks anticoagulation given before cardioversion. Alternatively, transesophageal echocardiography can rule out LA thrombus, followed by cardioversion.

AF duration <48 hours: Lower thromboembolic risk. May cardiovert without prior anticoagulation. Some patients should still receive anticoagulation as soon as possible or after cardioversion based on thromboembolic risk.

Anticoagulation should be continued for 4 weeks post-cardioversion. Anticoagulant choice: Nonvalvular AF: IV heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, and new oral anticoagulants. Valvular AF: Only warfarin for mitral stenosis.

Nonvalvular AF: IV heparin, new oral anticoagulants. Drugs can-be used propafenone, dofetilide, procedure that can electrically cause AF discharge)

Pharmacologic cardioversion: Drugs can be used to cardiovert and maintain sinus rhythm (eg, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, amiodarone, or IV ibutilide).
======================================
Ablation:

A minimally invasive procedure that can electrically isolate pulmonary veins (from which abnormal cells that cause AF discharge) from the rest of the LA. This can result in restoration of sinus rhythm.

A similar procedure can be done surgically (Cox-maze procedure) for individuals requiring cardiac surgery.

KEY FACT

Evidence of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (δ waves) on ECG calls for use of procainamide, not nodal blockers, for supraventricular tachycardias.

KEY FACT

Avoid vasopressors in hypovolemic shock until adequate fluid resuscitation has been provided. Vasopressors ↑ total peripheral resistance and BP but ↓ blood flow in tissues that undergo vasoconstriction. Autoregulation reduces the effect of vasopressors on vital organs so they maintain perfusion.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE

HF is a syndrome typified by a constellation of clinical symptoms (eg, breathlessness, ankle swelling) and signs (eg, JVP, pulmonary crackles). Structural or functional cardiac abnormalities result in elevated cardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or on exertion. Etiologically, it can be related to valvular, pericardial, endocardial, vascular, or conduction abnormalities, among other causes. Risk factors include coronary heart disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, diabetes, and COPD (cor pulmonale).

CLASSIFICATION

Based on Ejection Fraction HF is divided into distinct phenotypes based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). LVEF >40% is heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Also known as

systolic HF (Table 2.1-8).

TABLE 2.1-8. Comparison of Systolic and Diastolic Dysfunction

LVEF 41% to 49% is heart failure with moderately reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). LVEF ≥50% is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). For diagnosis of

HFpEF there must be evidence of symptoms/signs of HF, structural/functional abnormalities supporting LV diastolic dysfunction, and/or increased natriuretic peptides. Also known as diastolic HF (see Table 2.1-8).

There may also be primarily right ventricular (RV) heart failure (Table 2.1-9).

Based on Timing of Onset Heart failure may be chronic (gradual progression with established diagnosis). Chronic HF may acutely worsen (acute decompensated HF). Also, acute exacerbations of HF can occur without chronic HF.

Other Classifications New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is based on functional status (Table

2.1-10).

TABLE 2.1-10. NYHA Functional Classification of Congestive Heart Failure

CLASS DESCRIPTION I No limitation of activity; no symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, and fatigue) with normal activity ll Slight limitation of activity; comfortable at rest or with mild exertion Ul Marked limitation of activity; comfortable only at rest IV Any physical activity brings on discomfort; symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, and fatigue) present at rest

Killip classification grades HF severity after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Predicts mortality at 30 days.

Etiology HFrEF (aka systolic HF) is caused by compensatory mechanisms (sympathetic nervous system [SNS] and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [RAAS] activation) to inciting conditions (eg, valvular disease, HTN) that may be acutely beneficial but may become maladaptive chronically (Fig. 2.1-11).

FIGURE 2.1-11. Pathophysiology of heart failure. Activation of the RAAS and SNS may initially help the failing heart adapt by increasing contractility, heart rate, and circulating volume. However, deleterious cardiac remodeling may lead to worsening HF and pulmonary edema over time (red boxes). Drugs that target the various maladaptive processes are shown (blue boxes). (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Chronic activation of the SNS and RAAS results in cardiac and vascular remodeling (eg, hypertrophy, fibrosis, vasoconstriction), as well as sodium and water retention. Activation

of the SNS leads to increased afterload (vasoconstriction/hypertension), whereas activation of the RAAS results in increased preload (salt and water retention).
======================================
KEY FACT

The most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure.

History/PE Exertional dyspnea that progresses to orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND),

and finally dyspnea at rest.

Chronic cough, fatigue, and peripheral edema may be reported. Exam: Weight gain, bilateral pulmonary rales, increased JVP, positive hepatojugular

reflex, peripheral edema, elevated and sustained LV impulse, and an S3 gallop.

Diagnosis HFrEF presents with the clinical syndrome of HF, with typical signs and symptoms, in

addition to reduced EF(<40%).

Studies that may support the diagnosis include the following:

Best initial test: Echocardiogram (transthoracic echocardiogram). ↓ EF helps establish HFrEF; structural abnormalities may help identify cause (eg, AF, old MI, or LVH).

ECG: May show MI, heart block, arrhythmia, or other diagnostic clues. CXR: May show cardiomegaly, cephalization of pulmonary vessels, pleural effusions,

vascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and prominent hila (Fig. 2.1-12).

FIGURE 2.1-12. X-ray of the chest (CXR) with evidence of congestive heart failure. Frontal CXR demonstrates marked cardiomegaly, cephalization of vessels (arrow), interstitial edema (circle), and small left-sided pleural effusion, which raise concern for CHF.

Lab abnormalities: Brain natriuretic peptide >500 pg/mL, ↓ CBC (anemia), ↑ creatinine (sometimes), ↓ sodium in later stages, ↑ or ↓ TSH/T4 levels.

Treatment Acute congestive heart failure: The first step in management is clinical identification of the hemodynamic profile.

Specifically, the level of congestion (“wet” vs “dry”) and perfusion (“warm” vs “cold”) must be evaluated. Treatment is determined based on this evaluation, as illustrated in Table 2.1-11.

KEY FACT

Acute CHF management Upright positioning Vasodilators Diuretics Inotropes Oxygen if hypoxic Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation Mechanical support

In “warm and wet” patients (adequately perfused), loop diuretics and vasodilators are the best initial treatment.

In “cold and wet” patients with hypotension (hypoperfused), loop diuretics may actually worsen perfusion by reducing intravascular volume. Therefore inotropic agents are used initially to augment perfusion, and direct vasodilators are added if BP can tolerate it.

Oxygen administered only if hypoxemic (SpO2 <90%). Loop diuretics (most commonly) for preload reduction. Vasodilators to counter elevated filling pressures or LV afterload. Nitroglycerin is better for preload reduction (primarily venous vasodilation; useful in HF with predominant congestion) and nitroprusside for afterload reduction (arterial and venous vasodilation; useful in HF with severe HTN).

Inotropic agents (milrinone, dobutamine, dopamine) and vasopressors (norepinephrine, high-dose dopamine, and vasopressin) may increase myocardial oxygen demand and worsen HF. Their use is indicated in hypotensive patients with impaired perfusion (“wet and cold”), who would not be able to tolerate diuretics. Once perfusion is restored, diuretics can be used.

Other treatments include sodium and fluid restriction and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis (LMWH, fondaparinux or unfractionated heparin).

Initiation of β-blockers is contraindicated during decompensated HF, but should be restarted once the patient is euvolemic. If the patient was previously on β-blockers,

continuation may be considered, with or without dose reduction, based on the severity of decompensation.

Opiates (such as morphine) should be avoided if possible. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS: intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation device, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, short-term LV assist devices) considered in patients with HFrEF and severe hemodynamic compromise.

Correct underlying causes such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and drugs (eg, CCBs, antiarrhythmics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], alcohol, anemia, thyroid and valvular disease, high-output states).

======================================
Dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Indicated for patients with HFrEF to ↓ hospitalization and mortality regardless of whether the patient has diabetes.

Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate: May ↓ mortality and ↓ morbidity in persistently symptomatic (NYHA III–V) Black Americans.

Digoxin: Increases cardiac contractility. Symptomatic control of dyspnea and ↓ frequency of hospitalizations.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and a statin are recommended if the underlying cause is a prior MI.

KEY FACT

ACEIs/ARBs, ARNI, β-blockers, spironolactone or eplerenone, hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, and implantable defibrillators have mortality benefit in HFrEF (systolic dysfunction) but not HFpEF (diastolic dysfunction). Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have mortality benefit in HFpEF and HFrEF. Loop diuretics and digoxin (as well as other positive inotropic agents) are for symptomatic relief only and confer no mortality benefit. CCBs may ↑ mortality.

Loop diuretics lose calcium; thiazides take it in. Both cause hypokalemia and hyperuricemia.

Device therapy:

ICD indicated in symptomatic patients (NYHA II/III) with an EF <35% at 40 days post-MI and 3 months post-revascularization. Shown to ↓ mortality.

ICD indicated in asymptomatic patients (NYHA I) with an EF <30% at 40 days post- MI and 3 months post-revascularization. Shown to ↓ mortality risk.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT, aka biventricular pacemaker) is most beneficial for symptomatic patients (NYHA class II/III/ambulatory IV symptoms) with LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, LBBB with a QRS ≥150 msec, who are on optimal HF therapy.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD), cardiac transplantation, other investigational therapies, or palliative care may be necessary in patients who are unresponsive to optimal medical and device therapies (such as ICD and CRT).

KEY FACT

Digoxin toxicity presents with cardiovascular, GI, and neurologic symptoms. Drugs such as amiodarone, β-blockers, verapamil, macrolides, or amphotericin B may precipitate digoxin toxicity. Cardiotoxicity may result in atrial tachycardia with AV block, as seen in the figure (P waves [red arrows] and only one QRS is conducted [green arrow], ie, 5:1 block).

Digoxin effect refers to “normal” ECG changes in patients taking digoxin. Downsloping ST depression that looks like a “reverse tick” (red arrow).

======================================
HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION

HFpEF is defined by ↓ ventricular compliance with normal systolic function (LVEF ≥50%). The ventricle has either impaired active relaxation (secondary to hypertension, ischemia, aging, and/or hypertrophy) or impaired passive filling (scarring from prior MI, restrictive cardiomyopathy). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ↑, cardiac output remains essentially normal, and EF is normal or ↑.

History/PE Associated with stable and unstable angina, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, arrhythmias, MI, heart failure, and sudden death.

Diagnosis HFpEF presents with a clinical syndrome of HF with typical signs and symptoms in

addition to preserved EF (≥50%). There must be evidence of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities supporting the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction.

Investigations that may support the diagnosis include the following:

Best initial test: Echocardiogram (transthoracic echocardiogram). Establishes preserved EF (≥50%) and signs of diastolic dysfunction/raised LV filling pressures (LV mass index, LA volume index, E/e’ ratio at rest).

Lab tests: Natriuretic peptides generally elevated, although 20% of patients have normal values.

Invasive exercise testing.

Treatment Best initial treatments: Diuretics for symptom relief only (see Table 2.1-12). Investigational therapy: Empagliflozin is the only drug to reduce mortality in HFpEF. Screening for specific etiologies and instituting relevant treatments. Treatment of comorbidities (eg, maintain rate and BP control via β-blockers [first-line],

ACEIs, ARBs, or CCBs).

Digoxin and spironolactone are not beneficial in these patients.

KEY FACT

Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin reduce mortality in HFpEF.

CARDIOMYOPATHY

Myocardial disease; categorized as dilated, hypertrophic, or restrictive (Table 2.1-13 and Fig. 2.1-13). Pathology may be confined to the heart (primary) or due to systemic conditions affecting the heart (secondary).

DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY

LV dilation and ↓ EF must be present for diagnosis. Most cases are idiopathic or genetic, but secondary (and acquired) causes include alcohol, postviral myocarditis, postpartum status, drugs (doxorubicin, zidovudine, cocaine), radiation, endocrinopathies (thyrotoxicosis, acromegaly, pheochromocytoma), infection (coxsackievirus, HIV, Chagas disease, parasites), genetic factors, and nutritional disorders (wet beriberi). The most common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype is myocardial ischemia; however, this is classified as a separate condition.

KEY FACT

An S3 gallop signifies rapid ventricular filling in the setting of fluid overload and is associated with DCM. An S3 gallop sounds similar to the word “KEN-tuc-ky.”

History/PE

Often presents with gradual development of CHF symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion and diffuse edema of the ankles, feet, legs, and abdomen.

Exam often reveals displacement of the LV impulse, JVD, rales, an S3/S4 gallop, or mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.

KEY FACT

An S4 gallop signifies a stiff, noncompliant ventricle and ↑ “atrial kick” and may be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An S4 gallop sounds similar to the word “Tenn-es-SEE.”

Diagnosis Best diagnostic test: Echocardiography. CXR shows an enlarged, “balloon-like” heart and pulmonary congestion.

Treatment Address the underlying etiology (eg, alcohol use, endocrine disorders, infection). Treat CHF as noted in earlier section with lifestyle changes, and pharmacologic

treatments.

for a CHF exacerbation medications include what medications would
======================================
Q

A man was admitted to the hospital for a CHF exacerbation with low EF. The patient is now ready for discharge, and his medications include furosemide and metoprolol. Assuming no contraindications, what medications would be appropriate to add to his treatment regimen?

HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic condition with autosomal dominant inheritance characterized by impaired LV relaxation and filling (diastolic dysfunction) due to thickened ventricular walls. In HCM, asymmetric hypertrophy of the interventricular septum may occur, which may result in LV outflow tract obstruction and impaired ejection of blood, ie, HCM with obstruction (aka hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [HOCM]). HCM with obstruction is the most likely cause of SCD in young adults in the United States, mediated primarily by VF.

Note: Other causes of LVH include HTN (most common cause), aortic stenosis, and systemic diseases (glycogen/lysosomal storage diseases, Fabry, amyloid, sarcoid, and hemochromatosis), but these are considered separate entities from HCM.

KEY FACT

HOCM is the most common cause of sudden death in young, healthy athletes in the United States.

History/PE Most common presentation: Syncope or SCD in a young, healthy athlete. Patients are often asymptomatic but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness,

dyspnea, palpitations, angina, or SCD.

Key finding is a harsh systolic ejection crescendo-decrescendo murmur in the lower left sternal edge that ↑ with ↓ preload (eg, Valsalva maneuver, standing) and ↓ with ↑ preload (eg, passive leg raise).

Symptoms worsen with exercise, diuretics, dehydration, ACEIs/ARBs, digoxin, and hydralazine.

Exam also often reveals a sustained apical impulse, an S4 gallop, paradoxical S2, and an abnormal bifid or bisferiens pulse (sudden quick rise followed by a slower longer rise due to LV outflow tract obstruction).

Diagnosis Best initial test: Echocardiography is diagnostic and shows an asymmetrically

hypertrophied interventricular septum. Dynamic obstruction of blood flow (due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve against hypertrophied septum) may also be seen (HOCM).

ECG may be normal or show signs of LVH and nonspecific ST- and T-wave changes. Septal Q waves are common in HCM (inferior and lateral leads).

CXR may reveal left atrial enlargement (LAE) secondary to mitral regurgitation.

enlargement (LAE) secondary LVH and must be it from athlete’s depolarization/repolarization
======================================
KEY FACT

Athlete’s heart may also present with LVH and must be differentiated from HCM. Characteristics of HCM that distinguish it from athlete’s heart include positive family history, ECG features (presence of depolarization/repolarization abnormalities in HCM), and echocardiographic features (enlarged LA, ↓ LV cavity size, LV thickness >15 mm, focal septal hypertrophy, and LV diastolic dysfunction in HCM).

Treatment Best initial treatment: β-blockers are the best initial therapy for symptomatic relief in

both HCM and HOCM; nondihydropyridine CCBs (negative inotropic effect) and ventricular pacemakers are second-line agents.

Digoxin and spironolactone are contraindicated, as they worsen obstruction in HOCM. Diuretics may help in HCM but are contraindicated in HOCM.

Implantable defibrillators should be used in symptomatic HOCM patients. Patients should avoid intense athletic competition and training. Surgical options for HOCM with persistent symptoms include partial excision or alcohol

ablation of the myocardial septum.

Surgical septal myomectomy is reserved for patients when medical and catheter procedures fail.

KEY FACT

Infants born to mothers with diabetes are at risk of developing HCM caused by fetal hyperinsulinemia in response to maternal hyperglycemia. Most infants are asymptomatic,

but some develop LV outflow tract obstruction and HF. Treatment is IV fluids and β- blockers. The condition spontaneously regresses by age 1.

Appropriate medications to add would be an ACEI (or ARB/ARNI), spironolactone, and empagliflozin (or dapagliflozin) to this patient’s current regimen. These have been shown to have a ⊕ mortality benefit in patients with HF with reduced EF.

ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Myocytes are replaced with fibrofatty tissue, causing RV dilation, resulting in ventricular arrhythmias, HF, and SCD. It is the second most common cause of SCD in young people (after HOCM).
======================================
History/PE Most common presentation: Palpitations due to ventricular arrhythmias. Also may

present with syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, SCD, or without symptoms.

(echocardiography or combined with family dilatation and.wall motion epsilon, waves at the

Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on structural (echocardiography or MRI), histologic (endocardial

biopsy), and ECG abnormalities, combined with family history.

Echocardiography shows RV dilatation and wall motion abnormalities. ECG shows

inverted T waves in V1–V3, with epsilon waves at the end of the QRS complex (Fig. 2.1- 14).

Epsilon wave is a small positive deflection at the end of the ORS complex v1

FIGURE 2.1-14. ECG in ARVD shows typical epsilon waves (arrow) in V1. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Treatment Avoid physical activity. Goals: Prevention of SCD (ICD), suppression of arrhythmia (β-blockers [first line],

antiarrhythmic drugs [amiodarone, sotalol]), treatment of CHF (as described earlier), and anticoagulation (ie, for RV thrombus only).

Invasive: ICD, heart transplantation (severe cases), genetic counseling for relatives.

RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY

A

Decreased elasticity of myocardium leading to impaired diastolic filling without significant systolic dysfunction (a normal or near-normal EF). It is caused by infiltrative disease (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis [Table 2.1-14]), scleroderma, Loeffler eosinophilic endocarditis, endomyocardial fibrosis, or scarring and fibrosis (secondary to radiation).

======================================
Diagnosis Echocardiography is key for diagnosis, with rapid early filling and a near-normal or

elevated EF. CXR, MRI, and cardiac catheterization are helpful for characterization (eg,

sarcoid, amyloidosis).

Cardiac biopsy may reveal fibrosis or evidence of infiltration. ECG frequently shows LBBB; low voltages are seen in amyloidosis.

Treatment Treat the underlying cause. Therapeutic options are limited and are generally palliative only. Medical treatment includes cautious use of diuretics for fluid overload and vasodilators to ↓ filling pressure.

SECONDARY CARDIOMYOPATHY

Secondary cardiomyopathies are caused by systemic diseases that affect the heart. Classified into infiltrative (hemochromatosis), inflammatory (sarcoidosis), endocrine

(acromegaly, hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus [DM]), and drug induced (anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, radiation). Some examples are provided in Table 2.1- 14.

KEY FACT

Fifty to seventy percent of patients with AL amyloidosis have cardiac involvement, and this is the main prognostic determinant.

This patient has evidence of DCM. An echocardiogram would be the next best diagnostic step.

Also known as ischemic heart disease (IHD) or atherosclerotic heart disease. Clinical manifestations include stable and unstable angina, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, arrhythmias, MI, HF, and sudden death. Risk factors include the following:

DM Family history of premature CAD (men <55 years of age, women <65 years of age). Smoking Hyperlipidemia

Abdominal obesity HTN Age (men >45 years of age, women age >55 years of age) Male sex CAD risk equivalents include DM, symptomatic carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial

disease, chronic kidney disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

KEY FACT

Major risk factors for CAD include advanced age, male sex, ↑ LDL cholesterol, ↓ HDL cholesterol, HTN, a family history, and smoking. MI in menstruating women is rare.

ANGINA PECTORIS

Substernal chest pain secondary to myocardial ischemia (O2 supply and demand mismatch). This is most often caused by atheroma (likely >70% stenosis of a coronary vessel). Less frequently caused by anemia, aortic stenosis, tachyarrhythmias, HCM, and small vessel disease.

History/PE The classic triad consists of (1) substernal chest pain that is (2) provoked by stress or

substernal chest pain that rest or nitrates (stable characteristics, it is characteristics, it is usually from 2 to 10 armand may be associated

exertion and is (3) relieved by rest or nitrates (stable angina).

If the chest pain meets 3/3 of these characteristics, it is considered typical chest pain. If the chest pain meets 2/3 of these characteristics, it is considered atypical chest pain. The duration of stable angina is usually from 2 to 10 minutes (ACS is normally 10–30

minutes in duration).

Pain can radiate to the neck or arm and may be associated with shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, dizziness, or lightheadedness.

Pain is usually described as dull, squeezing, tightness, or pressure-like (Patients often describe it as “someone sitting on my chest”).

Ischemic pain is not tender, positional, or pleuritic.
======================================
KEY FACT

Chest pain that is sharp/stabbing (pleuritic chest pain) or chest pain that changes with position, breathing, or touch is less likely to be ischemic.

Diagnosis Best initial test: ECG for any type of chest pain. It is usually normal in angina pectoris,

but it may show ST depression, flat or inverted T waves, or signs of past MI.

Cardiac enzymes (CK-MB/troponin): Stable angina will have normal troponins. These are usually drawn in the emergent setting subsequently after the ECG.

CXR: This is to primarily help rule out other causes of chest pain, like aortic dissection (widened mediastinum), esophageal perforation (widened mediastinum/pleural effusion), PE, or pneumonia (pleural effusion/lung consolidation).

Stress testing: Exercise or pharmacologic stress tests detect inducible myocardial

ischemia. Figure 2.1-15 details diagnostic test selection in patients with suspected stable angina.

Stress tests are appropriate for diagnosis of CAD among patients with intermediate pretest probability (predictive value is low with low pretest probability).

β-blockers, CCBs, and nitrates are held 48 hours prior to stress test (cause false- negative results).

ST-segment or wall-motion changes (using echo) with exercise or pharmacologic stress (dobutamine echo or dipyridamole thallium) are diagnostic of CAD.
======================================
KEY FACT

Dipyridamole and adenosine stress test are contraindicated in: 1. Active bronchospasm/reactive airway disease (ie, asthma) 2. Second-degree or third-degree heart block, sick sinus syndrome, or severe bradycardia 3. SBP <90 mm Hg 4. With methylxanthines

Coronary angiography or CT coronary angiogram: Coronary angiography, or a less

invasive diagnostic test, CT coronary angiogram (availability varies among centers), may be used as a last resort if ECG or stress testing is equivocal. Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain.

KEY FACT

Coronary Steal Syndrome Adenosine and dipyridamole are coronary vasodilators that dilate normal coronary arteries more than rigid stenosed arteries. These drugs may cause perfusion to improve in normal vessels and decrease in diseased vessels ("steal of flow") which can result in detectable ischemia. Vasodilator stress tests do not rely on inducing coronary steal, although sometimes they cause it.

Differential Diagnosis Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): History of hoarseness, bad taste, and cough;

relief of symptoms with proton pump inhibitors confirms diagnosis.

Musculoskeletal/costochondritis: Tenderness to palpation and movement. Pneumonia/pleuritis: Pain worsening with breathing (pleuritic) and often accompanied

by fever and productive cough.

Pulmonary embolism: Shortness of breath/hypoxia, tachycardia, hemoptysis, signs of deep vein thrombosis on physical exam, history of cancer, or recent surgery. Chest pain may also be pleuritic.

Aortic dissection: Tearing chest pain that radiates to the back along with unequal radial pulses.

Esophageal perforation: History of vomiting/recent endoscopy with presentation of

fever, chest pain, crepitus/subcutaneous emphysema on physical exam. Anxiety: Patients may have history of panic disorder or anxiety attacks. Shingles: Pain and vesicular rash in a unilateral bandlike (dermatomal) distribution that

does not cross the midline.

Treatment Chronic stable angina: ASA and antianginal drugs (see later).

β-blockers are the first-line therapy for chronic stable angina. They work by reducing myocardial contractility and heart rate (reduced oxygen demand relieves ischemia). Nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) are an alternative that work through a similar mechanism.

Nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin) relieve pain by dilating capacitance veins (↓ preload) resulting in ↓ in LV end-diastolic pressure and wall stress.

Ranolazine is used in refractory angina and reduces intracellular calcium in myocytes, thus allowing complete relaxation during diastole, ↓ myocardial wall stress and end- diastolic pressure.

Antiplatelet drugs as indicated (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel). Initiate risk factor reduction (eg, smoking, cholesterol, HTN) and start ACEIs/ARBs, lipid-lowering therapies (ie, statins), and smoking cessation. Hormone replacement therapy is not protective in postmenopausal women.
======================================
PRINZMETAL (VARIANT) ANGINA

Mimics angina pectoris but is caused by vasospasm of smooth muscles of the coronary arteries.

Typically occurs in young smokers (age <50 years) with minimal risk factors for atherosclerosis.

Treatment: Non-dihydropyridine CCBs with or without long-acting nitrates. Aspirin is

avoided, as it can aggravate the ischemic attacks. β-blockers are contraindicated, as they can ↑ vasospasm.

KEY FACT

ASA and β-blockers may have mortality benefit in many patients with angina caused by coronary artery disease. However, it is important to avoid these medications if the angina is purely vasospastic (Prinzmetal angina).

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES

A spectrum of clinical syndromes caused by plaque disruption or vasospasm that leads to acute myocardial ischemia.

UNSTABLE ANGINA/NON–ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

Patient history and cardiac biomarkers distinguish unstable angina, stable angina, and non– ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Figure 2.1-16 compares key features of stable angina, unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI.

FIGURE 2.1-16. Comparison between key features of stable angina and acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI). (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Unstable angina (UA): Chest pain that is (1) new onset, (2) accelerating (ie, occurs with less exertion, lasts longer, or is less responsive to medications), or (3) occurs at rest suggests UA (in contrast to stable angina). Like stable angina, UA has no elevated cardiac biomarkers, suggesting myocardial ischemia without necrosis. However, unlike stable angina, UA suggests possible impending infarction due to plaque instability.

In contrast to UA, NSTEMI presents with myocardial necrosis, as evidenced by elevations in troponins and creatine kinase–MB isoenzyme (CK-MB). ST-segment elevations are not seen on ECG, differentiating it from STEMI).
======================================
KEY FACT

Acute coronary syndrome: UA: ECG—no ST elevation; cardiac biomarkers ⊖. NSTEMI: ECG—no ST elevation; cardiac biomarkers ⊕. STEMI: ECG—ST elevation; cardiac biomarkers ⊕.

Diagnosis ECG: Best initial diagnostic test. Best initial diagnostic test. Serial ECGs should be

performed (at baseline, then every 15–30 minutes initially) to identify progression to MI. UA and NSTEMI are not associated with ST elevation, but other ECG changes may be seen (eg, ST depression, T-wave inversion, nonspecific changes).

Cardiac markers (CK-MB/troponin):

UA is not associated with elevated cardiac markers. NSTEMI is associated with elevations in cardiac markers.

Risk stratification: Assess mortality risk (eg, TIMI, GRACE, and HEART scores). Timing of coronary angiography ± percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) depends on risk assessment.

Echocardiography should be done routinely to assess for signs of ischemia, rule out other causes of chest pain, and assess baseline cardiac function (predictor of prognosis).

Treatment Best initial treatment: Admit to cardiac care unit (CCU) and monitor closely. Oxygen administration if SaO2 <90% or breathless. Antiplatelet therapy: ASA (↓ mortality in ACS) in combination with a second agent (ie,

and monitor closely. <90% or breathless. mortality in ACS) in unless contraindicated. for symptomatic

clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), unless contraindicated.

Nitrates (IV, topical, or sublingual) for symptomatic relief of angina unless contraindicated (eg, hypotension, sildenafil use within 24 hours). IV nitrates may be used with concomitant uncontrolled HTN or HF.

β-blockers should be given to all patients unless contraindicated (eg, HF, cardiogenic shock, bronchoconstriction) to reduce ischemia and mortality.

LMWH (eg, enoxaparin) or heparin drip to prevent clot formation in the coronary arteries.

Interventions: Immediate invasive strategy: Immediate coronary angiography for patients who have

signs of refractory angina, hemodynamic instability (HF or worsening mitral regurgitation), or electrical instability (VT/VF).

Early invasive strategy: Coronary angiography within 24 hours for other high-risk patients.

Ischemia-guided strategy: For low-risk patients, optimal medical therapy, with coronary angiography only in patients who develop refractory or recurrent angina, or with hemodynamic instability.

Long-term treatment: Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and prasugrel or ticagrelor (also P2Y12 inhibitors, but superior to clopidogrel) should be considered for up to 12 months after angioplasty and stenting to prevent in-stent thrombosis.

Ensure patient is on long-term β-blockers (if depressed LV function), ACEIs/ARBs, and high-intensity statins.

Address modifiable risk factors (ie, smoking, HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes).

ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

ST-segment elevations and cardiac enzyme release secondary to prolonged cardiac ischemia and necrosis. STEMI is a common medical emergency, and prompt treatment is absolutely necessary.

History/PE Presentation: Acute-onset substernal chest pain (>10–30 min), commonly described as a pressure, tightness, or heaviness that can radiate to the left arm, shoulders, neck, or jaw. May present without chest pain (“silent” infarct).

substernal chest pain (>10-30 that can radiate to the (“silent” infarct). (most common nausea/vomiting, (cardiogenic

Associated symptoms: Diaphoresis (most common associated symptom), shortness of breath, lightheadedness, anxiety, nausea/vomiting, epigastric pain (more common in women), and syncope.

PE: May reveal arrhythmias, hypotension (cardiogenic shock), new S4, pansystolic murmur, and evidence of new CHF. Clear lung fields are seen in RV MI (inferior MI). In a young, otherwise healthy person, consider cocaine use as the etiology.

Best predictor of survival: LVEF.

KEY FACT

It is important to check for aortic dissection clinically prior to administering anticoagulants or thrombolytics. Aortic dissection chest pain will be a tearing pain that radiates to the back along with unequal radial pulses. Initial test to assess for dissection includes a CXR, which may reveal widened mediastinum.

Diagnosis ECG: ST-segment elevations, hyperacute (tall) T waves, or new LBBB within hours (see Sgarbossa criteria in Electrocardiogram section). ST-segment depressions and dominant R waves in leads V1–V2 can also be a reciprocal change indicating posterior wall infarct. T- wave inversion and pathologic Q waves develop within hours to days.

Sequence of ECG changes: Peaked T waves → ST-segment elevation → Q waves → T-wave inversion → ST-segment normalization → T-wave normalization over several hours to days. Figure 2.1-4 illustrates these ECG changes over time.
======================================
Cardiac Enzymes:

Troponin (T and I) is the most sensitive and specific cardiac marker. CK-MB and the CK-MB/total CK ratio (CK index) are also regularly checked.

Differential diagnosis: Angina, myocarditis, pericarditis, aortic dissection, PE, esophageal reflux/spasm. These presentations are discussed in the stable angina differential diagnosis section.

Treatment Best initial treatment: An overview of the initial management of STEMI is provided in Figure 2.1-17. First line: Antiplatelet therapy; ASA (↓ mortality in ACS) + P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor if PCI planned [superior to clopidogrel]; if undergoing fibrinolysis, clopidogrel is used [prasugrel/ticagrelor relatively contraindicated]).

Nitrates (IV, topical, or sublingual): For symptomatic relief of angina unless contraindicated (eg, hypotension, sildenafil used within 24 hours). IV nitrates may be used with concomitant uncontrolled HTN or HF.

If SaO2 <90% to 92%, breathless, or in acute LVF, administer O2. β-blockers should be given to all patients unless contraindicated (eg, HF, cardiogenic

shock, bronchoconstriction) to reduce ischemia and mortality.

If the patient is in HF or in cardiogenic shock, do not give β-blockers. Consider ACEIs in HF provided that the patient is not hypotensive.

In inferior wall MI (ie, RV infarction), avoid nitrates and diuretics due to risk for severe hypotension (preload dependent). IV fluids can improve hemodynamics by increasing preload.

Summary of ACS medical management: UA: No ST elevation; cardia biomarkers ⊖. Tx: Aspirin. NSTEMI: No ST elevation; cardiac biomarkers ⊕. Tx: Aspirin, clopidogrel/ticagrelor, and

LMWH or heparin drip.

For both UA and NSTEMI: Tx: Nitrates and β-blockers if not hypotensive. STEMI: ST elevation; cardiac biomarkers ⊕. Tx: Angioplasty with stent placement.

Interventions: Emergent angiography and PCI should be performed if possible (superior to

thrombolysis).

If PCI cannot be performed <120 minutes (door-to-balloon time should ideally be <90 minutes), and there are no contraindications to thrombolysis, thrombolysis with alteplase (tPA), reteplase, or streptokinase should be performed instead of PCI.

Although thrombolysis should be performed within 3 hours of chest pain onset, it can be used up to 12 hours from the onset of symptoms (mortality benefit extends to 12 hours). Thrombolysis is contraindicated if >24 hours.
======================================
KEY FACT

Contraindications to thrombolysis: Previous intracranial hemorrhage or major GI bleed. Recent major trauma/surgery/head injury. Ischemic stroke within the last 6 months. Severe hypertension (>180/110 mm Hg). Known bleeding disorder.

or major GI bleed. injury. months. mm Hg).

Long-term treatment: Long-term management for all patients includes ASA, ACEIs, β-blockers, nitrates, and

high-dose statins.

After PCI is performed, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker, eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) is necessary:

If bare metal stent is placed, >30 days of dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary. If drug-eluting stent is placed, >12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary.

Address modifiable risk factors (eg, smoking, HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes).

KEY FACT

Indications for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG): Left main CAD. Triple-vessel disease with ≥70% in each vessel. Two-vessel disease in diabetic patient. Symptomatic patient despite maximal medical therapy. Coronary obstruction not amenable to PCI.

Complications Arrhythmia: VF and VT are the most common complications and the most common

causes of sudden death after acute MI. Sinus bradycardia and third-degree (complete) heart block are also very common.

Less common complications include reinfarction, LV wall rupture, VSD, pericarditis, papillary muscle rupture (with mitral regurgitation), LV aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, and mural thrombi (with subsequent acute limb ischemia, TIA, or stroke).

Complications noted earlier tend to occur at different times in the course of this disease. This is detailed in Table 2.1-16.

RV infarction: Caused by occlusion of the RCA. Presents with hypotension, JVD, and clear lungs. Treat with revascularization and volume replacement (preload dependent). Avoid nitrates and diuretics.
======================================
KEY FACT

RV MI is caused by occlusion of the RCA. As dysfunctional RV is dependent on preload to maintain stroke volume, preload-reducing drugs (nitrates and diuretics) can cause severe hypotension and must be avoided. In RV MI with shock, treat with IV fluids to optimize preload, and add inotropes if necessary.

CAROTID ARTERY STENOSIS

Atherosclerotic lesion of either or both carotid arteries. Accounts for 20% of TIAs and embolic strokes.

History/PE Often asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease is characterized by sudden-onset focal neurologic defect in the past 6

months (ie, TIA or stroke).

PE may reveal carotid artery bruit. Risk factors: Advanced age, smoking, HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and family

history of CAD and/or carotid artery disease.

Diagnosis Duplex ultrasonography can determine percent occlusion.

Treatment Definitive treatment: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Carotid stenting in some select

cases.

CEA recommended in symptomatic (TIA/stroke in last 6 months) patients with 70% to 99% stenosis.

patient factors (eg, age, with 50% to 69% or stenting is contraindicated occluded vessel).

Based on procedural risk and patient factors (eg, age, sex, comorbidities, life expectancy), consider in symptomatic patients with 50% to 69% or asymptomatic with 60% to 99% stenosis.

With 100% blockage, CEA or stenting is contraindicated (there can be no thromboembolism from a completely occluded vessel).

DYSLIPIDEMIA

Increased total cholesterol, LDL-C, or triglyceride levels or decreased HDL levels. Although these are all risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD; ie, CAD, stroke), LDL-C is the dominant atherogenic cholesterol.

Dyslipidemia may be due to primary (genetic conditions such as familial combined hypercholesterolemia or familial hypertriglyceridemia) or secondary causes.

Secondary causes include DM, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal disease, hypothyroidism, obesity, cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and certain medications (eg, thiazide diuretics, β-blockers, oral contraceptive pills [OCPs], clozapine). Optimizing treatment of secondary causes is indicated in all patients.

History/PE Most patients have no specific signs or symptoms. Patients with extremely high triglyceride or LDL levels may have xanthomata (eruptive itchy nodules, orange streaks in palmar creases, or tuberous plaques on the elbows and knees); xanthelasma (yellow fatty deposits in the skin around the lids just below the eyes); lipemia retinalis (creamy appearance of retinal vessels); or corneal arcus (deposition of lipid in the corneal stroma).

Patients with very high triglyceride levels (>500 mg/dL) may initially present with

pancreatitis.

Patients may have a history of primary familial hyperlipidemias.
======================================
KEY FACT

Causes of secondary hyperlipidemia include Cushing syndrome, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and cholestasis.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Lipid profile may show ↑ total cholesterol, ↑ LDL-C, ↑ triglycerides, or ↓

HDL.

Indications for testing: Screen all patients >35 years of age or those ≥20 years of age with risk factors for ASCVD and repeat every 5 years or sooner if lipid levels are elevated. Additionally, smokers of all ages should be screened for dyslipidemias due to their ↑ risk. Interpretation of results:

Risk of ASCVD: 10-year risk of ASCVD, estimated using the Pooled Cohort Equations tool, directs further treatment.

Individuals with LDL >190 mg/dL, triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL, family history of premature atherosclerotic disease, or physical signs of dyslipidemia (eg, tendon xanthoma) should also be evaluated for primary causes of hyperlipidemia.

ASCVD.risk on the risk (young, healthy)

KEY FACT

As you cannot calculate the patient’s ASCVD risk on the USMLE, focus on obvious signs of ↑ risk (smoking, diabetes) or ↓ risk (young, healthy) when deciding if statin therapy is appropriate.

Treatment Elevated LDL-C: Lowering LDL-C may reduce the risk of ASCVD. Lifestyle therapies: Dietary modification (eg, low fat, reduced red meat, increased fiber),

aerobic exercise, and weight loss are recommended in all patients.

Indications for pharmacotherapy: The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations are presented in Table 2.1-17.

Intensity of therapy: Medication regimen varies based on the goal LDL reduction. High-intensity statin therapy (eg, atorvastatin 40 and 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg) reduces LDL-C >50%, while moderate-intensity therapy lowers LDL-C by 30%– 50%.

Elevated triglycerides: Initial treatment: Lifestyle therapies (diet, exercise, weight loss), treatment of secondary

causes (eg, optimization of chronic kidney disease [CKD] or diabetes therapy), and avoidance of medications that may cause hypertriglyceridemia.

If ASCVD risk ≥7.5% after initial treatment, statins may be considered. Prevention of pancreatitis: Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (especially triglycerides ≥1000 mg/dL) benefit from fibrate therapy to prevent pancreatitis.

HYPERTENSION

HTN is the most common disease in the United States and the key risk factor in MI and stroke. Stage 1 HTN is defined as an SBP ≥130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥80 to 89 mm Hg. Measurements are based on an average of ≥2 readings obtained on ≥2 occasions separated in time in adults (see Table 2.1-19 for classifications). HTN is classified as primary or essential without an identifiable cause and secondary when an identifiable cause exists.

Diagnosis Measurement: Never diagnose HTN on one reading unless severe HTN or end-organ

damage is present. Measurements are based on an average of ≥2 readings obtained on ≥2 occasions separated in time (days, weeks) in adults. Ambulatory BP monitoring is the gold standard. Ambulatory BP and outpatient BP (with home BP monitors) monitoring help exclude white coat hypertension (elevated BP only in clinic) as a cause of HTN. Serial clinic BP checks can also be used.

New-onset HTN: Once primary HTN is diagnosed, the next best step is to screen for complications and comorbid conditions, which include HbA1c or fasting glucose, lipid panel, chemistry panel (serum Cr, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], K), ECG (screen for LV hypertrophy, Q waves for previous MI), and a urinalysis (protein).

Secondary cause of HTN: If suspected, order appropriate tests (see secondary HTN key fact).

Treatment Best initial treatment: Lifestyle modifications listed in order of effectiveness: Weight loss (in overweight people) > DASH diet > exercise > restricting salt intake > alcohol limitation (if patient has refractory HTN, limiting alcohol may be the answer). Depending on patient, usually tried for 3 to 6 months before drugs are considered.

Best initial medications: Choice of thiazide diuretics (usually), ACEs/ARBs, or dihydropyridine CCBs unless a compelling indication exists (Tables 2.1-20 and 2.1-21).

A patient is diagnosed with new-onset primary HTN. The physician recommends lifestyle modifications with a focus on weight loss, with follow-up scheduled 3 months later to evaluate the need for medications. What is the next best step in evaluating this patient?

Once primary HTN is diagnosed, the next best step is to screen for complications and comorbid conditions, which include HbA1c or fasting glucose, lipid panel, chemistry panel (serum Cr, BUN, K), ECG (screen for LV hypertrophy, Q waves for previous MI), and a urinalysis (protein).

SECONDARY HYPERTENSION

HTN that occurs secondary to an identifiable cause (see Table 2.1-22). Identifiable causes of HTN account for a minority (~5%) of cases. Patients should be worked up for secondary causes of HTN if they are younger (age <35), have a severely elevated or refractory-to- treatment BP, or a specific sign indicating a secondary cause.

HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY/URGENCY

Presentation The features of severe HTN, hypertensive urgency, and emergency are compared in Table 2.1-23.

TABLE 2.1-23. Presentation of Hypertensive Urgency and Emergency

A

CONDITION DEFINITION Severe hypertension SBP >180 or DBP >120 mm Hg Hypertensive urgency Severe hypertension + no end-organ damage* (perhaps mild headache) Hypertensive emergency Severe hypertension + end-organ damage® ® End-organ damage is defined as any of the following manifestations: = CNS: Encephalopathy (confusion), stroke, retinal hemorrhage (blurry vision), T intracerebral pressure (papilledema). ® Cardiovascular: Acute coronary syndromes, angina, dyspnea, heart failure, aortic dissection, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) (endothelial injury > thrombus — MAHA; mostly historical). « Key pathologic finding: Hyperplastic arteriosclerosis — widespread ischemia. = Renal: Acute kidney injury, hematuria, proteinuria.

Treatment Goal: A 25% reduction in BP from baseline or <160/100 mm Hg for both hypertensive urgency and emergency. Medications: eg, labetalol, captopril. Hypertensive urgency: Lower to goal within 24 hours with oral medications. Hypertensive emergency: ↓ mean arterial pressure (MAP) by ~20% within first hour, not exceeding 25% in 24 hours. Do NOT lower too quickly or to normal BP, as autoregulation of BP cannot adjust quickly enough → ischemia (eg, stroke, MI). Classically occurs in a patient with long-standing HTN who stops medications.

arterial pressure NOT lower too quickly — ischemia (eg, who stops-medications. medication can proper’dosing of it to esmolol), CCBs (clevidipine

Medications: Any IV antihypertensive medication can be acceptable, as the specific drug available is not as important as proper dosing of it to manage BP to goal. Drugs commonly used: β-blockers (labetalol or esmolol), CCBs (clevidipine or nicardipine), D1 agonist (fenoldopam), hydralazine, enalapril, nitroprusside (prolonged use → cyanide poisoning → inhibition of electron transport chain [ETC] → severe lactic acidosis).
======================================
KEY FACT

Hypertensive emergency is diagnosed based on the presence of hypertension-induced end- organ damage, NOT a specific BP measurement. Generally, however, severe hypertension has an SBP >180 mm Hg or DBP >120 mm Hg present.

KEY FACT

Cyanide poisoning classically presents with hypertensive emergency after nitroprusside therapy with altered mental status + widespread features of tissue hypoxia. Immediately initiate antidote(s): Hydroxocobalamin (first-line) Sodium thiosulfate (coadminister with hydroxocobalamin) Sodium or amyl nitrate

Q

A 20-year-old man presents with an initial BP of 150/85 mm Hg, and repeat measurement yields 147/85 mm Hg. The patient’s potassium level is 3.2 mg/dL. What is the next best diagnostic step?

PERICARDIAL DISEASE

The pericardium is a fibroelastic sac made up of visceral and parietal layers separated by a potential space, the pericardial cavity. In healthy individuals, the pericardial cavity contains 30 to 50 mL of an ultrafiltrate of plasma.

Diseases of the pericardium present as acute pericarditis, constrictive pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade.

ACUTE PERICARDITIS

Acute pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardial sac. It may be either the first manifestation of an underlying systemic disease or represent an isolated process. Etiologies include:

likely etiology systemic lupus erythematosus MI.oras a delayed

Idiopathic Infectious (most common infection, likely etiology Coxsackie B virus, Staphylococcus,

Streptococcus, tuberculosis [TB])

Connective tissue disorder (ie, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis, Goodpasture syndrome)

Post-MI (either within days after MI or as a delayed phenomenon, ie, Dressler syndrome) Uremia Neoplasms Drugs Radiation Trauma or open heart surgery (Fig. 2.1-24).

A rare case of cardiac tamponade induced by chronic rheumatoid arthritis. J Clin Med Res. 2015;7[9]:720–723. doi:10.14740/jocmr2226w.)

Acute pericarditis can compromise cardiac output via tamponade (extravasation of large amounts of fluid secondary to pericarditis) or constrictive pericarditis (chronic pericarditis).

History/PE Presentation: Sharp pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, cough, and fever. Key feature: Chest pain tends to worsen in the supine position and with inspiration. Classically, patient is seen sitting up (pain improves in prone position) and bending forward.

Exam: May reveal a pericardial friction rub. Elevated JVP, tachycardia, muffled S1 and S2, and pulsus paradoxus (↓ in SBP >10 mm Hg on inspiration) can be present with pericardial tamponade. Kussmaul sign can be present with constrictive pericarditis.
======================================
Diagnosis ECG:

Stage 1: Diffuse ST-segment elevation (concave or saddle shaped) and PR-segment

depressions.

Stage 2: Normalization of ST segment and PR-segment changes. Stage 3: Development of diffuse T-wave inversions (Fig. 2.1-25). Typically seen after

ST segment becomes iso-electric.

a pericardial effusion. serum aldosterone and

Stage 4: Normalization of ECG.

CXR: Cardiomegaly may indicate a pericardial effusion.

A hyperaldosteronism workup with serum aldosterone and renin levels is an appropriate next best diagnostic step.

KEY FACT

Pericardial calcification seen on CXR strongly suggests constrictive pericarditis due to chronic fibrosis and calcification of the pericardium.

Blood tests: Full blood count (FBC), ESR, urea and electrolytes (U&Es), cardiac enzymes (troponin may be raised), viral serology, and if indicated, autoantibodies, fungal precipitins, and thyroid function tests (TFTs).

Echo: Pericardial thickening or effusion may be evident.

KEY FACT

ST-segment elevations in pericarditis are differentiated from MI in that they are not localized to one region of the heart; widespread ST-segment elevations are seen.

Treatment Goal of treatment is pain relief, resolution of inflammation, and prevention of recurrence.

A

Activity restriction: Patients should be instructed to restrict strenuous physical activity until symptoms have resolved and biomarkers have normalized.

NSAIDs + colchicine: For patients with idiopathic or viral pericarditis. Glucocorticoids should be used for initial treatment of acute pericarditis only in patients with contraindications to NSAIDs or for specific indications (SLE, renal failure). Avoid corticosteroids within a few days after MI, as they can predispose to ventricular wall rupture.

For patients in whom etiology for pericarditis is known, specific treatment for the underlying cause is indicated (dialysis in uremia, ASA for post-MI pericarditis, corticosteroids/immunosuppression for SLE-related pericarditis).

When acute symptoms are resolved, NSAIDs are tapered weekly to reduce recurrence rate, and colchicine is used for a total duration of 3 months.
======================================
KEY FACT

Consider uremic pericarditis in a patient with end-stage renal disease and azotemia. It is characterized by prominent fibrin deposition but no epicardial inflammation; thus classical ECG changes (diffuse ST elevation, PR depression) are not seen. Treatment is with hemodialysis.

of scarring and’ is chronic in nature. fluid overload (edema

CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS

Constrictive pericarditis is the result of scarring and consequent loss of the normal elasticity of the pericardial sac. Typically, it is chronic in nature.

History/PE Presents with symptoms suggesting fluid overload (edema of lower limbs and ascites) and

low cardiac output (fatiguability and dyspnea on exertion).

Clinical exam: JVD, hepatosplenomegaly, Kussmaul sign, and pericardial knock (produced from heart hitting the calcified pericardium in diastole).

Diagnosis Echocardiography: Should see septal bounce, respiratory septal shift, pericardial

thickening, and a decrease in ventricular filling flow during inspiration.

CXR: May show calcifications around the cardiac silhouette. CT scan shows thickened pericardium. ECG may show low-voltage complexes.

Treatment Diuretics to control edema and ascites. Medical management with NSAIDs and colchicine if features are mild. Pericardial stripping (ie, surgical removal of the pericardium) is the definitive

management. Performed if patient fails medical management or if he or she has severe symptoms.
======================================
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION

Pericardial effusion is characterized by an increased amount of fluid in the pericardial cavity. Many patients with pericardial effusion are asymptomatic, and the effusion is detected incidentally. Common causes include idiopathic (most common), malignancy, infections, autoimmune disease, hypothyroidism, ascending aortic dissection, anticoagulants, and medication. In countries where TB is endemic, more than 60% of effusions are due to TB.

History/PE Patient may present with signs suggestive of acute pericarditis. Important to obtain history for recent illnesses, malignancy, history of TB and vaccination

status, autoimmune disorders, history of CKD or renal failure, or history of CHF, hypothyroidism, or liver disease.

Physical exam may show muffled/distant heart sounds. Ewart sign/dullness to percussion at the base of the left inferior scapular border in

conjunction with tubular breath sounds and egophony.

Diagnosis CXR may show an enlarged, globular, water bottle–shaped heart with a large effusion

(Fig. 2.1-26).

FIGURE 2.1-26. Pericardial effusion. Water bottle–shaped heart seen on CXR with pericardial effusion. (Reproduced with permission from Chen MY et al. Basic Radiology, 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

Cardiac echo may show increased fluid in pericardial space. On CT imaging, pericardial effusion is diagnosed when the pericardial space is >3 to 4 mm in diameter (a normal pericardial space has 30–50 mL of fluid and is equal to or less than 2 mm in diameter).

If present on ECG, electrical alternans (due to swinging motion of heart in fluid filled cavity) is diagnostic of a large pericardial effusion (Fig. 2.1-27).

FIGURE 2.1-27. Electrical alternans, where voltage of QRS changes with each beat. If seen, diagnostic of pericardial effusion. (Modified with permission from Maharaj SS, Chang SM. Cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus: A case report and review of the literature. Pediatr Rheumatol Online J. 2015;13:9. doi: 10.1186/s12969-015-0005-0.)

Treatment Treatment focused on the cause of the disease. In patients with pericardial effusion of unknown cause and elevated inflammatory

markers, empiric treatment for pericarditis is reasonable.

If cancer or bacterial infection is suspected, pericardiocentesis with or without a pericardial biopsy is recommended.

If idiopathic effusions are present for more than 3 months, pericardial drainage should be considered, as the likelihood to convert into cardiac tamponade is high in these individuals.

In patients with symptoms suggestive of cardiac tamponade, immediate pericardial drainage is advised (Cardiac Tamponade section to follow).
======================================
CARDIAC TAMPONADE

Excess fluid in the pericardial sac ↑ the intrapericardial pressure, leading to compromised ventricular filling and ↓ cardiac output. The rate of fluid formation is more important than the size of the effusion. Risk factors include pericarditis, malignancy, SLE, TB, and trauma (commonly stab wounds medial to the left nipple).

History/PE Presents with fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety, tachycardia, and tachypnea that can rapidly

progress to shock and death.

Exam of a patient with acute tamponade may reveal Beck triad (hypotension, distant or muffled S1 and S2 heart sounds, and JVD), a narrow pulse pressure, and pulsus paradoxus.

Lung fields are clear on exam (high yield and frequently tested in CK).

Diagnosis Echo is diagnostic and shows right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse and echo-

free zone around the heart.

Right heart catheterization will show equalization of all the pressures (RA, RV, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]) in the heart during diastole.

KEY FACT

Beck triad can diagnose acute cardiac tamponade: JVD Hypotension Distant heart sounds

Treatment Aggressive volume expansion with IV fluids. Urgent pericardiocentesis (aspirate will be nonclotting blood) with a pericardial drain.

Send fluid to lab analysis to determine etiology.

If significant drainage continues for more than 3 to 4 days or if effusions are recurrent, a pericardial window should be considered.

ENDOCARDITIS

Endocarditis is inflammation of the endocardium, the inner layer of the heart overlying the valves. It has noninfective (NBTE) and infective (bacteria/fungi) causes. Infective endocarditis (IE) is the consequence of bacteremia (dental procedures, injections, surgery) and usually causes tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valve lesions, resulting in regurgitation. Acute IE occurs over hours to days, whereas subacute IE progresses over weeks to months. Causes are discussed in Table 2.1-24.

Aggregatibacter paraphrophilus); Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (subsequently called Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans); Cardiobacterium hominis; Eikenella corrodens; and Kingella kingae.

Candida + Aspergillus fumigatus: Most common causes of fungal endocarditis typically in immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS, transplant), IV drug use (IVDUs), long- term IV catheter use.

Culture negative IE: Most common manifestation of chronic Q fever (Coxiella burnetii). Bartonella quintana Gram ⊖ rod → lice spread → individuals with poor hygeine.

History/PE IE should be suspected in any patient with unexplained fever(s) ± bacteremia and a new regurgitant heart murmur of the tricuspid, mitral, or aortic valve. Fulminant HF due to severe regurgitant lesions may also occur.

Septic emboli: Coronary artery (MI), brain (stroke), spinal cord (paralysis), eye (blindness), extremities (septic arthritis), splenic/renal infarctions, PE (from tricuspid lesions), mycotic aneurysm, abscesses, Janeway lesions (painless erythematous microabscesses on palms/soles).

Immune phenomena: Eyes (Roth spots = oval red retinal lesions with clear/pale center; see Fig. 2.1-28B), glomerulus (signs/symptoms of glomerulonephritis), Osler nodes (painful/raised lesions on digits/feet; “Ouchler nodes,” see Fig. 2.1-28C), splinter hemorrhages (vasculitis underneath fingernails that follows direction of growth, see Fig. 2.1-28D), rheumatoid factor.

Paravalvular abscess: Persistent fever + bacteremia despite treatment → paravalvular abscess formation. Notably, paravalvular abscess of aortic valve → new-onset AV block on ECG.

Treatment General guidelines: At least two, preferably three, sets of blood cultures should be drawn prior to initiating antibiotics, generally even in acutely ill patients. If empiric antibiotics are given for native or prosthetic valve endocarditis, the best initial treatment is vancomycin ± gentamicin or another antibiotic. Blood culture results are used to tailor therapy. Antibiotics are delivered parenterally for 4 to 6 weeks for left-sided lesions and 2 weeks for right-sided lesions, and are targeted toward the specific microorganism (Table 2.1-26).

VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

Subtypes of valvular heart disease appear in Table 2.1-28 along with their specific etiologies, presentations, diagnoses, and treatments. Overarching high-yield concepts for all valvular diseases are briefly presented.

Identification: Murmur descriptions are usually the most specific identifiers in questions. Right-sided murmurs increase in intensity with inhalation (like sipping a straw, this increases venous return), whereas left-sided murmurs decrease with inhalation. Exhalation is the exact opposite.

Rheumatic heart disease can cause any valvular disease. Mitral stenosis is most common. Best initial test: Echocardiogram. TTE is less invasive; TEE is more sensitive/specific. Most accurate test: Cardiac catheterization, which measures valvular diameters and

=

pressure gradients.

Not ECG/x-ray: Often listed as answer distractions. Both can indicate chamber enlargement.
======================================
Broad treatment guidelines: Endocarditis prophylaxis is only for replaced valves or valves with previous

endocarditis.

Diuretics are helpful for fluid overload that can occur in all forms of valvular heart

diseases.

Surgery is indicated only for symptomatic + severe valvular disease. Severe stenotic lesions are treated with surgery to restore functional anatomy. Severe regurgitant lesions can initially be treated with vasodilators to decrease afterload and encourage forward blood flow. Surgery is done prior to significant dilatation of the heart.

KEY FACT

Mitral regurgitation classically occurs secondary to posteromedial papillary muscle rupture 2 to 7 days after a posterior descending coronary artery MI due to its singular blood supply. Conversely, anterolateral papillary muscle rupture is 6 to12 times less likely due to its dual blood supply from the left anterior descending + left circumflex arteries.

KEY FACT

Many cardiovascular conditions have an increased risk during pregnancy. For example, pregnancy is not advised with severe obstructive valvular lesions (mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis), symptomatic HF with EF <30%, unstable/dilated aorta (eg, Marfan syndrome), and pulmonary HTN.

VASCULAR DISEASES  AORTIC ANEURYSM 

Greater than 50% dilation of all three layers of the aortic wall. Aortic aneurysms are most commonly associated with atherosclerosis. Most are abdominal, and >90% originate below the renal arteries. Etiologies: Degeneration (atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia), infection (syphilis), trauma, inflammation (Takayasu), connective tissue diseases (Marfans, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), and congenital (Turner syndrome, tuberous sclerosis)

Ascending aortic aneurysm—think cystic medial necrosis or connective tissue disease Descending aortic aneurysm—think atherosclerosis

Complications: Rupture, thrombosis, embolism, fistulae, pressure on surrounding structures

History/PE Usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on exam or radiologic study. It may

cause mild abdominal or back pain. Less frequently, those with symptomatic but unruptured aneurysms may present with signs of limb ischemia (acute or chronic) or systemic symptoms (fever, malaise).

Exam can demonstrate a pulsatile abdominal mass or abdominal bruits. Risk factors include HTN, high cholesterol, other vascular disease, a ⊕ family history,

smoking (strongest predictor of rupture), gender (males > females), and age.

Ruptured aneurysm leads to hypotension and severe, tearing abdominal pain that radiates to the back, iliac fossae, or groin and syncope.
======================================
KEY FACT

AAA is generally defined as abdominal aortic dilation in adults >3.0 cm.

Diagnosis Screening: All men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking are recommended for

a one-time screening by ultrasound for AAA (Fig. 2.1-29). Figure 2.1-30 suggests an algorithm for the diagnosis and initial management of AAA.

Abdominal ultrasound is used for diagnosis or to follow the course of an aneurysm over

time.

Q

A 70-year-old man with HTN presents for a routine appointment. He quit smoking 20 years ago but has a 20-pack-year history. What screening, if any, is indicated?

CT with contrast or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be useful to determine the precise anatomy.

KEY FACT

Size of AAA determines treatment: <5 cm → monitoring >5 cm → surgical correction

Treatment In asymptomatic patients, monitoring is appropriate for lesions Surgical or endovascular correction is indicated if the lesion is ≥5.5 cm (abdominal), >6

cm (thoracic), or smaller but rapidly enlarging (watch for bowel ischemia and infarction).

rapidly enlarging (watch or ruptured aneurysms. are defined as >5 mm

Emergent surgery for symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms.
======================================
KEY FACT

Rapidly expanding aortic aneurysms are defined as >5 mm increase in size in 6 months or >10 mm increase in size in 12 months.

AORTIC DISSECTION

A transverse tear in the intima of a vessel that results in blood entering the media, creating a false lumen and leading to a hematoma that propagates longitudinally. Most commonly secondary to HTN, but also due to blunt chest trauma. The most common sites of origin are above the aortic valve and distal to the left subclavian artery. Most often occurs at 40 to 60 years of age, with a greater frequency in males than in females.

KEY FACT

Aortic aneurysm is most often associated with atherosclerosis, whereas aortic dissection is commonly linked to HTN.

History/PE History: HTN, Marfan syndrome, mitral valve prolapse, trauma Presentation: Sudden tearing/ripping pain in the anterior chest (ascending) with or

without radiation to the back (descending), typically between the scapulae

PE:

Patients are typically hypertensive. If hypotensive, consider pericardial tamponade, hypovolemia from blood loss, or other cardiopulmonary etiologies.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend one- time screening for AAA by ultrasound in men 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked.

Asymmetric pulses and BP measurements or acute limb ischemia. A murmur of aortic regurgitation may be heard if the aortic valve is involved with a

proximal dissection.

Neurologic deficits, such as paraplegia, may be seen if the aortic arch or spinal arteries are involved.

Anuria may be seen if renal arteries are involved. Signs of pericarditis or pericardial tamponade may be seen.

Diagnosis Aortic dissection suspected based on history and physical exam findings. Best initial test for hemodynamically stable patients: CT angiography. MRA can be

used if contrast CT is contraindicated.

TEE. Visualization of an intimal flap as well as a false lumen is diagnostic. It may also be used to visualize details of the proximal aorta and coronary vessels and can also evaluate for pericardial effusion.

The Stanford system classifies any dissection proximal to the left subclavian artery as type A and all others as type B (Fig. 2.1-31).

Type A (~70%) is the most common and involves the ascending aorta, irrespective of the site of the tear. Type B does not involve the ascending aorta.

KEY FACT

Ascending aortic dissections are surgical emergencies; descending dissections are still emergencies but can often be treated medically.

Treatment BP control: Important to monitor and medically manage BP and heart rate as necessary. Avoid thrombolytics. Begin IV β-blockers (eg, IV labetalol) before starting vasodilators (nitroprusside) to prevent reflex tachycardia. BP goals in the management of aortic dissection aim to decrease shear stress on the dissection, but maintain adequate organ perfusion with systolic blood pressure of 100 to 120 mm Hg. Heart rate goal is <60 bpm. All patients with type A thoracic dissection (ascending dissections) should have surgery. Patients with type B thoracic dissection (descending dissections) may be managed

medically with BP and heart rate control; surgery is reserved if there is a leakage, rupture, or compromised organs.

DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS

Clot formation in the large veins of the extremities or pelvis. The classic Virchow triad of risk factors includes venous stasis (eg, from long-haul flights, prolonged bed rest, obesity, immobility, or incompetent venous valves in the lower extremities), endothelial trauma (eg, surgery, injury to the lower extremities, IV catheters, trauma), and hypercoagulable states (eg, thrombophilia, malignancy, pregnancy, OCP use, hyperhomocysteinemia). A common scoring system for determining the likelihood of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT)—the Wells’ DVT Criteria—guides management of a patient with suspected DVT (Table 2.1-28).
======================================
TABLE 2.1-28. Wells’ DVT Criteriaa

KEY FACT

Virchow triad: (1) venous stasis, (2) trauma (endothelial damage), (3) hypercoagulability

History/PE Presents with unilateral lower extremity pain and swelling. Calf warmth, tenderness, and

erythema may be present.

Homans sign is calf tenderness with passive foot dorsiflexion (poor sensitivity and specificity for DVT).

Use pretest clinical probability scoring for DVT, the Wells’ score. May see phlegmasia alba dolens or phlegmasia cerulea dolens (see Fig. 2.1.33) in more

severe cases.

FIGURE 2.1-33. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens. (Adapted with permission from Hu H, Cai Y, Wang C, et al. Successful treatment of posttraumatic phlegmasia cerulea dolens by reconstructing the external iliac vein: a case report. J Med Case Rep. 2014;8:149 doi:10.1186/1752-1947-8-149)

Important differential diagnosis includes Baker cyst, muscle strain/tear/twisting injury to leg, cellulitis, edema secondary to infection, and varicose veins.

KEY FACT

Phlegmasia alba dolens (literally, “edema, pain, and white, blanching skin”) is a PE finding sometimes seen in acute DVT. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (“edema, pain, and blue skin”) is a more severe form of phlegmasia alba dolens, where the skin turns blue as the DVT progressively worsens (Fig. 2.1-33).

======================================
FIGURE 2.1-34. Management of suspected DVT based on Wells’ score. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

KEY FACT

D-dimer is sensitive but not specific for DVT (elevated in many other clinical situations

such as infection, malignancy, pregnancy, and postoperative states, to name a few). Therefore a ⊖ D-dimer test can be used to rule out the possibility of VTE in low-risk

patients.

Treatment Anticoagulate with subcutaneous LMWH, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), or IV

unfractionated heparin followed by oral warfarin or DOACs for a total of 3 months (total duration dependent on cause, number of occurrences, and bleeding risk).

First-occurrence unprovoked DVT or provoked DVT by a reversible risk factor is unlikely to recur and only requires 3 months of anticoagulation treatment.

DVT secondary to cancer or a second unprovoked DVT is likely to recur and requires indefinite anticoagulation treatment (extended therapy).

In patients with contraindications for anticoagulation, inferior vena cava filters should be placed.

Hospitalized patients should receive DVT prophylaxis consisting of exercise as tolerated, antithromboembolic stockings, and subcutaneous LMWH or unfractionated heparin.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis is sometimes used as an adjunct to anticoagulation in order to help prevent postthrombotic (postphlebitis) syndrome in patients with low bleeding risk who have a decent life expectancy.

(no scheduled stop date) cause of DVT; those who should receive scheduled risks/benefits’of continuing

KEY FACT

Extended anticoagulation therapy (no scheduled stop date) for the treatment of DVT is based on bleeding risk and underlying cause of DVT; those who are at low risk of bleeding may be candidates for extended therapy and should receive scheduled (eg, annual) reassessments of risk of bleeding to reassess risks/benefits of continuing therapy.

KEY FACT

Provoked DVT: DVT thought to be caused by an identifiable risk factor such as a recent hospital admission/surgery, beginning estrogen therapy, pregnancy, a long flight, etc. Unprovoked DVT: No known identifiable cause; possibly due to hereditary factors.
======================================
POSTTHROMBOTIC (POSTPHLEBITIC) SYNDROME

Chronic venous insufficiency that develops after a patient has a DVT, which develops into sometimes severe symptoms that impair quality of life. Thought to be due to long-standing venous hypertension from a combination of venous valvular incompetence leading to reflux and thrombotic obstruction.

Risk factors: Preexisting venous insufficiency, old age, obesity, varicose veins, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, symptomatic DVT, iliofemoral (proximal) DVT, and residual thrombus within the first 6 months after thrombotic episode.

History/PE Extremity pain and sensation of “heaviness” Venous dilation

Skin pigmentation/phlegmasia, trophic skin changes/stasis dermatitis, venous ulcers (when

severe) Edema

Diagnosis Diagnosis is made clinically in patients with a history of DVT and obvious symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound can help identify underlying venous valvular insufficiency and residual clot burden, and blood tests can help elucidate potential underlying clotting disorders.

Treatment Conservative management (first line): exercise, compression therapy (compressive

stockings), skin care (eg, moisturizers for dry/pruritic skin)

Venous intervention (eg, endovascular catheter-directed thrombolysis, stenting, surgical correction of venous reflux) for acute clot

PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE

Defined as a restriction of the blood supply to the extremities by atherosclerotic plaque. The lower extremities are most commonly affected. Clinical manifestations depend on the vessels involved, the extent and rate of obstruction, and the presence of collateral blood flow.

presence claudication; reproducible distance(claudication critical limb ischemia. ulcerations may develop

History/PE Presents with intermittent claudication; reproducible cramping pain in the calf, thigh, or buttock after walking for a certain distance (claudication distance) and is relieved with rest.

As the disease progresses, it causes critical limb ischemia. Pain occurs at rest and affects the distal extremities. Dorsal foot ulcerations may develop secondary to poor perfusion. A painful, cold, numb foot is characteristic of critical limb ischemia (chronic limb- threatening ischemia).

For more proximal lesions, there will be claudication and weak pulses below the area of occlusion (ie, aortoiliac disease [Leriche syndrome] is characterized by the triad of hip, thigh, and buttock claudication; impotence; and symmetric atrophy of bilateral lower extremities).

Capillary filling of >15 seconds is seen in severe ischemia.
======================================
KEY FACT

Critical limb ischemia (chronic limb-threatening ischemia): Presence of PAD in combination with pain at rest, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration >2 weeks duration

Acute ischemia:

May be due to thrombosis in situ (most common), emboli (usually of cardiac origin),

graft/angioplasty occlusion, or trauma. Acute occlusions commonly occur at bifurcations distal to the last palpable pulse (see mnemonic for signs and symptoms). May also be secondary to cholesterol atheroembolism (“blue toe syndrome”), which is characterized by blue toes, livedo reticularis, and renal failure (often secondary to catheterization).

Chronic ischemia: Lack of blood perfusion leads to muscle atrophy, pallor, loss of sweat and sebaceous glands, cyanosis, hair loss, and gangrene/necrosis.

Best initial test: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) test (1–1.4 is normal); can provide objective evidence of atherosclerosis (≤0.9 is highly sensitive and specific for PAD, rest pain usually occurs with an ABI <0.4).

Doppler ultrasound: Identifies stenosis and occlusion. Normal ankle Doppler readings are >90% of brachial readings.

Most accurate test: Angiography (invasive); computed tomography angiography (CTA) with runoff (noninvasive); often not necessary unless revascularization is indicated.

KEY FACT

Calf claudication = femoral disease Buttock claudication = iliac disease Buttock claudication + impotence = Leriche syndrome (aortoiliac occlusive disease)

Treatment Treat acute symptomatic ischemia with heparin and prompt revascularization. Smoking cessation (vital); optimally treat HTN, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Educate regarding careful hygiene and foot care. Exercise helps develop collateral

circulation.

Antiplatelet agents (ASA or vorapaxar) do not consistently reduce symptoms but ↓ the risk for associated cardiovascular mortality.

Cilostazol is effective medication in intermittent claudication, although it is contraindicated in those with CHF.

Surgery (arterial bypass), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and stenting or

amputation can be employed when conservative treatment fails or in acute limb ischemia.
======================================
KEY FACT

The major cause of mortality in patients with PAD is cardiovascular disease (MI, stroke); there is a 20% to 30% risk for these complications. There is only a 1% to 2% risk for developing limb ischemia.

LYMPHEDEMA

A disruption of the lymphatic circulation that results in peripheral edema and chronic infection of the extremities. Primary (or congenital) lymphedema is rare. Most often caused secondarily by surgeries involving lymph node dissection or, in developing countries, parasitic infections.

History/PE History will differ by cause. Examples include the following: Postmastectomy patients present with unexplained swelling of the upper extremity

(secondary to surgery).

Patients originating from developing countries present with progressive swelling of the lower extremities bilaterally with no cardiac abnormalities (ie, filariasis infection).

Children present with progressive, bilateral swelling of the extremities (primary). Patients with Turner syndrome will have lymphatic edema.

======================================
SYNCOPE

Syncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion. It is characterized by a rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery. It may be cardiac, neurocardiogenic (reflex), orthostatic, or due to other rare causes (Figs. 2.1-35 and 2.1-36, Table 2.1-29). Syncope should be differentiated from other causes of loss of consciousness such as epileptic seizure, hypoglycemia, SCD, and psychogenic causes that are not mediated by cerebral hypoperfusion.

HOCM, aortic stenosis, aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade) may cause cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope. They are discussed in detail in their relevant sections. Neurally mediated (reflex): There is generally a trigger (eg, carotid stimulation) that induces cardiovascular reflexes, instigating either hypotension or bradycardia or both. Examples include carotid sinus syndrome, situational, and vasovagal syncope (see Table 2.1-29).

Orthostatic: Orthostatic syncope is due to venous pooling that occurs on changing from a supine to an upright posture. Volume depletion or failure of arterial baroreceptors to provoke vasoconstriction of the systemic resistance vessels results in a dip in BP and syncope. Causes include drugs, postural tachycardia syndrome, volume depletion, and primary/secondary autonomic failure (see Table 2.1-29).
======================================
KEY FACT

Vasovagal is the most common etiology of syncope.

History/PE Age, triggers, prodromal symptoms, and associated symptoms should be investigated.

Family history should be elucidated (HOCM, LQTS).

(HOCM, LQTS). seizures. Unlike syncope, activity, tongue-biting, gradual). syndromes*is.shown in Table

Syncope can be confused with seizures. Unlike syncope, seizures may be characterized by a preceding aura, tonic-clonic activity, tongue-biting, bladder and bowel incontinence, and a postictal phase (ie, recovery is gradual).

Presentation of key syncope syndromes is shown in Table 2.1-29.

KEY FACT

Red flags with syncope include onset with exertion, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, severe headache, focal neurologic deficits, diplopia, ataxia, dysarthria, low back pain, or family history of SCD.

Diagnosis Initial syncope evaluation includes history, physical examination (including supine and standing BP), and ECG. Further testing depends on the suspected etiology.

KEY FACT

Cardiac syncope is associated with 1-year SCD rates of up to 40%.

Investigations for suspected cardiac causes:

Arrhythmias: Holter monitor or 2-week event recorder Structural heart disease: Echocardiogram Ischemia: Cardiac stress tests to look for ischemia Exercise testing for exertion-induced syncope

Investigations for neurally mediated (reflex) and orthostatic syncope:

CSM to assess for carotid sinus hypersensitivity Head-up tilt testing to rule out vasovagal, situational, or orthostatic causes Autonomic function tests (eg, analyzing BP, HR during Valsalva, deep breathing) to

identify autonomic failure

Other: Blood tests as indicated (oxygen saturation for hypoxemia, hematocrit for hemorrhage, troponins for ACS, D-dimers for PE)

KEY FACT

Vasovagal is the most common etiology of syncope.

Treatment Tailored to the etiology. Treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and structural cardiac diseases that cause syncope is

specific to the underlying condition and is described earlier in the text.

In patients with unexplained syncope or high risk of SCD (CAD, DCM, HCM,

arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, LQTS, Brugada), consider ICD.

Treatment of important neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope syndromes is covered in Table 2.1-29.

ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA)

A chronic inflammatory dermatitis that classically manifests in infancy and persists into adulthood. It is characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction (multifactorial; however, likely due to filaggrin deficiency), causing sensitization, which in turn leads to inflammation, pruritus, and ultimately lichenification (Fig. 2.2-2).

FIGURE 2.2-2. Atopic dermatitis. Lichenification, excoriations, and ill-defined, scaly erythematous plaques are characteristic. (Reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

Patients are at ↑ risk for secondary bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes) and viral (herpes simplex virus or molluscum) infection due to constant waxing and waning cycles of pruritus and excoriation.

Triggers include climate, food, skin irritants, and allergens. Manifestations by age group:

Infants (Fig. 2.2-3): Erythematous, edematous, weeping, pruritic vesicles, papules, and plaques on the face, scalp, and extensor surfaces of the extremities. The diaper area is often spared.

FIGURE 2.2-3. Atopic dermatitis in an infant. Characteristic involvement of the face and cheeks, which is not commonly seen in adults. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.)

Children: Dry, scaly, pruritic, excoriated vesicles, papules, and plaques in the flexural areas and neck.

Adults: Lichenification and dry, fissured skin in a flexural distribution. Often, there is hand, wrist, neck involvement.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Excluding contact dermatitis by history and anatomic distribution is important. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep can help distinguish chronic eczema from tinea. Mild peripheral eosinophilia and ↑ IgE may be seen but have no diagnostic value.
======================================
KEY FACT

Erythema toxicum neonatorum typically begins 1 to 3 days after delivery and presents with red papules, pustules, and/or vesicles with surrounding erythematous halos. ↑ eosinophils are present in the pustules or vesicles. This benign eruption usually resolves in 1 to 2 weeks with no treatment.

Treatment The primary goal of therapy is to break the itch-scratch cycle with agents targeted at

inflammation, pruritus, and xerosis (dry skin).

Topical corticosteroids are first-line therapy for flares, but atrophy, telangiectasias, and rebound flares can occur with prolonged use. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus) are useful as steroid-sparing agents for moderate to severe eczema for patients >2 years of age.

of pruritus. A for nighttime use. avoidance of harsh soaps, prevent future episodes.

H1-blockers may be used for relief of pruritus. A first-generation H1-blocker (eg, hydroxyzine) would be appropriate for nighttime use.

Aggressive use of emollients, avoidance of harsh soaps, and limiting hot showers after resolution of acute flares will prevent future episodes. Consider phototherapy and dupilumab treatment.

CONTACT DERMATITIS

A type IV hypersensitivity reaction that results from contact with an allergen to which the patient has previously been exposed and sensitized such as nickel, poison ivy, perfumes/deodorants, and neomycin. More common in adults.

History/PE Presents with pruritus and an eczematous rash, with the distribution of the rash often mimicking the contact event (Fig. 2.2-4). Characteristic distributions are seen where makeup, clothing, perfume, nickel jewelry, and plants come into contact with the skin.

FIGURE 2.2-4. Contact dermatitis. Shown are erythematous papules and vesicles with serous weeping localized to areas of contact with the offending agent. (Reproduced with permission from Hurwitz RM. Pathology of the Skin: Atlas of Clinical-Pathological Correlation, 2nd ed. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange; 1998.)

Often described as a “linear” or “angular” rash. It can spread over the body via transfer of allergen by the hands or via circulating T lymphocytes.

Frequently implicated allergens: Poison ivy, poison oak, nickel, topical over-the-counter antibiotics, cosmetics, and latex.

Poison ivy, poison history are-sufficient. used to establish the

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Excluding atopic dermatitis (eczema) is important. Patch testing can be used to establish the causative allergen after the acute-phase eruption has been treated.
======================================
KEY FACT

Patch testing results are affected by topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors but not by antihistamines, because type IV hypersensitivity reactions are not histamine mediated.

Treatment The best initial treatment involves topical corticosteroids and allergen avoidance. In severe cases, a systemic corticosteroid may be needed.

SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS

A common chronic inflammatory skin disease that may be caused by a reaction to Malassezia furfur, a generally harmless yeast found in sebum and hair follicles. It has a predilection for areas with sebaceous glands such as the eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and posterior ears.

History/PE Rash presentation varies with age: Infants: Severe, red diaper rash with yellow scale, erosions, and blisters. Scaling and

crusting (“cradle cap”) may be seen on the scalp (see Fig. 2.2-5A).

FIGURE 2.1-5. Seborrheic dermatitis. (A) Seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) in an infant. Note the yellow, scaly crust present on the infant’s scalp with an area of erosion.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Can be confused with atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, tinea, or psoriasis.

Treatment Treat adults with ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, or zinc pyrithione shampoos for the scalp and topical antifungals (ketoconazole cream) and/or topical corticosteroids for other areas. Cradle cap often resolves with routine bathing and application of emollients in infants.
======================================
PSORIASIS

A T-cell–mediated inflammatory dermatosis characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales (Fig. 2.2-6A) due to dermal inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia. Psoriasis can begin at any age.

FIGURE 2.2-6. Psoriasis. (A) Skin changes. The classic sharply demarcated plaques with silvery scales are commonly located on the extensor surfaces (eg, elbows, knees). (B) Nail changes. Note the pitting, onycholysis, and “oil spots.” (A reproduced with permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2013. B reproduced with permission from Hurwitz RM. Pathology of the Skin: Atlas of Clinical-Pathological Correlation, 2nd ed. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange; 1998.)

History/PE Lesions are classically found on the extensor surfaces, including the elbows and knees. Scalp and lumbosacral regions are often involved. Nails are frequently affected with pitting, “oil spots,” and onycholysis (lifting of the nail plate, see Fig. 2.2-6B).

Lesions initially appear small but may become confluent and can be provoked by local irritation or trauma (Koebner phenomenon). Some medications such as β-blockers, lithium, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can worsen psoriatic lesions.

Up to 30% develop psoriatic arthritis (affecting small joints of the hands and feet).

The asymmetric involvement of the rash, its linear arrangement (possibly from contact with a plant during the camping trip), and the time from exposure to rash presentation all point to contact dermatitis.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Classical presentation: Auspitz

sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale is scraped) overlying well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery “micaceous” scale.

Perform a biopsy if diagnosis is uncertain. Histology shows a thickened epidermis, elongated rete ridges, an absent granular cell layer, preservation of nuclei in the stratum corneum (parakeratosis), and a sterile neutrophilic infiltrate in the stratum corneum (Munro microabscesses).
======================================

factor (TNF) biologics (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab). Other agents such as ustekinumab (anti-interleukin [IL]-12/23), secukinumab (anti-IL17), and ultraviolet (UV) light therapy can be used for extensive skin involvement, except in immunosuppressed patients who can develop skin cancer from UV light.

Before starting methotrexate or anti-TNF biologics, patients should, at a minimum, get a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), hepatitis panel, and testing for TB (purified protein derivative [PPD] or interferon gamma release assay [IGRA]).

KEY FACT

“Sausage digits” and pencil-in-cup x-ray findings are suggestive of psoriatic arthritis.

URTICARIA (HIVES)

and prostaglandins demarcated edematous each lesion lasting <24

Results from the release of histamine and prostaglandins from mast cells in a type I hypersensitivity response. Sharply demarcated edematous plaques with surrounding erythema (“wheal and flare”) are seen, with each lesion lasting <24 hours. Can be acute or chronic (lasting >6 weeks).

History/PE Urticaria lesions (wheals) are erythematous or white transient papules or plaques

representing dermal edema. Lesions may be widespread.

In severe allergic reactions, extracutaneous manifestations can include tongue swelling, angioedema (deep, diffuse swelling often around the eyes and mouth; Fig. 2.2-7), asthma, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, joint swelling, and fever.

FIGURE 2.2-7. Urticaria (hives) and angioedema. This patient has urticaria occurring on the face, neck, and shoulders with orbital angioedema. (Reproduced with permission from Goldsmith LA et al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine, 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

Acute urticaria is a response to some often-unidentified trigger: food, drug, virus, insect bite, or physical stimulus (cold, heat, sun). Chronic urticaria is usually idiopathic.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Positive dermatographism (formation of wheals where the skin is stroked) may help. If in doubt, drawing a serum tryptase (co- released with histamine from mast cells) can help clinch the diagnosis. It can often be difficult to determine the cause of urticaria.

Treatment Treat urticaria with systemic antihistamines. Anaphylaxis (rare) requires intramuscular epinephrine, antihistamines, IV fluids, and airway support.
======================================
DRUG ERUPTION

Drug eruptions can range from a mild morbilliform rash (most common; Fig. 2.2-8) to the rare but life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Maintain a high suspicion for a cutaneous drug reaction in patients who are hospitalized and develop rashes. Drugs can cause all four types of hypersensitivity reactions (Table 2.2-2), and the same drug may cause different types of reactions in different persons.

FIGURE 2.2-8. Morbilliform rash. Morbilliform rash following drug administration. (Reproduced with permission from Longo DL et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

KEY FACT

Patients with drug eruptions often have peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophils on histopathology.

History/PE Non-anaphylactoid eruptions usually occur 7 to 14 days after exposure: If a patient reacts

within 1 to 2 days of starting a new drug, it is probably not the causative agent.

Eruptions are generally widespread, relatively symmetric, and pruritic. Most disappear within 1 to 2 weeks following removal of the offending agent. Extreme complications of drug eruptions include erythroderma, drug reaction with

eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and TEN.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Excluding other causes is important, including viral exanthema, graft-versus-host disease, and autoimmune dermatoses. A skin biopsy may be helpful if the diagnosis is not clear.

Treatment Discontinue the offending agent; treat symptoms with antihistamines and topical steroids to relieve pruritus. In severe cases, systemic steroids and/or IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used.

ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME

Erythema multiforme (EM) is a cutaneous reaction pattern with classic targetoid lesions (Fig. 2.2-9) that has many triggers and is often recurrent. Herpes simplex is the most common agent.

(Reproduced with permission

FIGURE 2.2-9. Erythema multiforme. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.)

History/PE Initially, lesions start as erythematous, dusky macules that develop into the characteristic target lesion that commonly affects the palms and soles. The target lesions are described as a central, dusky blister surrounded by a pale edematous ring with a peripheral halo of erythema. The palms, soles, and lips are often affected.

EM minor is uncomplicated and localized to the skin. EM major involves mucous membranes. It is a distinct entity from SJS, and there is no risk

for progression to TEN.

May have systemic symptoms, including fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and headache.
======================================
KEY FACT

EM is often triggered by infections such as HSV or mycoplasma. SJS and TEN are typically caused by drugs. Both are type IV hypersensitivity reactions.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. As opposed to SJS or TEN, in EM the Nikolsky sign is ⊖.

Treatment Symptomatic treatment is all that is necessary; systemic corticosteroids are of no benefit. EM minor can be managed supportively; EM major should be treated as burns.

KEY FACT

A differential diagnosis should always include SJS and TEN if a ⊕ Nikolsky sign is present.

STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME/TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS

SJS and TEN constitute two different points on the spectrum of life-threatening exfoliative mucocutaneous diseases that are often caused by a drug-induced immunologic reaction. The epidermal separation of SJS involves <10% of body surface area (BSA), whereas TEN involves >30% of BSA. Mucosal involvement is present in >90% of cases of SJS/TEN.

History/PE Exam reveals severe mucosal erosions with widespread erythematous, dusky red or

purpuric macules, or atypical targetoid lesions (Fig. 2.2-10). The epidermal lesions often become confluent and show a ⊕ Nikolsky sign (separation of the superficial skin layers with slight rubbing) and epidermal detachment.

FIGURE 2.2-10. Toxic epidermal necrolysis. Note the diffuse erythematous bullae and areas of sloughing secondary to the full-thickness necrosis of the epidermis.

Mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, and genitals) often become eroded and hemorrhagic. Associated with first-time exposure to drugs: sulfonamides, penicillin, seizure medications

(phenytoin, carbamazepine), quinolones, cephalosporins, steroids, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Diagnosis SJS/TEN: Biopsy shows full-thickness eosinophilic epidermal necrosis. Differential diagnosis should include staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), graft- versus-host reaction (usually after bone marrow transplant), radiation therapy, and burns.
======================================
KEY FACT

Do not confuse SJS and TEN with SSSS. SSSS is usually seen in children <6 years of age and does not present with targetoid lesions. SJS/TEN is generally seen in adults and is

usually caused by a drug rewaction.

Treatment High risk for mortality. Early diagnosis and discontinuation of offending agent are critical

in improving survival.

Patients have the same complications as burn victims—thermoregulatory and electrolyte disturbances and secondary infections, so use wound dressings for the skin and manage fluids and electrolytes.

Data on pharmacologic therapy with steroids, cyclosporine, and IVIG are mixed.

ERYTHEMA NODOSUM

A panniculitis (inflammatory process of the subcutaneous adipose tissue) triggered by infection (Streptococcus, Coccidioides, Yersinia, TB), drugs (sulfonamides, antibiotics, oral contraceptive pills [OCPs]), and chronic inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, Behçet disease).

History/PE Painful, erythematous nodules appear on the patient’s anterior shins (Fig. 2.2-11) and

slowly spread, turning brown or purple. Patients may present with fever and joint pain.

FIGURE 2.2-11. Erythema nodosum. Erythematous plaques and nodules are commonly located on pretibial areas. Lesions are painful and indurated but heal spontaneously without ulceration.

Patients with erythema nodosum may have a false-⊕ Venereal Disease Research Laboratory result (as in SLE).

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. A biopsy may help establish the diagnosis. Workup with an ASO titer, PPD in high-risk patients, and CXR to rule out sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease workup based on the patient’s complaints.

Treatment Investigate and treat the underlying disease. Cool compresses, bed rest, and NSAIDs are helpful. Potassium iodide may be considered for persistent cases.

Chronic relapsing-remitting, pruritic, coin-shaped, scaly plaques (Fig. 2.2-13) most commonly found on the extremities (nummun is Latin for coin). While the pathogenesis is unclear, it is thought to be associated with xerosis and decreased skin lipids. Diagnosis is clinical, and treatment includes use of emollients and avoidance of harsh soaps to prevent dry skin and use of topical glucocorticoids.

PYODERMA GANGRENOSUM

Neutrophilic dermatosis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis,

and underlying malignancy. Presents as papules or pustules that rapidly progress to a painful ulcer with a violaceous border and purulent base (Fig. 2.2-14). Demonstrates pathergy (formation of ulcers at sites of injury). Diagnosis depends on recognizing the clinical presentation and excluding other causes. Treatment involves local or systemic glucocorticoids.

======================================
Herpes Simplex

Painful, recurrent vesicular eruption of the mucocutaneous surfaces due to infection with HSV. Both serotypes can affect both genital and extragenital regions. The virus spreads through epidermal cells, fusing them into giant cells. The local host inflammatory response causes erythema and swelling.

KEY FACT

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) has vesicles and erosions like herpes but is NOT caused by HSV. DH consists of symmetric, bilateral pruritic papules, vesicles, bullae, and erosions on the elbows (Fig. 2.2-15), knees, buttocks, neck, and scalp, and it is associated with celiac disease (15%–25%). Treat with dapsone and a gluten-free diet.

FIGURE 2.2-15. Dermatitis herpetiformis. This disorder typically displays pruritic, grouped papulovesicles on elbows, knees, buttocks, and posterior scalp. Vesicles are often excoriated due to associated pruritus. (Reproduced with permission from Longo DL et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

History/PE The initial infection is by direct contact with oral or genital fluids; after the primary

episode, the virus remains dormant in local nerve ganglia: HSV-1 in the trigeminal ganglia and HSV-2 in sacral ganglia. First episodes are generally longer and more severe than recurrences.

Onset is preceded by prodromal tingling, burning, or pain but can also present with lymphadenopathy, fever, discomfort, malaise, and edema of involved tissue.

Recurrences are limited to mucocutaneous areas innervated by the involved nerve:

Recurrent oral herpes (HSV-1): The common “cold sore,” or herpes labialis, which presents as a cluster of crusted vesicles on an erythematous base (Fig. 2.2-16A). Often triggered by stress, sunlight, or infections.

FIGURE 2.2-16. Herpes simplex. (A) Herpes labialis. (B) HSV-1 lesions of the oral mucosa and tongue. (Image A reproduced with permission from the US Department of Health and Human Services and Dr. Herrmann. Image B reproduced with permission from the US Department of Health and Human Services and Robert E. Sumpter.)

Recurrent genital herpes (HSV-2): Unilateral and characterized by a cluster of ulcers on an erythematous base, but with less pain and systemic involvement than the primary infection.

X-ray of the chest (CXR) to look for bilateral hilar adenopathy, which is suggestive of sarcoidosis. Erythema nodosum is the most common nonspecific cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis, after cutaneous sarcoidosis.

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis: Grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. Most accurate test: Viral culture or PCR test of lesion. Direct fluorescent antigen is the

most rapid test.

Classic multinucleated giant cells on Tzanck smear (see Fig. 2.2-16B) support the diagnosis.

patients with small or valacyclovir may or those with a severe hours of the start of the

Treatment First episode: Immunocompetent patients with small lesions only need supportive

therapy, but acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir may be given to speed healing and reduce viral shedding.

Immunocompromised patients or those with a severe painful outbreak should receive an antiviral drug within 72 hours of the start of the outbreak.
======================================
KEY FACT

Herpetic whitlow presents as painful blisters/sores on the hand resembling “dew drops on a rose.” It is common in healthcare workers, respiratory therapists, dentists, and dishwashers.

Recurrent episodes: Minor lesions can be managed supportively. Acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir can be given during the episode to reduce healing time by ~2 days.

Severe frequent recurrences (>6 outbreaks per year): Daily prophylaxis with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir.

In patients with AIDS, HSV can persist, with ulcers remaining resistant to antiviral therapy. Symptomatic HSV infection lasting >1 month can be considered an AIDS- defining illness.

Varicella-Zoster Virus VZV causes two different diseases—varicella and herpes zoster—with transmission occurring via respiratory droplet or by direct contact. VZV has an incubation period of 10 to 20 days, with contagion beginning 24 hours before the eruption appears and lasting until lesions have crusted.

History/PE
======================================
A

Varicella: A prodrome of malaise, fever, headache, and myalgia occurs 24 hours before the rash. Pruritic lesions appear in crops over 2 to 3 days, evolving from red macules to vesicles that

then crust over.

At any given time, patients may have all stages of lesions present. The trunk, face, scalp, and mucous membranes are involved.

In adults, chickenpox is often more severe, with systemic complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.

Zoster: Herpes zoster (shingles) represents the recurrence of VZV in a specific nerve, with lesions appearing along the nerve’s dermatomal distribution. Outbreaks are usually preceded by intense local pain (acute herpetic neuralgia) followed by grouped blisters on an erythematous base (Fig. 2.2-17). Zoster can become disseminated in immunocompromised persons.

Acute herpetic neuralgia: Pain persisting less than 30 days from rash onset. Subacute herpetic neuralgia: Pain persisting longer than 30 days but less than 4 months

from rash onset.

Postherpetic neuralgia: Pain persisting greater than 4 months from rash onset. Herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome): Reactivation of VZV in the geniculate ganglion affecting cranial nerves (CNs) VII and VIII. Presents with shingles in the ear canal and pinna; CN VII involvement causes facial paralysis, and CN VIII involvement causes vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus: Reactivation of VZV along trigeminal nerve distribution. Presents with shingles in the trigeminal nerve distribution of V1, herpes zoster keratitis. This is a medical emergency, as it can cause blindness.

Older patients with zoster can develop postherpetic neuralgia (severe nerve pain that persists for >4 months at the infection site after rash onset).

Diagnosis PCR or viral culture test of lesion. Characteristic exam findings and history.

Treatment Varicella is self-limited in healthy children. A live attenuated vaccine is available that

should be given to children in two doses at ages 1 and 4. Also recommended for adults over 60 years of age. May be given to HIV patients with CD4+ cell count >200. Adults should be treated with systemic acyclovir to treat symptoms and prevent

complications. Pain control with NSAIDs for acute and subacute herpetic neuralgia and neuropathic agents (gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants) for postherpetic neuralgia.

vaccinated or had childhood varicella. If needed, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and newborns should receive varicella-zoster immune globulin within 10 days of exposure. Immunocompetent adults should receive a varicella vaccine within 5 days of exposure.

Complications Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome), and congenital varicella syndrome.

Molluscum Contagiosum A poxvirus infection that is most common in young children and in AIDS patients. It is spread by direct skin-to-skin contact (sports, sex) or sharing infected clothing or towels.
======================================
History/PE Presents as tiny, flesh-colored, dome-shaped, waxy papules, frequently with central

dome-shaped, waxy are found on the trunk, sexually transmitted perineal region. Typically

umbilication. In children, lesions are found on the trunk, extremities, or face (Fig. 2.2-18). In adults, they are considered sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and are commonly found on the genitalia and in the perineal region. Typically spares palms and soles.

FIGURE 2.2-18. Molluscum contagiosum. Flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules present on the face of an adolescent. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.)

Lesions are asymptomatic unless they become inflamed or irritated.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Most accurate test: If the diagnosis is uncertain, Wright and Giemsa stains show presence

of large inclusion or molluscum bodies on histology.

KEY FACT

If you see giant molluscum contagiosum, think HIV or ↓ cellular immunity.

Treatment Local destruction: Curetting, cryotherapy, laser ablation, or applying cantharidin (a

blistering agent) to the lesions.

In children, lesions resolve spontaneously over months to years and are occasionally left untreated.

Verrucae (Warts) Warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and can occur on skin, mucous membranes, and other epithelia. Although usually benign, some subtypes of HPV (especially 16 and 18) lead to squamous malignancies. Spread is by direct contact.

History/PE Common warts are most often seen on the hands, though they can occur anywhere. Classic genital warts (condyloma acuminatum, caused by HPV subtypes 6 and 11) are

cauliflower-like papules or plaques appearing on the penis, vulva, or perianal region (Fig. 2.2-19).

FIGURE 2.2-19. Verrucae (warts) caused by HPV. (A) Soft, tan-colored, cauliflower-like papules on hands. (B) Condyloma acuminatum on genitals. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.)

Mothers with genital warts can transmit HPV to the infant by aspiration during delivery, causing respiratory papillomatosis. Presents as a weak cry, hoarseness, and stridor.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Acetic acid turns lesions white and

can be used to visualize mucosal lesions.

Most accurate test: PCR of the lesion for HPV.

Treatment Genital warts are treated surgically with cryotherapy, laser therapy, and excision. Chemical treatment includes podophyllin (contraindicated in pregnancy) and trichloroacetic acid, and immunologic treatment includes imiquimod (contraindicated in pregnancy). Cervical lesions are monitored for evidence of malignancy. Prevent via vaccination and barrier methods of contraception.
======================================
BACTERIAL INFECTIONS

Skin and soft tissue bacterial infections are a diverse group of diseases that manifest in

different ways: red, inflamed papules and pustules centered around hair follicles are characteristic of folliculitis, while rapidly expanding, crepitant, dusky plaques suggest necrotizing fasciitis. Often, the clinical manifestation and treatment approach are dictated by the causative organism and the location of the infectious process within the layers of the skin and soft tissues. See Figure 2.2-20 for an illustration of the layers of the skin and associated depths of infection.

Folliculitis Epidermis{_ —|— Impetigo Erysipelas Dermis Hair follicle— Cellulitis Subcutaneous fat Necrotizing . fasciitis Fascia Muscle

FIGURE 2.2-20. Skin layers (blue) and depths of infection (red). (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Impetigo Local infection of the epidermis that primarily occurs in children and is caused by both group A streptococcal and staphylococcal organisms. It is highly contagious and transmitted by direct contact.

History/PE Nonbullous type: Pustules and honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base, often on the face around the mouth, nose, or ears (Fig. 2.2-21). Commonly caused by S aureus or group A streptococci (GAS).

FIGURE 2.2-21. Impetigo. Dried pustules with a superficial golden-brown crust are most commonly found around the nose and mouth. (Reproduced with permission from Bondi EE. Dermatology: Diagnosis and Therapy. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange; 1991.)

Bullous type: Characterized by flaccid bullae confined to the area of primary infection that form crusts when they rupture. Can involve the acral surfaces. Nikolsky sign is positive. Bullous impetigo is almost always caused by exfoliative toxin-producing strains of S aureus and can evolve into SSSS.

SSSS. exfoliative toxin. destroys as fever, generalized form crusts when they and adults with renal ulcerative lesions that extend

SSSS: Systemic dissemination of exfoliative toxin destroys desmoglein-1 in the stratum granulosum of the skin. Presents as fever, generalized erythema, and widespread superficial blisters that do not form crusts when they rupture. Nikolsky is positive. Common in neonates, children, and adults with renal insufficiency.

Ecthyma: Characterized by ulcerative lesions that extend into dermis. Appear as punched- out ulcers with yellow crusts.

Diagnosis Clinical. Gram stain or culture to identify causative organism (not necessary to start treatment).

Treatment Use antibiotics with antistaphylococcal activity based on severity and suspicion of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA): Mild localized disease: Topical antibiotics (mupirocin) are sufficient. Severe disease (non-MRSA) or ecthyma: Oral cephalexin or dicloxacillin. Severe disease (MRSA likely): Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, or

doxycycline.

SSSS: Nafcillin, vancomycin, and wound care. Return to school: The child may return to school 24 hours after the initiation of therapy.
======================================
Complications Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) SSS

Cellulitis A deeper skin infection involving dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Commonly caused by

staphylococci or group A streptococci originating from damaged skin or a systemic source. Community-acquired MRSA is an increasingly common cause of purulent cellulitis. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus (DM), IV drug use, venous stasis, and immune compromise.

KEY FACT

Scarlet fever: “Sandpaper” rash or “sunburn with goose bumps” appearance; strawberry tongue. Caused by S pyogenes. Treat with penicillin.

KEY FACT

Salmonella typhi: Small pink papules on the trunk (“rose spots”) in groups of 10 to 20 plus fever and GI involvement. Treat with fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. Consider cholecystectomy for chronic carrier state.

History/PE Presents with red, hot, swollen, tender skin. Fever and chills are common. Erysipelas is a type of cellulitis usually caused by GAS that is confined to the dermis and

lymphatic tissue, creating a characteristically raised, indurated, well-demarcated, erythematous area of skin (Fig. 2.2-22).

FIGURE 2.2-22. Erysipelas of the face. (Reproduced from Goldsmith LA et al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine, 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Wound and/or blood cultures may

aid in diagnosis and help determine antibiotic sensitivities.

Rule out abscess, osteomyelitis, and necrotizing fasciitis.

Treatment

Topical antibiotics are ineffective due to depth of infection. Use 5 to 10 days of oral antibiotics. IV antibiotics are indicated if there is evidence of

systemic toxicity, comorbid conditions, DM, extremes of age, or hand or orbital involvement.

Choice of antibiotic is similar to that used to treat impetigo (empiric treatment of S aureus and GAS).

Necrotizing Fasciitis Deep infection along a fascial plane causing severe pain followed by anesthesia and necrosis. Can be monomicrobial (GAS) or polymicrobial, usually caused by a mixed infection of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria that includes S aureus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens. Ten percent of cases are caused by S pyogenes. A history of trauma or recent surgery to the affected area is sometimes present.

History/PE Systemic: Fever, chills, altered mental status (AMS). Acute onset of pain out of proportion to findings and swelling progressing to anesthesia at

the site of trauma or surgery.

An area of erythema quickly spreads over the course of hours to days. Margins move out into normal skin, and skin becomes dusky or purplish near the site of insult, ultimately leading to necrosis (Fig. 2.2-23).

FIGURE 2.2-23. Necrotizing fasciitis of the lower extremity. Patient presented with hypotension due to late necrotizing fasciitis and myositis due to β-hemolytic streptococcal infection. (Reproduced with permission from Brunicardi FC et al. Schwartz’s Principles of Surgery, 9th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

If a necrotic area is open, gloved fingers can easily pass between two layers to reveal yellow-green necrotic fascia (infection spreads quickly in deep fascia).

Important signs of tissue necrosis are gas production (crepitus on physical exam); a putrid, gray-colored discharge (colloquially named dishwater fluid); bullae; severe pain; lack of inflammatory signs; and intravascular volume loss.

Diagnosis Strong suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis based on clinical exam and imaging (showing gas in soft tissue) requires immediate surgical exploration and debridement; tissue culture helps determine causative organisms.

Fournier gangrene is a form of necrotizing fasciitis that is localized to the genital and perineal area.
======================================
KEY FACT

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection leads to “hot tub folliculitis,” a pruritic, pustular folliculitis. Look for a history of exposure to wet, aquatic environments.

Treatment Surgical emergency: Early and aggressive surgical debridement is critical. In most cases, systemic broad-spectrum coverage is necessary. If Streptococcus is the

principal organism involved, penicillin G is the drug of choice. Clindamycin is added to ↓ exotoxin production. For anaerobic coverage, give metronidazole or a third-generation cephalosporin.

Folliculitis Inflammation and/or infection of a hair follicle. Typically caused by infection with Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and gram ⊖ bacteria. Occasionally can be caused by yeast such as Candida albicans or M furfur. Can occur on any area with follicles.

Q 1

A 7-year-old girl presents to the physician with fever, sore throat, and a facial rash. Physical examination reveals an erythematous pharynx without exudates and a red, painful patch on the child’s cheek that the mother notes has been expanding. What is the appropriate therapy?

A 42-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for cellulitis after injuring his leg while swimming. He is febrile and has a well-demarcated area of erythema on the anterior aspect of his right knee. Antibiotics are started. Six hours later, the patient is in excruciating pain. The erythema has spread circumferentially around the knee, and the anterior aspect of the knee now has a purplish hue. What is the next best step?

History/PE Presents as a tiny pustule at the opening of a hair follicle with a hair penetrating it. When

the infection is deeper, a furuncle, or hair follicle abscess, develops. Furuncles may disseminate to adjacent follicles to form a carbuncle (Fig. 2.2-24).

FIGURE 2.2-24. Carbuncle due to methicillin-sensitive S aureus. A very large, inflammatory plaque studded with pustules, draining pus, on the nape of the neck.

of Clinical Dermatology, DM, or immunosuppression patients, in whomthe history are sufficient.

Patients with exposure to hot tubs, DM, or immunosuppression are at ↑ risk. Eosinophilic folliculitis can occur in AIDS patients, in whom the disease is intensely pruritic and resistant to therapy.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. KOH prep or biopsy may be needed if fungus or eosinophilic folliculitis is suspected.

Treatment Topical antibiotics (mupirocin) treat mild superficial disease. More severe disease is treated similarly to impetigo, with cephalexin or dicloxacillin orally, escalating to clindamycin or doxycycline if MRSA is suspected. Hot tub folliculitis due to Pseudomonas is self-limiting and does not usually require treatment—severe disease can be treated with ciprofloxacin.

Acne Vulgaris A skin disease common among adolescents. The pathogenesis involves hormonal activation of sebaceous glands, the development of comedones (plugged pilosebaceous units), and involvement of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium) in the follicle, causing inflammation. Acne lesions can be caused by medications (lithium, corticosteroids) or by topical occlusion (cosmetics). Commonly seen with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and Cushing syndrome.

History/PE There are three stages of acne lesions:

Comedonal: Open (“blackheads”) or closed (“whiteheads”) comedones. Inflammatory: The comedones rupture, creating inflammatory papules, pustules,

nodules, and cysts.

Scar: May develop as inflammation heals. Picking at lesions exacerbates scarring. Acne develops at puberty and typically persists for several years. Male adolescents are

more likely to have severe cystic acne than females due to greater androgen production. Women in their 20s can have a variant that flares cyclically with menstruation, with fewer

comedones but more painful lesions on the chin.

Drug-induced acne is a common adverse effect of glucocorticoid use. These lesions are monomorphic papules without comedones, nodules, or cysts and do not respond to standard acne therapy. However, they usually resolve with discontinuation of the steroids. Acne mechanica occurs due to pressure or friction. Constant mechanical pressure damages

comedonal acne. Topical benzoyl peroxide kills C acnes. Consider adding a topical antibiotic (clindamycin, erythromycin) if response to other topicals is inadequate. Moderate to severe acne: In addition to topical treatment as noted earlier, add oral

antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline. When acne is severe and all treatments are failing, oral retinoids (isotretinoin) are the most effective treatment. All other acne medications are stopped.

Isotretinoin is a teratogen and elevates LFTs. Patients require periodic blood tests to check liver function, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Given the teratogenicity of isotretinoin, female patients must be on two forms of contraception (ie, barrier and hormonal) and are monitored with baseline and serial pregnancy tests.

hair. Most common in young men with excessive body hair.

History/PE Presents as an abscess at the superior gluteal cleft (Fig. 2.2-25) that can be tender, fluctuant, and warm—sometimes associated with purulent drainage or cellulitis. Systemic symptoms are uncommon, but cysts can develop into perianal fistulas.

FIGURE 2.2-25. Pilonidal cyst. Note the characteristic location in the superior gluteal cleft. May have purulent dis-charge, surrounding erythema, or a tuft of hair.

======================================
KEY FACT

General progression of acne treatment based on severity: topical benzoyl peroxide, retinoid, or antibiotic → oral antibiotic → oral isotretinoin

KEY FACT

Antibiotics are not needed for pilonidal cysts unless cellulitis is present; if antibiotics are prescribed, both aerobic and anaerobic coverage is required.

Treatment Treatment is with incision and drainage of the abscess followed by sterile packing of the

wound.

Excision of sinus tract if present. Good local hygiene and shaving of the sacrococcygeal skin can help prevent recurrence.

Leprosy Disease of skin and peripheral nerves, found in the Southwest United States and developing countries. Caused by acid-fast bacterium Mycobacterium leprae and causes chronic granuloma formation.

History/PE

Patients present with hypopigmented, hypoesthetic skin lesions, nerve thickening, and palsies of peripheral nerves. Clinical manifestations depend on type of leprosy.

Tuberculoid: One to two localized hypopigmented anesthetic plaques Lepromatous: Many plaques or nodules, leonine facies, hair loss (particularly eyebrows

and lashes), septal perforation

Diagnosis Skin scraping Punch biopsy Lepromin test

Treatment Treat tuberculoid leprosy with dapsone and rifampin. Add clofazimine for lepromatous or multibacillary leprosy.

Q

A 17-year-old female presents to the dermatologist for severe cystic acne that has been refractory to both topical and systemic antibiotics. She inquires about isotretinoin. Given this drug’s potentially hazardous adverse effects, what laboratory tests would be performed monthly if this patient were to be placed on isotretinoin?

placed on isotretinoin? a. o~ yeast that is part of normal make the organism

Tinea Versicolor Caused by Malassezia species, a yeast that is part of normal skin flora. Humid and sweaty conditions, as well as oily skin, can make the organism pathogenic. Cushing syndrome and immunosuppression are also risk factors.

History/PE Presents with small scaly patches of varying color on the chest or back (Fig. 2.2-26A).

FIGURE 2.2-26. Tinea versicolor. (A) Note the discrete, hypopigmented patches extensively involving the patient’s back. Tinea versicolor may also present as hyperpigmented macules or patches in some individuals. (B) KOH preparation shows the characteristic “spaghetti and meatballs” pattern of hyphae and spores. (A reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2011. B reproduced with

permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

Patches can be hypopigmented (alba) as a result of interference with melanin production or hyperpigmented/pink (rubra) due to inflammation.

Often discovered after sun exposure when lesions fail to tan and stand out.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are usually sufficient, but confirmatory testing is

useful to differentiate from other dermatologic disorders with similar findings.

Best initial test: KOH preparation of the scale revealing “spaghetti and meatballs” pattern of hyphae and spores (see Fig. 2.2-26B).
======================================
Treatment Treat lesions with topical ketoconazole or selenium sulfide.

Candidiasis Yeast infection or thrush, candidiasis can be caused by any Candida species but is most commonly caused by C albicans. In immunocompetent patients, it typically presents as eroded erythematous papules and plaques in intertriginous, moist areas such as the groin, skinfolds, axillae, vagina, and below the breasts. Oral thrush is common in infancy, but in adults it is often a sign of a weakened immune system.

antibiotic or steroid use, monthly for a female

History/PE Patients often have a history of antibiotic or steroid use, DM, or immunocompromise.

The laboratory tests to be performed monthly for a female patient taking isotretinoin for severe cystic acne would be serum or urine β-human chorionic gonadotrophin to rule out pregnancy, liver function tests (LFTs), cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush): Presents with painless white plaques on intraoral mucosal surfaces that can be easily scraped off to reveal erosions.

Candidiasis of the skin: Presents as markedly erythematous papules and plaques with occasional erosions and smaller satellite lesions (Fig. 2.2-27) seen nearby, often in skinfolds. In infants, infection is often seen in the diaper area and along the inguinal folds.

A

FIGURE 2.2-27. Cutaneous candidiasis with satellite lesions. (Reproduced with permission from Goldsmith LA et al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine, 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

Vulvovaginal candidiasis: Vaginal burning, dysuria, pruritis, white “cottage-cheese” discharge.

Candida esophagitis: Odynophagia in a patient with hematologic malignancy or AIDS.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Best initial test: KOH preparation of a scraping of the affected area. KOH dissolves the skin cells but leaves the Candida untouched such that Candida spores and pseudohyphae become visible.

Most accurate test: Blood culture. Endoscopy if esophageal involvement, antigen testing, tissue biopsy.
======================================
Treatment Oral candidiasis: Oral fluconazole tablets; nystatin swish and swallow, clotrimazole

troches.

Esophageal candidiasis: Systemic fluconazole, echinocandins, amphotericin B. Superficial (skin) candidiasis: Topical antifungals; keep skin clean and dry. Vulvovaginal candidiasis: Topical antifungal, single dose of oral fluconazole. Diaper rash: Topical nystatin.

with keratin (skin, nails, Microsporum, and circulation, immune common cause of recurrent of the body.

Dermatophyte Infections Dermatophytes are found in tissues with keratin (skin, nails, and hair). Causative organisms include Trichophyton (most common), Microsporum, and Epidermophyton species. Risk factors include DM, ↓ peripheral circulation, immune compromise, and chronic maceration of skin (from athletic activities). A common cause of recurrent infections is autoinoculation from a tinea infection on another site of the body.

History/PE Varies according to subtype: Tinea corporis (ringworm): Scaly, pruritic eruption with a well-demarcated, irregular border, often with central clearing (Fig. 2.2-28). Can be seen in immunocompromised patients or in children following contact with infected pets. The term ringworm is a misnomer due to the characteristic appearance of the lesion—it is caused by a fungus, not a worm or parasitic infection.

FIGURE 2.2-28. Tinea corporis. Note the ringworm rash with a scaly, erythematous, distinct border and central clearing. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

Tinea pedis/manuum (Fig. 2.2-29A): Presents as chronic interdigital scaling with erosions between the toes (athlete’s foot) or as a thickened, scaly skin on the soles (moccasin distribution). In addition, involvement of one hand is typical in the “one hand two feet syndrome.”

FIGURE 2.2-29. Cutaneous mycoses. (A) Tinea pedis; (B) Tinea cruris; (C) Tinea capitis. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.)

Tinea cruris (jock itch) (Fig. 2.2-29B): A fungal infection of the groin that is usually associated with tinea pedis. Pruritic plaque without central clearing, typically sparing the scrotum.

Tinea capitis (Fig. 2.2-29C): A fungal scalp infection causing scaling and hair loss with scarring. A large inflammatory boggy mass caused by tinea capitis is called a kerion. Tinea unguium (onychomycosis): A fungal nail infection causing brittle, discolored

nails.

Diagnosis Clinical Best initial test: KOH skin scraping showing hyphae Most accurate test: Fungal culture Wood’s lamp exam for Microsporum species

Treatment Start with topical antifungals; escalate to oral griseofulvin or terbinafine if infection is

widespread or unresponsive to topicals. Oral antifungals are indicated for nail involvement and tinea capitis (to penetrate into hair follicles); consider oral treatment for immunocompromised patients.

Sporotrichosis Infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a fungus found in plant matter. Often called “rose- gardener disease.” Acquired by direct contact, which causes a papule that drains odorless fluid. Additional lesions form over time along lines of lymphatic drainage, although lymphadenopathy is absent. Treat with itraconazole.
======================================
PARASITIC INFECTIONS

Lice Lice live off blood and on specific parts of the body, depending on their species (head lice, body lice, pubic lice). They are spread through body contact or by the sharing of bedclothes and other garments or hair accessories. Lice secrete local toxins that lead to pruritus.

History/PE Patients with lice often experience severe pruritus, and secondary bacterial infection of the

excoriations is a risk. Classroom breakouts of head lice are common.

Body lice are seen in persons with inadequate hygiene or in those with crowded living conditions. Pubic lice (called “crabs” because of their squat, crablike body shape) contain anticoagulant in their saliva, so their bites often become ecchymotic.

“crabs” because of their their bites often become on hairs or in clothes and:their droppings.

Diagnosis Lice and their eggs (nits) can be seen on hairs or in clothes with the naked eye. Microscopy can reveal the arthropods, their eggs, and their droppings.

Treatment Head lice: Treat with topical permethrin, pyrethrin, benzyl alcohol, and mechanical

removal.

Body lice: Wash body, clothes, and bedding thoroughly. Rarely, topical permethrin is needed.

Pubic lice: Treat with the same medications as for head lice.

Scabies Caused by Sarcoptes scabiei. The burrowing of this arthropod into the epidermis leads to pruritus that ↑ in intensity once an allergy to the mite or its products develops. Secondary bacterial infections due to scratching are common. Scabies mites are spread through close contact.

History/PE Patients present with intense pruritus, especially at night and after hot showers, and

erythematous papules with linear tracts, representing the burrows of the mite (Fig. 2.2- 30A).

FIGURE 2.2-30. Scabies. (A) Linear tracts made as the mite burrows into the skin (yellow arrow). (B) Erythema-tous papules in interdigital web spaces (black arrow).

The most commonly affected sites are the skinfolds of the hands (often includes the interdigital finger webs), axillae, genitals, and flexor surfaces of the wrists (see Fig. 2.2- 30B).

Crusted scabies is severe, diffuse skin involvement with crusts and scales seen in the immunocompromised (eg, HIV).

members is suggestive. looking under the microscope

Diagnosis A history of pruritus in several family members is suggestive. The mite may be identifiable by scraping an intact tunnel and looking under the microscope for the arthropods, their eggs, and their droppings.
======================================
KEY FACT

Lice can be seen with the naked eye. Scabies mites are too small and can only be identified with a microscope/dermatoscope.

Treatment Patients should be treated with 5% permethrin from the neck down (head to toe for infants) for at least two treatments separated by 1 week, and their close contacts should be treated as well. Oral ivermectin is also effective.

Treatment for crusted scabies: Oral ivermectin in combination with topical permethrin. Pruritus can persist up to 2 weeks after treatment. Clothes and bedding should be thoroughly washed.

Bed Bugs Painless erythematous papules on exposed skin due to bites from Cimex lectularius at night. Mild pruritus, which is worse at night and in the morning. Lesions seen in a linear “breakfast, lunch, and dinner” pattern. Transmitted by contact with infested beddings and furniture. Treat pruritis with topical steroids and antihistamines; use insecticides or heat to remove infestation.

Cutaneous Larva Migrans Erythematous, serpentine, migratory rash marked by pruritic maculopapular lesion at the site of larval entry due to infection with hookworm larvae, commonly acquired by walking barefoot on grass or sand. Treat with ivermectin.

ISCHEMIC SKIN DISORDERS

DECUBITUS ULCERS

Result from ischemic necrosis following continuous pressure on an area of skin that restricts microcirculation (Fig. 2.2-31).

FIGURE 2.2-31. Depth of skin ulcers. Stage 1 involves intact skin with nonblanchable erythema. Stage 2 involves partial-thickness loss of dermis; however, deeper structures are intact. Stage 3 involves full-thickness loss of epidermis and subcutaneous fascia; however, muscle and bone are not exposed. Stage 4 involves full-thickness tissue loss with exposed underlying structures such as muscle or bone. Unstageable ulcers are covered with black eschar, making it difficult to determine depth of injury. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

History/PE Ulcers are commonly seen in bedridden patients who lie in the same spot for too long. An underlying bony prominence or lack of fat ↑ the likelihood of ulcer formation (sacrum, heels). Patients with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays or lacking mobility or cutaneous sensation are also at ↑ risk. Incontinence of urine or stool may macerate the skin, facilitating ulceration.

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Occasionally, a biopsy can be performed on a nonhealing ulcer to rule out cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, infection, and/or pyoderma gangrenosum. Bone biopsy to diagnose osteomyelitis if bony exposure.

Treatment Prevention is key: Routinely reposition bedridden patients (at least once every 2 hours); special beds can distribute pressure. Nutritional optimization to promote wound healing. If an ulcer develops, low-grade lesions can be treated with routine wound care, including

hydrocolloid dressings. High-grade lesions require surgical debridement.
======================================
GANGRENE

Necrosis of body tissue. There are three subtypes as follows: Dry gangrene: Due to insufficient blood flow to tissue, typically from atherosclerosis. Wet gangrene: Involves bacterial infection, usually with skin flora. Gas gangrene: Due to C perfringens infection.

History/PE Dry gangrene: Early signs are a dull ache, cold, and pallor of the flesh. As necrosis sets

in, the tissue (toes, fingers) becomes bluish-black, dry, and shriveled. Diabetes, vasculopathy, and smoking are risk factors.

Wet gangrene: The tissue appears bruised, swollen, or blistered with pus. Gas gangrene: Occurs at sites of large trauma/surgery compromising blood flow to a region, bringing about an anaerobic environment. Bacteria rapidly destroy tissue, producing gas that separates healthy tissue and exposes it to infection. Associated with dirty wounds contaminated with dirt or bowel/fecal matter. IV drug use is a risk factor. Presents with swelling and pale or dark-red skin around the injury. A medical emergency.

healthy tissue and exposes dirt or bowel/fecal or dark-red skin around history-are sufficient. Air

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Air in soft tissue on x-ray is very suggestive of necrosis (Fig. 2.2-32).

FIGURE 2.2-32. Gas gangrene. X-ray of the foot showing gas tracking through soft tissues, most clearly seen overlying the calcaneus. (Reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

Treatment Emergency surgical debridement, with amputation if necessary, is the mainstay of

treatment. Antibiotics alone do not suffice by virtue of inadequate blood flow, but they should be given as an adjuvant to surgery.

Hyperbaric oxygen (toxic to the anaerobic C perfringens) can be used after debridement to help with treatment.

MISCELLANEOUS SKIN DISORDERS

STASIS DERMATITIS

Lower extremity dermatitis due to venous hypertension forcing blood from the deep to the superficial venous system. Venous hypertension is often a result of venous valve incompetence or flow obstruction. It commonly involves the medial ankle in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) history, chronic edema, and long periods of standing. If untreated, the area can become inflamed, exudative, and hyperpigmented from hemosiderin deposition (Fig. 2.2-33). Stasis ulcers may develop. Treat early with leg elevation, compression stockings, emollients, and topical steroids.

======================================
ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS

A condition in which the skin in the intertriginous zones (neck folds, genitals, axillae) becomes hyperkeratotic and hyperpigmented with a velvety appearance (Fig. 2.2-34).

FIGURE 2.2-34. Acanthosis nigricans. Velvety, dark-brown epidermal thickening of the armpit

is seen with prominent skinfold and feathered edges. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Color Atlas & Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology. 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2013.)

Associated with DM (insulin resistance), Cushing disease, PCOS, and obesity. May also be a paraneoplastic sign of underlying adenocarcinoma (usually GI).

Treatment: Typically not treated. The physician can encourage weight loss and treat the underlying endocrinopathy.

LICHEN PLANUS

A self-limited, recurrent, or chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin, oral mucosa, and genitalia. Lesions classically described using the 6 Ps (Planar, Purple, Polygonal, Pruritic, Papules, and Plaques). It may be induced by drugs (thiazides, quinines, β-blockers) and is associated with HCV infection.

History/PE Presents with violaceous, flat-topped, polygonal papules (Fig. 2.2-35). Wickham striae (lacy white lines) may be present on the lesion. Lesions may demonstrate prominent Koebner phenomena (lesions that appear at the site of trauma).

FIGURE 2.2-35. Lichen planus. Flat-topped, polygonal, sharply defined papules of violaceous color are grouped and confluent. The surface is shiny and reveals fine white lines (Wickham striae). (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine. 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

Treatment Mild cases are treated with topical corticosteroids. For severe disease, systemic corticosteroids and phototherapy may be used.

ROSACEA

A chronic disorder of pilosebaceous units of which the etiology is unclear.

Diagnosis Presentation can vary depending on the subtype as follows: Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea: Presents with central facial erythema with

telangiectasias.

Papulopustular rosacea: Develops papules and pustules. Phymatous rosacea: Connective tissue overgrowth on the chin, forehead, and other areas

of the face. May lead to severe overgrowth of nasal connective tissue known as rhinophyma (Fig. 2.2-36).

FIGURE 2.2-36. Rhinophyma. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Color Atlas & Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology. 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

Ocular rosacea: Can predispose to blepharitis, stye, and chalazion formation.

======================================
older age group.

Treatment Behavioral: sunlight and alcohol avoidance, skin hygiene, and emollient use Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea: topical brimonidine or laser therapy Papulopustular rosacea: topical metronidazole Phymatous rosacea: oral isotretinoin or laser therapy Severe/ocular rosacea: oral doxycycline

PITYRIASIS ROSEA

An acute dermatitis of unknown etiology that has been hypothesized to represent a reaction to a viral infection with HHV-7.

History/PE Initial lesion is classically a herald patch that is erythematous with a peripheral scale. Days to weeks later, a secondary eruption appears: multiple scaling papules and plaques with a fine “cigarette paper” scale (Fig. 2.2-37). Papules are arranged along skin lines, giving a classic “Christmas tree” pattern on the patient’s back.

FIGURE 2.2-37. Pityriasis rosea. The round to oval erythematous plaques are often covered with a fine white scale (“cigarette paper”) and are often found on the trunk and proximal extremities. Plaques are often preceded by a larger herald patch (inset). (Reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw- Hill; 2011.)

KEY FACT

Pityriasis rosea spares palms and soles, whereas secondary syphilis does not.

Diagnosis Diagnosis is clinical. Confirm with KOH exam to rule out fungus (the herald patch may be mistaken for tinea corporis). Consider testing for secondary syphilis, which can present similarly.

any treatment. Supportive

Treatment Rash heals in 6 to 8 weeks without any treatment. Supportive therapy to manage symptoms includes emollients and antihistamines.

VITILIGO

Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes leading to well-demarcated areas of depigmentation. Frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism and type I DM.

History/PE: Sharply demarcated, depigmented macules or patches on otherwise normal skin, often on the hands, face, or genitalia (Fig. 2.2-38). Vitiligo can present at any age and vary from small areas of involvement with or without progression to large areas of depigmentation.

FIGURE 2.2-38. Vitiligo of the hands. Areas of sharply demarcated depigmentation. (Reproduced

with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.)

Diagnosis: Often clinical. Many patients have serologic markers of autoimmune disease (eg, antithyroid antibodies, type 1 DM, pernicious anemia) and occasionally present with these diseases. Histologic examination demonstrates the absence of melanocytes and melanin pigment. Examination of skin under Wood’s lamp may be helpful for diagnosis. Treatment: For patients with rapidly progressive vitiligo, oral glucocorticoids can be used to prevent further spread of lesions. Topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus ointment, JAK inhibitors, UV, and laser therapy can be used in stable vitiligo. Sunscreen prevents burns. Cover-up makeup can help with cosmetic concerns.
======================================
EYELID LESIONS

Xanthelasma: Soft yellow plaques seen on the medial aspects of the eyelids bilaterally (Fig. 2.2-39), associated with hyperlipidemia and primary biliary cirrhosis. Serum total cholesterol is often normal. Treatment is not necessary.

Hordeolum: Painful acute eyelid gland infection (stye), usually due to S aureus and located on the edge of the lid. Most resolve spontaneously, but warm, moist compresses may help.

Chalazion: Chronic inflammatory painless cyst due to a blocked eyelid gland. Hordeolum can become a chalazion after the infection resolves.

EPIDERMAL INCLUSION CYSTS

Dome-shaped, firm or freely movable cyst often surrounding a hair follicle (Fig. 2.2-40). Erythema, mild tenderness, and cheeselike discharge may be seen.

FIGURE 2.2-40. Specimen of an epidermal inclusion cyst, with intact capsule. The cyst is filled with keratin cells. (Reproduced with permission from Tsirevelou et al. Epidermoid cyst of the floor of the mouth: two case reports. Cases J. 2009;2:9360. doi: 10.1186/1757-1626-2-9360).

Does not dimple when pinched (in contrast with dermatofibroma). Usually resolves spontaneously, but can recur; thus excision of large cysts is preferred.

DERMATOFIBROMA

Dome-shaped, firm, brown-pink, nontender nodule often <1 cm in diameter resulting from fibroblast proliferation (Fig. 2.2-41).

Dimples when pinched (dimple or buttonhole sign). Benign. Treatment with excision for cosmetic reasons.
======================================
HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA

Chronic inflammation of folliculopilosebaceous units causing inflamed, painful nodules that may progress to form sinus tracts and scars that secrete a malodorous discharge (Fig. 2.2-42). It is more common in people with family history, Black race, smoking history, diabetes, or obesity.

Common in intertriginous areas (axilla, groin) and often has a chronic relapsing course. Diagnosis: Clinical. No biopsy needed. Treatment: Oral antibiotics (topical clindamycin is often first line), drainage, wound care, or surgical excision and skin grafting of affected areas. Could result in relapsing course despite medical and surgical management. Weight loss and smoking cessation are recommended.

ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS

Disorder of diffuse, dry dermal scaling that resembles fish scales (ichthyosis means “fishlike” in Greek; Fig. 2.2-43). Most often affects the extremities and trunk. Patients experience a worsening of symptoms in dry, cold weather.

FIGURE 2.2-43. Ichthyosis vulgaris. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard S. Hibbets, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.)

Inherited mutation in filaggrin gene; worse in homozygous individuals. Filaggrin plays a role in maintaining hydration of the skin with an epidermal skin barrier.

Diagnosis is clinical. Treat with emollients and moisturizers.

AGE-RELATED SKIN CHANGES

The elastic fibers in perivascular connective tissue deteriorate with age, causing wrinkles. The dermis and epidermis also thin, causing increased fragility of the skin. Chronically photoaged skin will develop solar elastosis (thickened yellow skin with deep wrinkles).

Botulinum toxin A may be used for cosmetic purposes to reduce development of wrinkles (paralysis of facial musculature). Senile purpura (ecchymoses in older adult patients in areas exposed to repetitive trauma such as extensor surfaces) is a benign finding and does not warrant further workup.
======================================
SUN PROTECTION

UV radiation from the sun causes hyperpigmentation and destruction of dermal structural proteins, such as collagen and elastin. Sun avoidance is the best way to prevent sun- associated skin damage. Sunblock with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 applied 30 minutes prior to exposure provides a protective film that prevents sunburn. SPF of greater than 50 has diminishing returns on effective sun protection. Reapplication of sunblock should occur every 2 hours, especially after swimming or sweating.

SUNBURN

Self-limiting, inflammatory skin condition occurring in response to prolonged exposure to UV radiation. Vasodilation of dermal blood vessels causes an erythematous appearance to the skin and occasionally blistering lesions. Patients with severe sunburn may exhibit symptoms of heat exhaustion such as fever, headache, and vomiting. Mild sunburn may be treated with cool, moist compresses and emollients with aloe vera for topical relief and NSAIDs for pain relief. Consider hospitalization, IV fluids, and wound care for severe cases.

SEBORRHEIC KERATOSIS

A very common skin tumor in people older than 50 years of age. Unknown etiology. Though lesions may appear similar to melanoma, they have no malignant potential.

History/PE Present as exophytic, waxy, brown papules and velvety or greasy plaques with superficial keratin cysts (Fig. 2.2-44). Lesions may appear in great numbers and have a “stuck on” appearance.

Treatment Cryotherapy, shave excision, or curettage.
======================================
ACTINIC KERATOSIS

Flat areas of erythema and scale caused by sun exposure in fair-skinned individuals. These lesions have a 5% to 10% chance of developing into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Lesions must be treated before progression to malignancy. Hx/PE: Lesions appear on sun-exposed areas (face, arms) and primarily affect older

patients, who often have multiple such lesions. They are erythematous with a sandpaper- like texture that can become thick and crusted (Fig. 2.2-46).

Dx: Clinical. Biopsy may be indicated to differentiate from SCC. Tx: Cryosurgery, topical 5-FU, or topical imiquimod can be used to destroy the lesion.

Patients should be advised to use sun protection.

CUTANEOUS SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

The second most common skin cancer, with locally destructive effects as well as the potential for metastasis and death. Sun exposure is the most common causative factor, but exposure to chemical carcinogens, prior radiation therapy, chronic inflammation and chronic wounds (eg, burns or draining infectious sinuses in osteomyelitis), and chronic immunosuppression (eg, transplant recipients) also predispose patients to developing SCC. Keratoacanthomas are a low-grade type of SCC.

History/PE SCCs have many forms, and a single patient will often have multiple variants. Most SCCs occur in older adults with sun-damaged skin arising from actinic keratoses and

presenting as an erythematous, ulcerated papule or nodule (Fig. 2.2-47).

FIGURE 2.2-47. Squamous cell carcinoma. Note the crusting and ulceration of this erythematous plaque. Most lesions are exophytic nodules with erosion or ulceration. (Reproduced with permission from Hurwitz RM. Pathology of the Skin: Atlas of Clinical-Pathological Correlation. 2nd ed. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange; 1998.)

Neurologic signs/symptoms may be due to perineural invasion. Marjolin ulcer is a type of rare SCC that arises in sites of scars, burns, or ulcers. Marjolin

ulcers typically take 5 to 10 years to develop after the initial wound.

Arsenic exposure is a rare cause of multiple SCCs in a palmoplantar distribution. SCC in situ is called Bowen disease and presents as a well-defined, erythematous, scaly

and presents as.a it is called erythroplasia metastasize, but those occurs on the lower lip

plaque. When found on the penis, it is called erythroplasia of Queyrat and presents as red, velvetlike plaques.

SCCs from actinic keratoses rarely metastasize, but those that arise on the lips and ulcers are more likely to do so. SCC occurs on the lower lip more commonly than basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

Diagnosis Characteristic exam findings and history are sufficient. Confirm with shave biopsy, which may show keratin pearls and full-thickness atypical keratinocytes with invasion into the dermis.

Treatment Surgical excision or Mohs surgery (very thin slices are excised and examined with a microscope via frozen section, ideally used for cosmetically sensitive areas such as face and distal extremities). Lesions with high metastatic potential may need radiation or chemotherapy.
======================================
BASAL CELL CARCINOMA

The most common malignant skin cancer, BCC is slow growing and locally destructive but has virtually no metastatic potential. Cumulative sun exposure is the main risk factor. Most lesions appear on the face in fair-skinned individuals. Multiple BCCs appearing early in life and on non–sun-exposed areas are suggestive of inherited basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome).

History/PE Nodular subtype (Fig. 2.2-48) makes up 80% of BCC. Other types include superficial and

sclerosing. Pearly-white, translucent, dome-shaped nodule or papule that may ulcerate, bleed, or crust in the center with overlying telangiectasias.

MELANOMA

The most common life-threatening dermatologic disease. Risk factors include fair skin and a tendency to burn; intense bursts of sun exposure (especially in childhood and with intermittent exposure); and the presence of large congenital melanocytic nevi, an ↑ number of nevi, or dysplastic nevi. Immunosuppression also ↑ risk. Some patients inherit a predisposition to melanoma with the familial atypical mole and melanoma (FAM-M) syndrome. There are several subtypes (Table 2.2-5).

TABLE 2.2-5. Types of Melanoma
======================================
TYPE PRESENTATION Superficial 60% of all melanomas; incidence increases with age, but is also seen in young adults spreading Often presents on the trunk in men and on the legs in women A prolonged horizontal growth phase (see Image A) allows for early diagnosis when it is still confined to the epidermis Nodular Lesions have a rapid vertical growth phase and appear as a fast-growing reddish-brown nodule with ulceration (see Image B) Acral Begins on the palms, soles (see Image C), and nailbed as a slowly spreading, pigmented patch lentiginous Most commonly seen in Asian and Black populations Lentigo Arises in a solar lentigo maligna Usually found on sun-damaged skin of the face (see Image D) Amelanotic Presents as a lesion without clinical pigmentation Difficult to identify; this variant of melanoma can be further classified into any of the above types GE MTT Images reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.

the epidermal basal layer, metastasize anywhere in the with metastatic melanoma

History/PE Malignant melanomas begin in the epidermal basal layer, where melanocytes are found. Malignant melanomas may metastasize anywhere in the body (eg, lung, liver, brain, fat).

Three to five percent of patients with metastatic melanoma have no known primary lesion.

Q

A 72-year-old man presents to an internist after moving to Florida. The internist notes a chronic wound on the patient’s right lower leg in the area of a previous flame burn. The patient states that the wound has been present for 5 years and has not healed despite receiving dressings and topical treatment. What is the next best step?

Diagnosis Early recognition and treatment are essential. Screening exams using the ABCDE criteria and dermoscopy may detect melanoma early when it is curable (see Table 2.2-5). An excisional biopsy should be performed on any suspicious lesion. Malignancy is determined histologically.

A biopsy should be performed on a mole that is substantially different from nearby moles to assess for melanoma. This is the “ugly duckling sign” and has greater than 90% sensitivity for melanoma.

Malignant melanomas are staged by Breslow thickness (depth of invasion in millimeters) and by tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging. Ulceration is a poor prognostic sign.

Treatment Lesions confined to the skin are treated by excision with margins. Sentinel lymph node

biopsy is useful for staging but does not ↑ survival. Chemotherapy, biologic therapy, and

radiation therapy may be used for recurrent or metastatic melanoma.

Patients with early melanoma are at low risk for recurrence but are at high risk for the development of subsequent melanomas. More advanced melanomas may recur or metastasize at a higher rate. Patient surveillance is thus essential.

The next best step would be to perform a biopsy to rule out SCC.
======================================
KAPOSI SARCOMA

A vascular proliferative disease that has been attributed to HHV-8, also called Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

History/PE Presents with multiple red to violaceous macules, papules, or nodules that can progress to

plaques on the lower limbs, back, face, mouth, and genitalia (Fig. 2.2-49).

FIGURE 2.2-49. Kaposi sarcoma. Note the multiple violaceous papules on the neck, back, and face. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Color Atlas & Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology. 5th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2005.)

Plaques can also be found in the GI tract and lung. HIV-associated (epidemic) Kaposi sarcoma is an aggressive form of the disease, and

although less common since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), it remains the most common HIV-associated malignancy.

Diagnosis Diagnosed by history, clinical impression, and histology.

A

Treatment Start HAART therapy if patient is HIV⊕. Small local lesions can be treated with radiation or cryotherapy. Widespread or internal disease is treated with systemic chemotherapy (doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or interferon-α [IFN-α]).

KEY FACT

Bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana, can mimic Kaposi sarcoma and should be excluded in suspected Kaposi sarcoma patients; erythromycin is the treatment of choice.

MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES (CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA)

Not a fungus but a slow, progressive neoplastic proliferation of epidermotropic T cells. The disease is chronic and more common in men.

History/PE Early lesions are nonspecific, psoriatic-appearing plaques or patches that are often pruritic

with a predilection for the trunk and buttocks. Later lesions are characterized by skin tumors with palpable lymph nodes (Fig. 2.2-50).

FIGURE 2.2-50. Mycosis fungoides. Massive nodular infiltration of the face leads to a leonine facies. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K et al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine. 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

Patients may have dermatopathic lymphadenopathy without tumor involvement of the node. However, the internal organs can be involved, including the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.

Sézary syndrome is the leukemic phase of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, characterized by circulating Sézary cells in the peripheral blood, erythroderma, and lymphadenopathy.

Diagnosis Diagnosed by clinical features and histology, with immunophenotypic characterization showing clonal T cells and electron microscopy showing the typical Sézary or Lutzner cells (cerebriform lymphocytes).

Early lesions are clinically indistinguishable from dermatitis, so histologic diagnosis is indicated for any dermatitis that is chronic and resistant to treatment.

Treatment Phototherapy and skin-directed topical treatments are the mainstay of treatment for many patients. Early localized disease is amenable to total skin electron beam irradiation. For more extensive or advanced disease, radiation therapy is an effective option. Treatment modalities, including steroids, chemotherapy, retinoids, monoclonal antibodies, and IFN-α, are often combined.
======================================
CHERRY ANGIOMAS (HEMANGIOMAS)

Small, vascular, red papules that can appear anywhere on the body (Fig. 2.2-51). It is the most common benign vascular tumor, and it often appears with age. No treatment is necessary, but it can be excised for cosmetic reasons.

FIGURE 2.2-51. Cherry hemangioma. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Richard Usatine.)

INFANTILE HEMANGIOMAS

Similar to cherry angiomas, infantile hemangiomas (also called strawberry hemangiomas) are seen in infants during the first few weeks of life. They are also benign and usually regress spontaneously after an initially rapid growth phase. Involution typically begins at 9 months to 1 year of age. Persistent lesions may be treated with topical or oral β-blockers.

PYOGENIC GRANULOMA

Lobulated capillary hemangioma that typically occurs on the fingers, trunk and oral mucosa in young adults (Fig. 2.2-52). Ulcerates and bleeds profusely. Associated with trauma and pregnancy likely due to increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in pregnancy. Treated via surgical excision, laser therapy, or topical silver nitrate. Lesions that occur during pregnancy may regress spontaneously postpartum.

FIGURE 2.2-52. Pyogenic granuloma. (Modified with permission from Dr. Richard Ustaine.)

NECROBIOSIS LIPOIDICA

Red-brown to yellow annular plaques found on the lower extremities of patients with DM (Fig. 2.2-53). More common in women and classically found on pretibial skin. Presents as multifocal lesions with dilated blood vessels and central epidermal atrophy that may ulcerate. Lesions may precede the onset of diabetes; consequently, patients should be screened for DM.

METABOLIC SYNDROME

Metabolic syndrome refers to a constellation of findings suggestive of insulin resistance that frequently develop in the setting of obesity. The often-associated hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and release of adipokines are thought to increase risk for development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).

DIABETES MELLITUS

DM refers to abnormal carbohydrate metabolism that leads to hyperglycemia through several mechanisms, including impairment of insulin secretion and resistance of peripheral tissues to the action of insulin.

History/PE The presentation of diabetes is variable (often asymptomatic), and it depends on the specific etiology. Generally:

Type 1 DM classically presents in children and young adults with symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia), polyphagia, unexplained weight loss, or ketoacidosis.

metabolic syndrome, but it is increasingly diagnosed in children. Other risk factors include ⊕ family history, sedentary lifestyle, increasing age, and ethnicity (Asian, Hispanic, and African descent in the United States). Although it may present with symptoms of hyperglycemia—in the same manner as type 1 DM—it tends to be more insidious, and patients frequently exhibit complications of long-term diabetes (see Table 2.3-1) at time of diagnosis.
======================================
TABLE 2.3-1. Chronic Complications of Diabetes Mellitus

COMPLICATION DESCRIPTION, MANAGEMENT, AND PREVENTIVE CARE Retinopathy (non- proliferative, proliferative) Classically appears when diabetes has been present for at least 3-5 years (see Fig. 2.3-1). Preventive measures include control of hyperglycemia and hypertension and annual eye exams. Treatment modalities include anti-vascular endo- thelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and laser photocoagulation therapy. Diabetic nephropathy Neuropathy Characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration followed by microalbuminuria, macroproteinuria, and progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Prevalence is estimated to be 20%-40% in those with DM. Preventive measures include glycemic control, tight BP control (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEls] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] in the setting of proteinuria). Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules are classically seen on kidney biopsy. Prevalence of diabetic neuropathy increases with longer duration/worsening severity of hyperglycemia. Can affect both small nerve fibers (pain, temperature) and large fibers (vibration, proprioception). Most commonly manifests as distal symmetric polyneuropathy (stocking and glove” numbness, tingling, burning pain). Can also present as autonomic neuropathy (postural hypotension, gastroparesis, diarrhea, neurogenic bladder, erectile dysfunction). Cranial mononeu- ropathies can also occur—cranial nerve (CN) Il involvement is more common (ptosis, diplopia, preserved pupil response). Emphasize preventive foot care. Monofilament testing predicts ulcer risk. Neuropathic pain can be managed with tricy- clic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or gabapentinoids. Gastroparesis with delayed gastric emptying can be managed with metoclopramide or erythromycin. Macrovascular complications Hypoglycemia unawareness Cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in diabetic patients. See Table 2.3-2 for risk modification recommendations. Inadequate autonomic response to hypoglycemia caused by insufficient release of stress hormones. It tends to develop in people who have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, and it can lead to failure to recognize life-threatening hypoglycemia.

FIGURE 2.3-1. Diabetic retinopathy. (A) Nonproliferative retinopathy presents with exudates, dot-blot hemorrhages, and microaneurysms. (B) Proliferative retinopathy presents with macular edema, vitreous traction, and neovascularization of the retinal vasculature. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Microalbuminuria cannot be detected on routine urinalysis (UA) protein dipstick. Instead, do a spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio (microalbuminuria = 30 to 300 mg/g).
======================================
Diagnosis Diagnosis requires:

A random plasma glucose level ≥200 mg/dL plus symptoms of hyperglycemia

OR two abnormal results with any of the following tests: A fasting (>8-hour) plasma glucose level ≥126 mg/dL A 2-hour postprandial glucose level ≥200 mg/dL following an oral glucose tolerance test

(OGTT)

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >6.5%

Consider screening for type 2 DM in:

Overweight adults with at least one risk factor for DM (hypertension, cardiovascular disease [CVD], sedentary lifestyle, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS], first-degree relative with DM).

Patients planning pregnancy. Patients on medications that increase risk for DM (chronic steroids, HIV medications,

antipsychotics).

DM older, check HbA1c—if between 5.7 and 6:4, but with impaired on OGTT should also

In all people aged 45 years or older, check HbA1c—if <5.7, recheck every 3 years (unless other risk factors develop). If between 5.7 and 6.4, recheck yearly.

Patients not meeting criteria for DM but with impaired fasting glucose (>100 but <126 mg/dL) or impaired glucose tolerance on OGTT should also be rechecked yearly.

Classification Type I DM is due to destruction of beta cells of the pancreas, which normally produce insulin. This can be secondary to:

Autoimmune disease—characterized by the presence of autoantibodies (anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD], anti-islet cell, anti-zinc transporter, anti-insulin antibodies). Associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3 and HLA-DR4.

Acquired disease—after pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, cystic fibrosis, or malignancy. Idiopathic disease—in the absence of antibodies or recognized destructive disease.

Type II DM is due to relative insulin deficiency in the setting of peripheral insulin resistance, leading to hyperglycemia. More than 90% of DM cases are classified as type 2. Antibodies associated with type 1 DM will be negative.

Other less common etiologies of DM include several genetic defects that affect beta-cell function. For example, several autosomal monogenetic defects have been identified as causes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), which typically presents in young people with a family history of atypical diabetes.

Management Patient education and lifestyle modification are mainstays of management (see Table 2.3-

2).
======================================
TABLE 2.3-2. Diabetes Mellitus General Health Maintenance

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS = RECOMMENDATION Diet Personalized diet to encourage weight loss; avoid saturated fats and added sugars. Exercise Moderate-intensity exercise for 30-60 minutes 5 days per week. Cardiovascular risk modification The presence of diabetes is equivalent to the highest risk for cardio- vascular disease regardless of all other risk factors. All diabetic patients 40-75 years of age should be placed on a statin regardless of lipid levels. Use the AHA risk calculator to determine whether moderate or high-intensity statin is recommended. Blood pressure (BP) management Strict BP control to <130/80 mm Hg; ACEIs/ARBs are first-line agents when proteinuria is present. Screening exams Annual physical exam to screen for cardiovascular disease (BP and lipid monitoring), nephropathy (test for microalbuminuria), retinopathy (dilated-eye exams), and neuropathy (foot care evaluations). Immunizations In addition to routinely recommended immunizations based on age, all patients with diabetes >19 years of age should receive the pneumonia vaccine.

(dilated-eye exams), to routinely recommended patients with diabetes >19 vaccine.

Type 1 DM requires administration of insulin (see Fig. 2.3-2) to maintain blood glucose in the normal range (80–130 mg/dL preprandial levels, <180 mg/dL postprandial levels).

Consider insulin infusion pump for patients with type 1 DM who are having difficulty with intermittent dosing.

Type 2 DM can be managed with nonpharmacologic interventions initially. In the event of failure of lifestyle interventions, a number of medication classes can be considered (see Table 2.3-3).

All patients on insulin should participate in self-monitoring of blood glucose to detect hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia that can be corrected with dose modifications.

Patients with DM should be encouraged to undergo routine HbA1c testing every 3 months. Goal HbA1c <7% (<7.5% in children). Higher blood glucose and HbA1c levels can be tolerated, particularly in the older adult population and in those with multiple medical problems, considering the ↑ risk for hypoglycemia. Tight glucose control decreases the risk for microvascular complications (nephropathy, retinopathy), but the effects on macrovascular complications (stroke, myocardial infarction) and all-cause mortality are

unknown.
======================================
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS AND HYPERGLYCEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR SYNDROME

These are two acute, life-threatening complications of diabetes that are characterized by hyperglycemia with fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Table 2.3-4 outlines the individual characteristics of each.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated levels of ketoacids in serum and urine. Blood glucose level is usually between 250 and 500 mg/dL, but it can be higher.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is characterized by extremely elevated blood glucose (frequently above 800–1000 mg/dL) and plasma hyperosmolality. Generally, there is no ketoacid accumulation and therefore no anion gap acidosis.

Management Treatment of both entities is similar:

Repletion of intravascular volume with infusion of normal saline. Patients with DKA/HHS

are typically very dehydrated due to osmotic diuresis resulting from hyperglycemia. Frequent monitoring of serum electrolytes. Acidosis leads to extracellular shifting of

potassium, which results in “normal” or “elevated” levels on initial labs despite an actual total body deficit. As insulin is infused (and as the acidosis is corrected), potassium shifts back into the intracellular space, leading to frank hypokalemia.

be infused until resolution of DKA/HHS (when anion gap closes and ketoacidosis is resolved in DKA, or until mental status improves to baseline in HHS). If potassium is <3.3mEq/L, insulin should be held and potassium infused until potassium is >3.3 mEq/L). If serum glucose reaches <200 mg/dL before resolution of acidosis (or <250 mg/dL in HHS), 5% dextrose can be administered intravenously to avoid stopping insulin infusion.
======================================
HYPOGLYCEMIA

Symptomatic hypoglycemia is very rare in people who are not on antihyperglycemic medications, even in the presence of a “low” blood sugar (<70 mg/dL). Further evaluation should only be carried out in patients who exhibit Whipple triad:

Symptoms of hypoglycemia (tremor, anxiety, sweating, paresthesia, dizziness, weakness, confusion, loss of consciousness)

A low plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method while symptoms are present

Relief of symptoms after blood glucose is raised

Causes of hypoglycemia include:

Medications (accidental or purposeful antihyperglycemic medication overdose) Critical illness Cortisol insufficiency Insulinoma or non-insulinoma islet cell hypertrophy Recent history of gastric bypass (dumping syndrome)

Q

A 10-year-old boy presents to the emergency department (ED) with 2 weeks of polyuria and polydipsia and new-onset lethargy. Physical examination reveals signs of severe dehydration, and laboratory values reveal a blood glucose level of 500 mg/dL. After being diagnosed with DKA, the patient is started on insulin and non–dextrose-containing intravenous (IV) fluids. Glucose on recheck is 250 mg/dL with an anion gap of 19. What is the next best step in management?

lethargy. Physical examination reveal a blood glucose started on insulin and recheck is 250 mg/dL

Diagnosis Obtaining a detailed history is crucial. Careful questioning can ascertain timing of

symptoms in relation to meals and medication administration. Patients with diabetes who are taking antihyperglycemics should have their medication regimen reviewed and medication doses reduced in cases of persistent hypoglycemia.

If patients report symptoms after prolonged fasting, the physician may order an observed fast with periodic blood sugar assessment. Once symptoms arise, that is the time to obtain serum glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and antihyperglycemic drug screen.

In patients who report symptoms shortly after meals, particularly in those with a history of gastric bypass, mixed-meal testing (consumption of a nonliquid meal with subsequent observation and monitoring of labs) can evaluate for dumping syndrome.

If C-peptide levels are elevated, endogenous insulin is being produced. This is the case with insulin-secreting tumors or islet cell hypertrophy, insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia (in the presence of anti-insulin or anti-insulin receptor antibodies), or insulin secretagogue administration (⊕ drug screen).

If C-peptide levels are low, there is exogenous insulin administration (possibly surreptitiously).

Management After the cause of hypoglycemia is identified, management will be specific to the underlying etiology. Acute or profound hypoglycemia can be life-threatening, and it is most commonly

seen in cases of overdosing of insulin or insulin secretagogues in people with diabetes. Rapid administration of oral or intravenous carbohydrates is the first step in management. In those with altered consciousness and no IV access, administer glucagon (intramuscular, intranasal, or subcutaneous formulations are available).

THYROID DISORDERS

FIGURE 2.3-3. Overview of thyroid synthesis and mechanism of antithyroid medications. Iodide (I−) is taken up from the bloodstream by follicular thyroid cells, transported to the colloid of the follicle, and oxidized to iodine (I). I combines with thyroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Two DIT molecules combine to form T4; MIT and DIT combine to form T3. Iodinated thyroglobulin is transported back to the follicular cells and is cleaved in lysosomes; T4 and T3 are then released into the circulation.

The best initial test to screen for thyroid disease is thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement alone. Suspicion of thyroid disease or detection of a goiter on physical exam should always prompt a check of TSH.

If there is known history (or suspicion) of hypothalamic or pituitary disease, measuring

TSH and free T4 initially can guide more accurate assessment of thyroid function. Total T4 measurement is not an adequate screening test. Ninety-nine percent of T4 is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). Changes in levels of TBG can occur in pregnancy, estrogen administration, and infection.

In general, thyroid function testing should not be done in periods of acute illness, as many

factors (medications, decreased binding protein levels, transient central hypothyroidism) can alter thyroid function tests (TFTs).

TFT patterns seen in selected diseases are included in Table 2.3-5.

The next best step is to add 5% dextrose to the IV fluids. In the management of DKA, it is important to start IV fluids and insulin immediately. Initially, the goal is to rehydrate the patient and ↓ blood glucose, but as blood glucose reaches 250 to 300 mg/dL, it is important to add 5% dextrose to ↓ ↓ the risk for hypoglycemia, as the anion gap acidosis is still being treated.

HYPERTHYROIDISM AND THYROTOXICOSIS

Etiologies include:

Graves disease: Most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Autoimmune—TSH receptor- stimulating autoantibodies ↑ synthesis of T3/T4.

Toxic adenoma/toxic multinodular goiter: Results in hyperthyroidism secondary to autonomous hyperactive thyroid nodules.

Thyroiditis: Caused by transient inflammation of the thyroid gland with release of previously synthesized thyroid hormone; causes a temporary ↑ in circulating T3/T4. A hypothyroid phase may follow the hyperthyroid phase with eventual return to normal in many patients.

Fetal thyrotoxicosis: Classically presents as an irritable, tachycardic infant born to a mother with Graves disease. Due to transplacental transfer of IgG TSH-stimulating antibodies.
======================================
KEY FACT

A

Exophthalmos, pretibial myxedema, and thyroid bruits are specific for Graves disease.

History/PE Patient presents with weight loss, heat intolerance, anxiety, palpitations, ↑ bowel

movement frequency, myopathy/proximal muscle weakness, insomnia, and/or menstrual abnormalities.

Physical examination can reveal warm, moist skin; goiter; hypertension; sinus tachycardia or irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation, other tachyarrhythmias); fine tremor; lid lag; and hyperactive reflexes.

Exophthalmos (direct stimulation of orbital fibroblasts by antibodies), pretibial myxedema, acropachy (soft tissue swelling of the hands) (see Fig. 2.3-5), and thyroid bruits are seen mainly in Graves disease.

FIGURE 2.3-5. Physical signs of Graves disease. (A) Graves ophthalmopathy. (B) Pretibial myxedema. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Untreated long-standing hyperthyroidism can lead to decreased bone mass.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Serum TSH level, followed by free T4 and T3. May need additional

information provided by RAI scans and thyroglobulin levels.

Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) test and scan: Measures degree and distribution of iodine uptake in the thyroid and can be used to differentiate between different causes of hyperthyroidism. Often used to differentiate functioning nodules (toxic adenomas, benign) from nonfunctioning nodules (which require biopsy for malignancy workup). See Figure 2.3-6 and Table 2.3-6.

Treatment β-Blockade is a mainstay of treatment for hyperthyroidism, regardless of the cause. β-

blockers can manage the symptoms of hyperthyroidism caused by increased adrenergic tone (tachycardia, anxiety, tremulousness).

Antithyroid medications inhibit the oxidation of iodide, thus impairing thyroid hormone synthesis. Methimazole is the first-line agent, except during the first trimester of pregnancy, during which propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred (methimazole is teratogenic).

Definitive treatment: Radioactive I-131 thyroid ablation is generally preferred, unless there is a large, obstructive goiter or if there is Graves ophthalmopathy (which can be worsened by radioactive iodine)—the alternative to ablation is thyroidectomy.

Administration of levothyroxine (oral T4 replacement) prevents hypothyroidism in patients who have undergone ablation or surgery.

Administering steroids can treat Graves ophthalmopathy if it is causing diplopia or threatening vision.

See Table 2.3-7 for adverse drug reactions associated with antithyroid medications.
======================================
TABLE 2.3-7. Adverse Reactions and Complications for Thyrotoxicosis Treatments

DRUG/TREATMENT ADVERSE REACTIONS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Methimazole Rash, agranulocytosis, liver dysfunction. Contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy. Propylthiouracil Rash, arthralgias, agranulocytosis, vasculitis, liver failure (black box warning). Preferred agent in first trimester of pregnancy. Radioactive I-131 Most common side effect is subsequent hypothyroidism (most thyroid ablation common when treating patients with Graves disease). Contrain- dicated in pregnancy. Will initially worsen ophthalmopathy. Thyroidectomy Hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, damage to nearby structures (recurrent laryngeal nerve).

Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening form of thyrotoxicosis that may present with tachyarrhythmia, fever, and delirium. It can be precipitated by acute illness, iodine load, or surgery.

It can be essentially consists of.the followed by inhibition of Tj — T3 medications, use of inorganic thyroid hormone. Bile asthyroid hormone is

Treatment of thyroid storm essentially consists of the same measures noted previously, but in rapid order. Begin with β-blockade, followed by antithyroid medication (PTU preferred in this case due to peripheral inhibition of T4 → T3 conversion) and glucocorticoids. After administration of antithyroid medications, use of inorganic iodide (potassium iodide) blocks release and synthesis of thyroid hormone. Bile acid sequestrants (eg, cholestyramine) may be helpful, as thyroid hormone is excreted in bile and reabsorbed in the intestine.

HYPOTHYROIDISM

Most commonly caused by Hashimoto thyroiditis, but it can result from other causes (see Table 2.3-7).

Hashimoto thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism): Associated with ⊕ antithyroglobulin

and antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies that precipitate thyroid destruction. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis have a higher risk of developing thyroid lymphoma. Thyroiditis (postpartum, postviral, subacute/de Quervain): Can have a hypothyroid phase

that follows the hyperthyroid phase.

Secondary hypothyroidism: Caused by pituitary tumors or pituitary surgery. Congenital hypothyroidism: Most common etiology is thyroid dysgenesis. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone: Rare. Elevated T3/T4, normal to elevated TSH.

History/PE Hypothyroidism classically presents with weakness, fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation,

weight gain, depression, hair loss, menstrual irregularities, and myopathy.

Exam reveals dry, cold, puffy skin accompanied by edema, bradycardia, and delayed

relaxation of deep tendon reflexes.

umbilicus, Pale, Puffy-faced, Protuberant tongue, and Poor brain development. Jaundice (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) and enlarged fontanelles can also be seen. Features of hypothyroidism arise over the first few months of life, since maternal T4 crosses the placenta, providing somewhat adequate hormone levels at the time of birth.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Serum TSH level, followed by free T4 levels (see Table 2.3-5). Other common lab abnormalities include high LDL, ↑ triglycerides, ↑ creatine kinase (CK), and hyponatremia.

Treatment For frank hypothyroidism, administer levothyroxine. In subclinical hypothyroidism (↑

TSH, normal T4), treat with levothyroxine if TSH >10 mU/L.

Myxedema coma is a state of severe hypothyroidism that can present with ↓ mental status, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and hypoventilation. Mortality is 30% to 60%. Myxedema coma can be triggered in a hypothyroid patient by acute events such as infections, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, trauma, sedative drugs, surgery, and medication nonadherence.

To treat myxedema coma, admit to the intensive care unit (ICU) and urgently administer intravenous IV levothyroxine and IV hydrocortisone (unless adrenal insufficiency has already been excluded).

to the intensive care IV hydrocortisone Common subtypes infectious,
======================================
THYROIDITIS

Inflammation of the thyroid gland. Common subtypes include subacute granulomatous, radiation-induced, autoimmune, postpartum, infectious, and drug-induced (eg, amiodarone).

History/PE The subacute form presents with a tender thyroid, usually after an upper respiratory tract

infection.

All other forms are associated with painless goiter.

Diagnosis Thyroid dysfunction (typically thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism), with ↓ uptake on RAI scan during the hyperthyroid phase.

Treatment Subacute thyroiditis is usually self-limited. Treatment calls for nonsteroidal anti-

inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral prednisone for pain control.

β-Blockers are appropriate for treating symptomatic hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medications are generally not indicated. Levothyroxine is suitable for management of hypothyroidism associated with thyroiditis if TSH >10 mU/L.

Q

A 24-year-old woman with hypothyroidism presents at 10 weeks’ gestation for a prenatal visit. Her only medication is levothyroxine. What adjustment is probably needed to her levothyroxine dose?

THYROID NEOPLASMS

Thyroid nodules are very common and show an ↑ incidence with age. Most (~95%) are benign.

History/PE Usually asymptomatic on initial presentation; discovered incidentally. Hyperfunctioning nodules may present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Large nodules adjacent to the trachea/esophagus may cause dysphagia, dyspnea, cough,

and choking sensation.

An ↑ risk for malignancy is associated with a history of childhood neck irradiation, “cold” nodules (minimal uptake on RAI scan), female sex, age <20 or >70, firm and fixed solitary nodules, ⊕ family history, and rapidly growing nodules with hoarseness. Hyperfunctioning (“hot”) nodules are typically benign.

Diagnosis and Management See Figure 2.3-7 for a diagnostic workup of thyroid nodules.

Benign nodules: Physical exam/ultrasonography can assess for continued nodule growth

or for development of suspicious characteristics (eg, microcalcifications, ↑ vascular flow, nodules that are taller than they are wide).

Malignant nodules: Surgical resection with hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy is best initial treatment; adjunctive radioiodine ablation following excision is appropriate for some high-risk patients.

Indeterminate fine-needle aspiration (FNA): Initial management can be watchful waiting vs hemithyroidectomy (10%–30% chance of malignancy). If resected, final pathology can guide further treatment. Table 2.3-8 summarizes the types of thyroid malignancy that can be diagnosed after

biopsy.

======================================
OSTEOPOROSIS

A common metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass. It most often affects thin postmenopausal females, especially those of White or Asian ethnicity or descent, with risk doubling after 65 years of age. Males are also at risk for osteoporosis, but the diagnosis is often overlooked.

KEY FACT

Do not confuse osteoporosis with osteomalacia—a mineralization defect often caused by severe vitamin D deficiency that presents with bone pain, ↓ calcium/phosphate, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

History/PE Osteoporosis is commonly asymptomatic even in the presence of a vertebral fracture. Risk factors include smoking, advancing age, excessive alcohol intake, a history of estrogen-depleting conditions in women (eg, amenorrhea, eating disorders, early menopause) or hypogonadism in men, physical inactivity, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, chronic inflammatory disease, corticosteroid use, and Cushing syndrome.

Exam may reveal hip fractures, vertebral compression fractures (loss of height and progressive thoracic kyphosis), and/or distal radius fractures (Colles fracture) following minimal trauma (see Fig. 2.3-9).

FIGURE 2.3-9. Radiographic findings in osteoporosis. Lateral thoracic spine radiograph shows osteoporosis and an anterior wedge deformity (red arrow) of a lower thoracic vertebral body with associated kyphosis.

Diagnosis Diagnostic test: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is the recommended screening test for all women >65 years of age and men >70 years of age and those with other risk factors for osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis: Bone mineral density (T-score) is 2.5 standard deviations (SDs) less than normal.

Osteopenia: T-score is between 1 and 2.5 SDs below normal.

phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), TSH, free T4, liver enzymes, creatinine, and electrolytes. If estrogen deficiency or hypogonadism is suspected, laboratory tests should include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and testosterone.
======================================
KEY FACT

Osteoporosis is the most common cause of pathologic fractures in women with low body weight and men >60 years of age.

Treatment Lifestyle modifications: Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake (supplementation can be used for prevention), smoking cessation, avoiding heavy alcohol use, and weight-bearing exercises.

Best initial treatment: Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid) used in the treatment of osteoporosis; treatment also offered to individuals with osteopenia who have a high calculated osteoporotic fracture risk based on the FRAX calculator.

Other medications: Teriparatide (PTH analogue), denosumab (a monoclonal antibody to RANK-L), and selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, raloxifene).

Complications Hip fracture is the most devastating consequence of low bone mineral density/osteoporosis, carrying a 50% ↑ in mortality in the year following hip fracture.

KEY FACT

Upper gastrointestinal side effects such as reflux, esophagitis, and esophageal ulcers are common reasons for oral bisphosphonate (alendronate and risedronate) intolerance.

PAGET DISEASE OF BONE

Characterized by an ↑ rate of bone turnover with both excessive resorption and formation of bone. Suspected to be caused by the effects of latent viral infection in genetically susceptible individuals. Associated with primary hyperparathyroidism and ↑ risk for osteosarcoma. The disease can affect one (monostotic) or more (polyostotic) bones, with the skull, vertebral bodies, pelvis, and long bones most commonly affected.

KEY FACT

Increased serum alkaline phosphatase with normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) points to bone etiology, not liver etiology, as the cause of elevation.

History/PE Usually asymptomatic. May present with aching bone or joint pain, bony deformities, fracture at a pagetoid site, nerve entrapment, headaches, and hearing loss (latter two occur if involving the skull).

MNEMONIC

(Reproduced with permission from Takigami I, et al. Functional bracing for delayed union of a femur fracture associated with Paget’s disease of the bone in an Asian patient: a case report. J Orthop Surg Res. 2010;5:33.)

Lab values: ↑ serum alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphate levels. Must be distinguished from metastatic bone disease.

Treatment Most patients are asymptomatic and require no treatment. There is no curative treatment, but the goal is to reduce pain and disease progression.

Pharmacologic: Bisphosphonates (first line), calcitonin (if intolerant to bisphosphonates), calcium and vitamin D supplementation, analgesics (NSAIDs and acetaminophen).

Adjunctive therapy: Physiotherapy, occupational therapy. Surgery: If necessary, such as in the case of fractures, severe deformities, and

osteoarthritis.

Complications Osteoarthritis, pathologic fractures, high-output cardiac failure (from atrioventricular [AV] connections), and osteosarcoma (up to 1%).
======================================
KEY FACT

Bone pain and hearing loss → think Paget disease.

HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

See Figure 2.3-8 for the effects of PTH on serum calcium and phosphate regulation. For a more thorough review of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia, see the Renal/Genitourinary chapter.

Most cases (80%) resulting from parathyroid A physiologic t of of 1-25 dihydroxy Seen in patients on which leads to

Primary hyperparathyroidism: Most cases (80%) caused by a single hyperfunctioning adenoma, with the rest (15%) resulting from parathyroid hyperplasia and, rarely (5%), parathyroid carcinoma.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism: A physiologic ↑ of PTH in response to renal insufficiency (caused by ↓ production of 1-25 dihydroxy vitamin D), calcium deficiency, or vitamin D deficiency.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism: Seen in patients on dialysis with long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, which leads to hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands. When one or more of the glands become autonomous, tertiary hyperparathyroidism results.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism: PTH resistance. ↑ PTH levels but ineffective at target organs, resulting in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Associated with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (may have shortened fourth and fifth metatarsal or metacarpal bones).

History/PE Most cases of primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic but may show signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia (see Renal/Genitourinary chapter).

KEY FACT

Hypercalcemia is associated with “stones, bones, moans, groans, and psychiatric overtones.” Treatment: IV fluids (first-line treatment) and calcitonin. If secondary to malignancy, add bisphosphonates.

Diagnosis Lab results in primary hyperparathyroidism reveal hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and

hypercalciuria. Intact PTH is inappropriately ↑ relative to total and ionized calcium (see Table 2.3-9).

DEXA may reveal low bone mineral density or frank osteoporosis in the distal radius or other sites.

nephrocalcinosis and include iatrogenic (hemochromatosis, Wilson)

Renal imaging can look for nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis.
======================================
KEY FACT

Etiologies of hypoparathyroidism include iatrogenic (postsurgical), autoimmune, congenital (DiGeorge), and infiltrative (hemochromatosis, Wilson) diseases.

Treatment Best initial treatment: For acute hypercalcemia, IV fluids and calcitonin. IV

bisphosphonates suitable for long-term treatment.

Parathyroidectomy if the patient is symptomatic or if certain criteria are met (↑ ↑ calcium, ↑ creatinine, ↓ bone mineral density, <50 years of age). In the case of a solitary adenoma, 1 gland can be removed. In the setting of hyperplasia, 3.5 glands must be removed.

In patients with chronic kidney disease, oral phosphate binders (calcium salts, sevelamer hydrochloride, and lanthanum carbonate) and restriction of dietary phosphate intake to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Cinacalcet—a calcimimetic that acts to lower serum PTH levels—approved for use in hyperparathyroidism caused by renal failure or in patients who cannot undergo surgery.

Complications Hypercalcemia is the most severe complication of primary hyperparathyroidism. Following parathyroidectomy, the physician should watch for hungry bone syndrome (severe and prolonged hypocalcemia caused by acute reversal of PTH and ↑ in bone uptake of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium).

KEY FACT

Hyperparathyroidism can be caused by ectopic PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) production, particularly from carcinomas of the breast, lung, and head and neck.

PITUITARY AND HYPOTHALAMIC DISORDERS

======================================
DEFICIENCY OF PITUITARY HORMONES

Hypopituitarism is the deficiency of anterior pituitary hormones. If the posterior pituitary hormones are also affected, it is known as panhypopituitarism. Common causes include:

Damage to pituitary gland/hypothalamus by surgery, radiation, mass lesions (tumors such as a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma)

Sheehan syndrome (pituitary infarction seen in severe hemorrhage, classically in postpartum patients)

Pituitary apoplexy (hemorrhage) Infiltrative disorders (hemochromatosis) Infections

Q

An asymptomatic 36-year-old man presents for his annual physical. Routine labs reveal a serum calcium level of 11.3 mg/dL. He returns in 2 weeks, and his serum calcium level remains elevated. Additional studies show a normal serum PTH level and a low 24-hour urinary calcium level. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Gonadotropins and growth hormone are often affected first; consequently, children first present with growth retardation, and adults present with hypogonadism. Pituitary hormone deficiencies include adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency, secondary

hypothyroidism, growth hormone (GH) deficiency, gonadotropin deficiency, central diabetes insipidus (DI), and prolactin deficiency.

History/PE See Table 2.3-10 for a presentation of pituitary hormone deficiencies. Clinical manifestations may present suddenly (apoplexy, Sheehan syndrome) or gradually (radiation, infiltrative diseases).

Diagnosis Routine hypopituitarism testing includes 8 am cortisol (on at least two separate occasions), free T4 (TSH is not diagnostic), testosterone/estradiol levels, urine, and plasma osmolality. After the diagnosis of a pituitary hormone deficiency, a brain MRI can check for underlying causes. (See Table 2.3-10.)

Treatment Hormone replacement therapy and treatment of the underlying disorder. Corresponding sections outline treatments of specific hormone deficiencies.
======================================
KEY FACT

In patients with suspected DI, check serum or urinary glucose to rule out diabetes mellitus.

DIABETES INSIPIDUS

Inability to produce concentrated urine as a result of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) dysfunction, resulting in free water loss from the kidneys. The two subtypes of diabetes insipidus (DI) are as follows:

Central DI (ADH deficiency): The posterior pituitary gland fails to secrete ADH. Causes include tumor, ischemia (Sheehan syndrome), pituitary hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, infection, metastatic disease, and autoimmune disorders (see Fig. 2.3-13).

FIGURE 2.3-13. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis: Diabetes insipidus. In central DI, ADH is not secreted from the posterior hypothalamus. In nephrogenic DI, ADH is secreted from the posterior hypothalamus, but its end-organ effects at the kidney are blocked. Both central and nephrogenic DI result in an increase in plasma osmolarity due to excessive free-water diuresis. DI, Diabetes insipidus; SIADH, syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Nephrogenic DI (ADH resistance): The kidneys fail to respond to circulating ADH. Causes include renal disease and drugs (eg, lithium, demeclocycline).

The patient most likely has familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), an inherited disorder caused by mutations in a calcium-sensing receptor present in the parathyroid and kidney, which presents with elevated serum calcium levels. Unlike patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, these patients are asymptomatic and have low urinary calcium levels. No treatment is required.

History/PE DI presents with polydipsia, polyuria, and persistent thirst with dilute urine.

A

If access to water is limited (eg, in people who are institutionalized or older adults), patients may present with dehydration and severe hypernatremia, which lead to altered mental status, lethargy, seizures, and coma.

Diagnosis Lab tests: Serum osmolality > urine osmolality, ↓ urinary sodium, and possible

hypernatremia.
======================================
Q

A 23-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia presents with complaints of fatigue, weakness, cramps, and headache for the past several days. He denies any other symptoms, although he had to urinate several times while in the office. Routine labs reveal hyponatremia. With water deprivation, his urine osmolality ↑. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Water deprivation test: In psychogenic polydipsia and normal renal physiology, water restriction will lead to more concentrated urine. In central and nephrogenic DI, patients excrete a high volume of inappropriately dilute urine (see Fig. 2.3-14, Table 2.3-11).

History/PE Pituitary adenoma may cause headache, cranial nerve defects, and bitemporal hemianopsia

due to compression of the optic chiasm.

Systemic manifestations include:

Increased skeletal and soft tissue growth manifesting as enlargement of the skull (frontal bossing, wide-spaced teeth) and hands and feet, malocclusion of the jaw, coarsening of facial features, and carpal tunnel syndrome

Degeneration of cartilage resembling osteoarthritis Skin thickening and skin tags Hyperhidrosis Organomegaly (eg, tongue enlargement)

Associated with an increased risk for:

Obstructive sleep apnea

Cardiovascular abnormalities such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction (most common cause of death)

Type 2 DM Diverticulosis Colon cancer

Diagnosis Lab tests: Levels of IGF-1 increase with acromegaly; diagnosis can be confirmed with an

oral glucose suppression test (GH levels will remain elevated despite glucose administration). Baseline GH is not a reliable test, as GH levels fluctuate widely throughout the day (see Fig. 2.3-16).

Imaging: MRI shows a sellar lesion.

Treatment Surgery: Trans-sphenoidal surgical resection. Medical therapy: Octreotide or lanreotide (somatostatin analogues) to suppress GH

secretion; pegvisomant (a GH receptor antagonist) to block the peripheral actions of GH.

Radiation: Effective when surgical and medical therapies fail.
======================================
KEY FACT

Measurement of IGF-1 levels—not GH levels—can confirm acromegaly!

HYPERPROLACTINEMIA

Hyperprolactinemia refers to elevated prolactin levels, most commonly caused by a pituitary adenoma (see Fig. 2.3-17). Prolactinoma is the most common functioning pituitary tumor. Other causes include physiologic ones (pregnancy, lactation); pituitary stalk compression from other masses (eg, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, nonsecreting pituitary tumor); hypothalamic dysfunction; drugs (eg, dopamine antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]); and systemic conditions such as renal failure, cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism.

(Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

History/PE Elevated prolactin inhibits GnRH secretion and consequently lowers LH and FSH secretion, manifesting as infertility, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, and amenorrhea. Bitemporal hemianopsia may also be present.

KEY FACT

Rule out pregnancy in all cases of hyperprolactinemia!

Diagnosis Serum prolactin level is typically >200 ng/mL. Pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy. MRI shows a sellar lesion.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline, bromocriptine).

Trans-sphenoidal surgery: Indicated in adenomas refractory to medical management or with compressive effects (eg, visual loss).

Radiation: Rarely indicated.

SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE SECRETION

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common cause of euvolemic hyponatremia that results from persistent ADH release independent of serum osmolality.

History/PE May be associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease (eg, head injury, tumor), pulmonary disease (eg, sarcoid, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], pneumonia), ectopic tumor production/paraneoplastic syndrome (eg, small cell lung carcinoma), and drugs (eg, antipsychotics, antidepressants, NSAIDs). Euvolemic on physical exam.

Diagnosis Serum osmolality <280 mOsm/kg (hypotonic) Urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg in the setting of serum hypo-osmolarity without a physiologic reason for ↑ ADH (eg, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, hypovolemia)

congestive heart mEq/L underlying cause of fluid hyponatremia (<120

Urinary sodium level often ≥40 mEq/L

Treatment Exploration of and addressing the underlying cause Best initial treatment: Restriction of fluid Persistent or symptomatic hyponatremia (<120 mEq/L): IV hypertonic saline therapy Severe SIADH: ADH antagonists (eg, tolvaptan, conivaptan) Chronic SIADH: Demeclocycline
======================================
KEY FACT

Fluid restriction is the cornerstone of SIADH treatment. Hyponatremia should be corrected slowly to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.

ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY

of adrenal hormones, be primary, secondary, most commonly caused Other Causes include deficiencies, and

Manifested by an inadequate production of adrenal hormones, including glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids, AI may be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Etiologies are as follows:

Primary: In the United States, most commonly caused by autoimmune adrenal cortical destruction (Addison disease). Other causes include infections (tuberculosis [TB], HIV, histoplasmosis), congenital enzyme deficiencies, and adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse- Friderichsen syndrome from Neisseria meningitidis).

Secondary/tertiary: Caused by ↓ ACTH production by the pituitary gland (secondary) or ↓ CRH corticotropin-releasing hormone production by the hypothalamus (tertiary); most often caused by cessation of long-term glucocorticoid treatment (often with higher doses and longer duration of therapy).

KEY FACT

Primary AI is associated with ↑ skin pigmentation, ↓ glucocorticoids, and ↓ mineralocorticoids. Secondary AI is only associated with ↓ glucocorticoids and does not have skin pigmentation or hyperkalemia.

History/PE Most symptoms are nonspecific. Common concerns include weakness, fatigue, anorexia with weight loss, and GI

complaints (eg, nausea, abdominal pain).

Hyperpigmentation (caused by ↑ ACTH secretion) and non–anion gap metabolic acidosis (caused by ↓ aldosterone) occur in primary AI. Hyperpigmentation is not seen in secondary or tertiary AI due to a decrease in ACTH secretion.

Hypotension, confusion, and coma are seen in acute adrenal crisis (eg, stopping long-term

steroids).

If morning cortisol levels are nondiagnostic, the test of choice is synthetic ACTH stimulation (cosyntropin) test. Failure of cortisol to rise >20 μg/dL following ACTH administration confirms the diagnosis.

KEY FACT

Do not delay the administration of steroids for diagnostic testing in a patient with suspected AI.

Treatment Primary: Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement Secondary/tertiary: Only glucocorticoid replacement necessary (mineralocorticoid

production is not ACTH dependent)

Acute adrenal crisis: IV steroids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, 50% dextrose to correct hypoglycemia, and initiation of aggressive volume resuscitation

Prevention ↑ steroids during periods of stress (eg, major surgery, trauma, infection). In patients on chronic steroid therapy, taper slowly to prevent secondary/tertiary AI.

History/PE Pheochromocytoma presents with paroxysmal tachycardia, palpitations, chest pain,

diaphoresis, episodic or persistent hypertension, headache, tremor, anxiety, pallor, and weight loss. It may be misdiagnosed as anxiety/panic disorder.

Obtaining a family history can rule out genetic causes of pheochromocytoma (eg, MEN2A/2B, von Hippel–Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1).

Diagnosis Best initial test: Indicated by ↑ 24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines or

plasma-fractionated metanephrines.

Helpful labs: Hyperglycemia ± polycythemia (if EPO secreted). Imaging (only after labs): CT or MRI of adrenal glands (see Fig. 2.3-20). A nuclear

metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan can localize extra-adrenal lesions and metastatic disease.

Treatment Surgical resection. Preoperatively, first α-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine) to control hypertension, followed by β-blockade to control tachycardia. β-Blockade should never be given first, as unopposed α-adrenergic–mediated vasoconstriction can lead to severe hypertension.

If bilateral adrenalectomy, glucocorticoids to prevent acute adrenal insufficiency.

KEY FACT

In pheochromocytoma, administration of α-blockers should occur before β-blockers to prevent hypertensive crisis.
======================================
CUSHING SYNDROME

Cushing syndrome is caused by elevated serum cortisol levels, and it most frequently develops secondary to prolonged treatment with exogenous corticosteroids. The most common endogenous cause is hypersecretion of ACTH from a pituitary adenoma (known as Cushing disease; see Fig. 2.3-21). Other endogenous causes include excess adrenal secretion of cortisol (eg, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal adenoma, adrenal cancer) and ectopic

ACTH production from an occult neoplasm (eg, carcinoid tumor, medullary thyroid cancer, small cell lung cancer).

KEY FACT

In Cushing disease, cortisol secretion remains elevated with the low-dose (1 mg) dexamethasone test but is suppressed with the high-dose (8 mg) dexamethasone test.

Treatment Exogenous: Gradual withdrawal and stoppage of glucocorticoids. Endogenous: Surgical resection of the source (pituitary, adrenal, ectopic neoplasm). Permanent hormone replacement therapy to correct deficiencies after treatment or resection of the primary lesion.

HYPERALDOSTERONISM

Hyperaldosteronism results from excessive secretion of aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. It is usually caused by bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia (60%–70%) but can also result from unilateral adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome).

History/PE Presents with hypertension, headache, polyuria, muscle weakness (caused by hypokalemia), and constipation/paralytic ileus (particularly if hypokalemia).

Consider hyperaldosteronism in younger adults who are diagnosed with hypertension without risk factors or a family history of hypertension.

Diagnosis Lab tests: Can confirm 1º hyperaldosteronism with ↑ urinary aldosterone after oral sodium loading or saline infusion test (ie, failure to suppress aldosterone secretion). Hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hyperaldosteronism, ↑↑ aldosterone- to-plasma renin activity ratio (usually >30).

hyperaldosteronism with 1 test (ie, failure to hypomagnesemia, (usually >30). MRI may reveal an show 1, aldosterone) may adrenal hyperplasia.

Imaging: Only after labs. CT or MRI may reveal an adrenal mass. Adrenal venous sampling (will show ↑ aldosterone) may be needed to localize the

adenoma or to confirm bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.

Treatment Unilateral adenoma: Surgical resection (after correction of BP and potassium). Bilateral hyperplasia: Aldosterone receptor antagonist (eg, spironolactone). Switch to

eplerenone if side effects.

Q

An asymptomatic 36-year-old woman presents with a 2 cm thyroid mass. TFTs are unremarkable, but FNA reveals medullary carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy with thyroid hormone replacement is recommended. What are the most important screening tests to perform prior to surgery?

CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to genetic enzyme defects that impair cortisol synthesis, resulting in glucocorticoid insufficiency and buildup of precursors. Most cases are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (95%, autosomal recessive), but other causes include 11- and 17-hydroxylase deficiencies.

MNEMONIC

For CAH, if the deficient enzyme begins with 1 (11 and 17), mineralocorticoid activity is high. If it ends with 1 (11 and 21), androgen activity is high.

History/PE See Table 2.3-14.

Elevated serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is diagnostic of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Treatment Immediate fluid resuscitation and salt repletion. Administer cortisol to ↓ ACTH and

adrenal androgens. Fludrocortisone is appropriate for severe 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Possible surgical correction of ambiguous genitalia. Refer to the Gynecology chapter for information on the diagnosis and treatment of late-

onset CAH.

KEY FACT

Congenital aromatase deficiency will present similarly to CAH in female newborns with external virilization and ambiguous external genitalia. However, the patient will have no electrolyte or blood pressure abnormalities.

A

The most important screening tests to perform are vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and metanephrines. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is associated with MEN type 2A/2B, an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes patients not only to medullary carcinoma but also to pheochromocytomas. Screening for pheochromocytoma with urine VMA and metanephrines prior to surgery can prevent potentially life-threatening hypertensive crises during thyroidectomy.

ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE FREQUENCY

The prevalence of a disease is the number of existing cases in the population at a specific moment in time.

total number of cases in the population at one point in time a total population

The incidence of a disease is the number of new cases in the disease-free population (“population at risk”) that develop over a period of time.

Incid number of new cases in the population over a given time period icidence = —K——_— 1 total population at risk during the specified time period

KEY FACT

As the mortality of a disease ↓, the prevalence of that disease ↑ (eg, type 2 diabetes mellitus), because the duration of disease has lengthened. Remember: P = I × D.

KEY FACT

Incidence can be measured in a cohort study; prevalence can be measured in a cross- sectional study.

Prevalence is directly related to incidence and duration of disease. It is given by the following formula:

Prevalence (P) = incidence (I) × average duration of disease (D)

For example, a chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is diagnosed frequently, but due to improvements in treatment, people live longer with this disease. Thus the prevalence of type 2 DM increases daily as more people are diagnosed and more people with the disease live for a longer period.

in treatment, people daily as more-people period. any preexisting are:no longer at risk. ESTIMATE

For incidence, remember to subtract any preexisting cases of the disease from the total population at risk, as these individuals are no longer at risk.

PERSON-TIME ESTIMATE

To further estimate the actual time at risk that all patients contributed to a study, a person- time estimate is calculated. This is relevant in cohort studies, as this considers when a person enters the study, leaves the study, or develops disease by taking into consideration four major end points: presence of disease at the onset of the study, death of the subject being studied, loss to follow-up, and end of the study.
======================================
ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY

Physicians often use tests to narrow and confirm possible diagnoses. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests allow physicians to determine how often false ⊕ and false ⊖ results occur (Fig. 2.4-1). Both sensitivity and specificity are independent of disease prevalence.

Disease PPV a © ie ia =TP/(TP + FP) r l i) NPV © uN = TN/(TN + FN) ] Sensitivity | Specificity | Prevalence | + =TP/(TP + FN) | =TN/(TN + FP) | (TP + FN +FP + TN)

FIGURE 2.4-1. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Presence or absence of disease is typically assessed using a “gold standard” test, or the most accurate test available for a given disease. TP, true positive; FP, false positive; FN, false negative; TN, true negative. (Reproduced with permission USMLE-Rx.com.)

Sensitivity: The probability that a patient with a disease will have a ⊕ test result.

A sensitive test rarely misses identifying people with the disease and is therefore good at ruling out those who do not have the disease. A high sensitivity means there is a low false ⊖ rate.

High sensitivity is desirable early in a diagnostic workup or screening test, when it is necessary to reduce a broad differential diagnosis.

Example: An initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV infection.

1 — sensitivity = disease.

False ⊖ rate = 1 – sensitivity = 1 – (TP/[TP + FN])   MNEMONIC  SNOUT—SeNsitive tests rule OUT disease. SPIN—SPecific tests rule IN disease. 

Specificity: The probability that a patient without a disease will have a ⊖ test result.

A specific test rarely determines that someone has the disease when they do not and is therefore good at ruling in those who have the disease. A high specificity means there is a low false ⊕ rate.

High specificity is desirable when confirming a likely diagnosis.↑ specificity ↓ the number of false ⊕ results.

Example: A Western blot confirmatory HIV test.

False ⊕ rate = 1 – specificity = 1 – (TN/[TN + FP])

The ideal test is both sensitive and specific, but a trade-off must often be made between sensitivity and specificity (Fig. 2.4-2). For a given test, when sensitivity ↑, specificity ↓ (and vice versa).

Possible cutoff values for @) vs O test result A = 100% sensitivity cutoff value B = practical compromise between specificity and sensitivity C = 100% specificity cutoff value Disease Disease absent oS of present Number of people pane the cutoff value: T Sensitivity T NPV B-A(TFP | FN) + Specificity) PPV FN | FP 7% =e : Raising the cutoff value: — T Specificity T PPV A B c B->C(TFN FP) 1 Sensitivity | NPV Test results

FIGURE 2.4-2. Effect of cutoff values on sensitivity and specificity. FN, False negative; FP, false positive; TN, true negative; TP, true positive. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Occasionally, the USMLE asks students to compare different diagnostic tests using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, where sensitivity is plotted on the y-axis and 1 – specificity is plotted on the x-axis (Fig. 2.4-3). The best diagnostic test will have a curve that “hugs” the x- and y-axes (curve X).

__ FPrate(1- specificity) characteristic curves.

FIGURE 2.4-3. Receiver operating characteristic curves. The better performing test will have a higher AUC, with the curve closer to the upper left corner. (Reproduced with permission of USMLE- Rx.com.)

What happens to the PPV and NPV when prevalence ↓?

A local child care center that was built before the 1950s was found to have elevated lead levels in its paint. A student organization at your medical school is hosting a lead-screening event to test all children at the center. Which initial screening test would be more appropriate: a test that has high sensitivity or one that has high specificity?
======================================
Q 3

Your hospital is considering adopting a new diagnostic test for pheochromocytoma. In Figure 2.4-2, the current diagnostic test (urinary metanephrines) falls close to point B. The new test falls closer to point A. How will the false ⊕ and false ⊖ rates of this new test

compare to urinary metanephrines?

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUES

Once a test has been administered and a patient’s result has been made available, that result must be interpreted through use of predictive values. Remember, unlike sensitivity and specificity, which refer to test characteristics, PPV and NPV depend both on the test characteristics and the underlying disease prevalence. PPV: The probability that a patient with a ⊕ test result truly has the disease. The higher the disease prevalence, the higher the PPV of the test for that disease. A change in the test cutoff point that ↑ false ⊕ will ↓ the PPV. This means that with an increase in the specificity of the test, there is an increase in the PPV, and vice versa.

NPV: The probability that a patient with a ⊖ test result truly does not have the disease. The lower the disease prevalence, the higher the NPV of the test for that disease. A change in the test cutoff point that ↑ false ⊖ will ↓ the NPV. This means that with an increase in the sensitivity of a test, there is an increase in the NPV, and vice versa.

LIKELIHOOD RATIO

The likelihood ratio (LR) expresses the extent to which a given test result is likely in diseased people as opposed to people without disease: LR ⊕ shows how much the odds (or probability) of disease are ↑ if the test result is ⊕. LR ⊖ shows how much the odds (or probability) of disease are ↓ if the test result is ⊖.

disease: (or probability) of disease (or probability) of disease sensitivity/(1 — = (1-—sensitivity)/specificity

LR⊕ = sensitivity/(1 − specificity)  LR⊖ = (1 − sensitivity)/specificity  Posttest odds = pretest odds × LR 

1 A

PPV ↓ and NPV ↑. Remember that if prevalence is low, even a test with high sensitivity or specificity will have a low PPV.
======================================
2 A

A test with high sensitivity, such as a fingerstick lead test (capillary blood), is preferred for initial screening because it can ensure that no children who might have the disease—and who might benefit from further testing and treatment—will be missed. The children with a ⊕ fingerstick test should subsequently have a serum blood level drawn (higher specificity).

3 A

The false ⊕ rate will ↑ (capturing more of the “no disease” cohort), but the false ⊖ rate will ↓ (capturing the little tail of the “disease” cohort). In Fig. 2.4-2, this translates to ↑ sensitivity and ↓ specificity.

MEASURES OF EFFECT

A central aim of epidemiology is to assess the relationship between an exposure event and an outcome measure. The likelihood or risk of observing an outcome following an exposure is quantified using measures of effect. Ways to express and compare risk include the following: Absolute risk: The incidence of disease. Relative risk (or risk ratio; RR): Expresses how much more likely an exposed person is

to get the disease in comparison to an unexposed person. This indicates the relative strength of the association between exposure and disease, making it useful when one is considering disease etiology. This is used mostly in cohort studies.

incidence in exposed RR = i incidence in unexposed

RR > 1 suggests ↑ risk

RR < 1 suggests ↓ risk

Attributable risk (or risk difference): The difference in risk between exposed and unexposed groups.

of disease inexposed percentage = [(RR — The difference in risk control.,.From the 2 x 2 table

unexposed groups.

Attributable risk = (incidence of disease in exposed − incidence in unexposed)

Attributable risk percentage = [(RR − 1)/RR] × 100%

Absolute risk reduction (ARR): The difference in risk that is attributable to the intervention compared to a control. From the 2 × 2 table (see example in Fig. 2.4-4), ARR is derived as:

Disease No develops disease _a/(atb) Absolute risk =(a+c)/(a+b+c+d) Exposure | a |b R= cl(c+d) Attributable risk = a/(a+b)—c/ (c+) No exposure LL axns OR =ad / be Number needed to treat = 1/ARR
======================================
FIGURE 2.4-4. Relative risk (RR) vs odds ratio (OR). (Adapted with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

ARR = (c/[c + d]) – (a/[a + b])

Number needed to treat (NNT): Number of individuals who need to be treated for one patient to benefit.

NNT = 1/absolute risk reduction

represents the odds of exposure among cases vs odds of exposure among controls. The OR tells how much more likely it is that a person with a disease has been exposed to a risk factor than someone without the disease. The lower the disease prevalence, the more closely it approximates RR. In case-control studies, the OR also describes how many

times more likely an exposed individual is to have disease compared to an unexposed individual (see Fig. 2.4-4).

odds that a diseased person is exposed odds that a nondiseased person is exposed

Once a diagnosis has been established, it is important to be able to describe the associated prognosis. Survival analysis is used to summarize the average time from one event (eg, presentation, diagnosis, or start of treatment) to any outcome that can occur only once during follow-up (eg, death or recurrence of cancer). The usual method is with a Kaplan-Meier curve (Fig. 2.4-5) describing the survival in a cohort of patients, with the probability of survival ↓ over time as patients die or drop out from the study.

TYPES OF CLINICAL STUDIES

Studies are typically used to evaluate diagnosis, treatment, and screening for a disease. Although the gold standard for such evaluation is a randomized, double-blind controlled trial, other types of studies may be used as well (eg, an observational study, in which the exposure in question is a therapeutic intervention). Figure 2.4-6 illustrates the level of evidence pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid are low level of evidence studies, and at the top of the pyramid are high level of evidence studies. In descending order of strength of evidence, published studies regarding treatment options include randomized controlled trials (RCTs); observational studies like case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies; and case series/case reports. Meta-analyses are often used to systematically synthesize information across studies to help summarize the totality of the evidence. Randomization is successful when the baseline characteristics of patients in each group are statistically similar.

CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY

A cross-sectional study is an observational study that assesses risk factors and outcomes at a snapshot in time (Fig. 2.4-7). This study does not prove temporal relationships because it measures correlation, not causation. The most common example of this type of study would be a general survey or a census.

======================================
KEY FACT

A cross-sectional study that is undertaken to estimate prevalence is called a prevalence study.

Advantages of cross-sectional studies include the following:

include the of examining a population, disorder and those without testing. information at

They provide an efficient means of examining a population, allowing simultaneous assessment of people with the disorder and those without it.

They can give a basis for diagnostic testing.

Disadvantages include the following:

Cross-sectional studies only obtain information at a single point in time, so researchers cannot determine causal relationships.

Risk or incidence of disease cannot be directly measured.

OR = ad/bc = (283 × 210)/(263 × 182) = 1.24 Interpretation: The exposed group had 1.24 times the odds of having disease compared to the unexposed group.

COHORT STUDY

In a cohort study, a group of people sharing certain characteristics (eg, age, gender, occupation, or date of birth) is assembled to study the relationships between exposures and outcomes of interest (see Fig. 2.4-7). For each possible risk factor, the members of the cohort are classified as either exposed or unexposed. All the cohort members are then followed over time, and the incidence of outcome events is compared in the two exposure groups.

Example: The Framingham Heart Study followed a group of men and women over time to see how different exposures (eg, diet, exercise, aspirin) affected the incidence of heart disease.

A

Advantages of cohort studies include:

They provide the only way to directly determine incidence (because they follow a cohort over time to assess disease development).

They let researchers assess the relationship of a given exposure to many diseases. In prospective studies, exposure is elicited without bias from a known outcome.

KEY FACT

Cohort studies are also known as longitudinal or prospective or incidence studies, from which both OR and RR can be calculated.

Disadvantages include the following:

Cohort studies can be time-consuming and expensive. Studies only assess the relationship of the disease to the few exposures identified and

measured as a part of the study.

The requirement for many subjects makes it difficult to study rare diseases.

Cohort studies can be either prospective, in which a cohort is assembled in the present and followed into the future, or retrospective, in which a cohort is identified from past records and is followed to the present.

ascertains who is exposed

 KEY FACT  In cohort studies, the researcher ascertains who is exposed or unexposed and follows them over time for disease development.  CASE-CONTROL STUDY 

In a case-control study, a series of cases are identified and a set of controls is sampled from the underlying population to estimate the frequency of exposure in the population at risk for the outcome (see Fig. 2.4-7). In such a study, a researcher compares the frequency of exposure to a possible risk factor between the case and control groups.

Example: A study examines patients with heart disease (cases) and those without heart

disease (controls) and compares exposures to red meat in both groups. Validity depends on appropriate selection of cases and controls, the way exposure is measured, and the ways in which a researcher deals with confounding variables.
======================================
KEY FACT

Accuracy and validity measure bias. Accuracy requires correct measurements. Precision (and reliability) measures random error. Precision ↑ with ↑ sample size.

External validity (also known as generalizability) is the applicability of the results to a new population.

Cases and controls should be comparable in terms of opportunity for exposure (ie, they should be members of the same base population with an equal opportunity of risk factor exposure).

“Matching” occurs when the researcher chooses controls that match cases on a particular characteristic.

Example: If matching on sex, female cases would be matched to female controls and male cases would be matched to male controls.

The purpose of matching is to ↓ confounding.

KEY FACT

In case-control studies, the researcher controls the number of cases and controls. Only ORs can be calculated from case-control studies.

Advantages of case-control studies are as follows:

They use smaller groups than cohorts, thereby reducing costs. They can be used to study rare diseases and can easily examine multiple risk factors. This is because in case-control studies, the OR is a close approximation of RR, known as “rare disease assumption.”

Disadvantages include the following:

Case-control studies cannot calculate disease prevalence or incidence, and they cannot directly estimate the RR because the investigator—not nature—artificially determines the numbers of subjects with and without a disease. However, an OR determined via a case- control study can be used to estimate a measure of RR if the prevalence is low.

the investigator—not without a disease. However, estimate a measure-of RR because of recall TRIAL

Retrospective data can be inaccurate because of recall or survivorship biases.

RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL

An RCT is an experimental, prospective study in which subjects are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Random assignment helps remove confounding and ensure that the two groups are truly comparable. The control group may be treated with a placebo or with the accepted standard of care.

The study can be masked in one of two ways: 1) single blind, in which patients do not know which treatment group they are in, or 2) double blind, in which neither the patients nor their physicians know who is in which group.
======================================
KEY FACT

Randomization minimizes bias and confounding; double-blind studies prevent observation bias.

Double-blind studies are the gold standard for studying treatment effects. Factorial design involves several rounds of randomization with two or more variables. Example: A trial studies the role of aspirin and statins in preventing myocardial

infarction (MI) by creating four groups: one given aspirin only, one given statin only, one given both aspirin and statin, and one given neither. The rates of MI are then measured.

Advantages of RCTs are as follows (see also Table 2.4-1):

TABLE 2.4-1. Comparison of Study Designs

VARIABLE RCT COHORT CROSS-SECTIONAL CASE CONTROL Tests causality through random assignment of exposure Purpose Follows groups of patients over a specified period to capture the associa- tion of risk factors to the development of disease Determines prevalence in a snapshot of time Tests association (usually retrospectively, but outcome first, then looks for risk factors) Measures Varied, including response to RR, OR, incidence, Prevalence (not OR treatment, adverse effects, sur- prevalence incidence) vival during follow-up Design Subjects are randomly assigned Subjects are not assigned Determines disease Identifies cases (disease) to be in treatment or placebo to groups prevalence at one and controls (no arms Determines if subjects are point in time; cannot disease) groups first and in exposed or unexposed determine the direc- then goes backward to groups and follows them tionality of association determine if they are until they develop the between exposure exposed or not (the disease (or do not) and outcome opposite of RCT and cohort studies) Advantages Can determine causality; mini- Temporality can be deter- Less time-consuming Predetermined number mizes bias and confounding mined; incidence can be determined and costly of cases; less time- consuming and costly Disadvantages RCT is not possible when: = Treatment has a known adverse outcome = Disease is very rare © Treatment is in widespread use or represents the best option (because it is unethical to withhold treatment) Follows large groups over long periods Selection bias in retrospec- tive cohort studies Directionality of asso- ciation cannot be determined Incidence cannot be determined Recall bias, selection bias

determined Follows large groups over long periods Selection bias in retrospec- tive cohort studies

They minimize bias. They have the potential to demonstrate causal relationships because exposure is assigned

randomly, which minimizes confounding.

Exposure to the treatment is assigned randomly while other characteristics in the groups are all similar.

Disadvantages include the following:

RCTs are costly and time intensive. Some interventions (eg, surgery) are not amenable to blinding.
======================================
KEY FACT

A drug is available in the market once it passes Phase 3.

PHASES OF CLINICAL TRIALS

A new drug must undergo several phases of testing before being placed on the market for

public use. The phases include testing in animals, healthy volunteers, and small and large groups of patients with disease. Once the drug is on the market, mandatory reporting of adverse events is required during postmarketing surveillance. Table 2.4-2 lists details of these phases.

EVALUATING CLINICAL STUDIES
======================================
BIAS

A bias in research is any process that causes results to systematically differ from the truth. Research can be biased before conduction, during conduction, and after completion (during analysis) (Fig. 2.4-8.)

TRIAL PROGRESSION Trial planning Trial implementation Pre-trial bias Bias during trial Flawed study design Measurement bias Bias after trial Selection bias Recall bias Effect modification Observer bias Confounding bias Hawthorne effect Lead-time bias Length-time bias

FIGURE 2.4-8. Major sources of bias in clinical trials. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

Selection bias: Occurs when samples or participants are selected that differ from the study population in a meaningful way. Example: Individuals concerned about a family history of breast cancer may be more likely to self-select in entering a mammography program, giving the impression of a prevalence that is higher than it is in reality.

Example: If a substantial portion of subjects in one group are lost to follow-up (attrition bias), the study may overestimate the association. This is a special type of selection bias.

Measurement bias: Occurs when measurement or data-gathering methods differ between groups.

Example: One group is assessed by CT, while another group is assessed by MRI.

KEY FACT

Studies that are masked and randomized are better protected from the effects of bias, whereas observational studies are particularly susceptiwble to bias.

Confounding bias: Occurs when a third variable is either positively or negatively associated with both the exposure and outcome variables, inducing an incorrect association.

may experience a population. If people who likely to develop lung fishermen).»So, in testing for would’be a confounding when.a third variable

Example: Fishermen in an area may experience a higher incidence of lung cancer than that found in the general population. If people who smoke become fishermen, then by this logic they are also more likely to develop lung cancer than those who do not smoke (and yet become fishermen). So, in testing for an association between lung cancer and fishing, smoking would be a confounding variable.

Effect modification: Occurs when a third variable disproportionately affects two groups. Effect modification shows a meaningful difference, whereas confounding does not. This can be identified by use of stratified analysis (ie, a subgroup analysis of the cohort).

Example: A study shows that a new chemotherapeutic agent only modestly improves survival rates in some patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, investigators noted that those patients >65 years of age had significant survival benefits, whereas those below the age of 65 years did not. In this case age is an effect modifier.
======================================
KEY FACT

Confounding variables reduce the internal validity of a study.

Recall bias: Results from a difference in the retrospective recall of past factors or outcomes.

Example: A patient with cancer may be more motivated to recall past episodes of chemical exposure than would a healthy individual.

Example: A mother whose child has neural tube defects may likely recall more about lack of folate supplementation during early pregnancy than a mother with a healthy child.

Observer bias: Results from investigator’s awareness of the population being studied and its exposure status.

Example: A trial for new blood pressure management in the intensive care unit (ICU) is biased when the attending physician knows which patients are enrolled in the treatment arm.

Hawthorne effect: Results from study subjects’ awareness that they are being studied, causing them to change aspects of their behavior.

Example: Employees at an automotive factory may work more productively when they realize that their superiors are conducting random audits.

Lead-time bias: Results from earlier detection of disease, giving an appearance of prolonged survival when in fact the natural course is not altered.

Example: A new and widely used screening test that detects cancer 5 years earlier may yield the impression that patients are living longer with the disease.

Length bias: Occurs when screening tests detect a disproportionate number of slowly progressive diseases but miss rapidly progressive ones, leading to overestimation of the benefit of the screen.

Example: A better prognosis for patients with cancer is celebrated, following the implementation of a new screening program. However, this test disproportionately detects slow-growing tumors, which generally tend to be less aggressive.

Q

A hypothetical study finds a ⊕ association between poor sleep habits and the risk for Parkinson disease. The RR is 10, and the P value is 0.4. How do you interpret these results?

between poor and the P value is 0.4. random error is errors are as follows:
======================================
STATISTICAL TESTING

Even with bias reduction, unsystematic random error is unavoidable because of chance variation in studied data. Types of errors are as follows: Type I (α) error:

A type I/α error is the probability of concluding that there is a difference in treatment effects between groups when in fact there is not (eg, a false ⊕ conclusion)—in other words, rejecting the null hypothesis (of no effect) when it should not be rejected. The P value is an estimate of the probability that differences in treatment effects in a

study could have happened by chance alone if no true association exists. A P value of <0.05 is considered statistically significant in medical literature but may not always imply clinical significance (usually noted with meta-analysis where the sample size is large enough to identify a small but clinically insignificant difference in outcome). A P value alone does not give any information about the direction or size of the effect.

Type II (β) error:

A type II/β error is the probability of concluding that there is no difference in treatment effects when in fact a difference exists (eg, a false ⊖ conclusion)—in other words, not rejecting the null hypothesis (of no effect) when it should be rejected.

Power is the probability that a study will find a statistically significant difference when one is truly there. Increasing the number of subjects in a study increases the power. A lower type II error leads to an increase in the power of the study. Similarly, larger effect size would lead to an increase in power and a decrease in need of a large study sample.

Power = 1 − type II error (β)

The confidence interval (CI) is a way of expressing statistical significance that shows the

size of the effect and the statistical power (the narrower the CI, the greater the statistical power). CIs are interpreted as follows: If one is using a 95% CI, there is a 95% chance that the interval contains the true value. Larger sample sizes produce more power and narrower CIs. If the CI includes the null

value (RR of 1.0 or 0), the results are not statistically significant.

Example: An RCT studying aspirin to prevent MI shows an RR of 0.9 with a 95% CI of 0.85 to 0.95 in a sample of 3000 patients, whereas in a sample of 30 patients the 95% CI is 0.1 to 1.7. The first example shows a significant difference, whereas the second does not.

There is no sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore there is insufficient evidence to support an association between poor sleep habits and the risk for Parkinson disease. Remember that the null hypothesis always assumes that there is no association between the exposure and outcome variables. If the P value is >0.05, then you cannot reject the null hypothesis.
======================================
SCENARIOS

study the effect of drug effective for multiple rejected (there is a rejected and statistical is effective for multiple

In a scenario where we are trying to study the effect of drug X on multiple sclerosis, the null hypothesis states that drug X is not effective for multiple sclerosis. If the statistical testing shows: P >0.05, the null hypothesis is not rejected (there is a risk of type II/β error) ie, drug X is

not effective.

P ≤0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and statistical significance is reached (there is a risk of type I/α error) ie, drug X is effective for multiple sclerosis.

Important limitations of P value:

It does not quantify the strength of benefit derived from or the effect size of an intervention or exposure on individual subjects.

It is usually arbitrarily defined to be significant if it is less than or equal to 0.05. This means that there is still a 5% risk of type I/α error even in a statistically significant result.

It does not tell whether an individual patient will derive the same benefit as the whole group.

COMMONLY USED STATISTICAL TESTS

Tests can be used to evaluate either categorical data or numerical data (see Fig. 2.4-9). These are used to represent data and assess if there is any statistically significant difference between two or more groups that are compared.

Fisher’s exact test: Used to assess differences between two categorical variables when the sample size is small.

Chi-square (χ2) test: Used to assess differences between two or more categorical variables when the sample size is large. This test is only an approximation (vs Fischer’s exact test) in a large population.

Correlation: Used to assess if change in one variable is directly linked to change in another variable. Used mostly for continuous variables.

Logistic regression: Used to describe data and explain the relationship between one dependent categorical (binary) variable and one or more independent variables.

Linear regression: Used to predict the value of one dependent continuous variable based on the value of one or more independent variables.
======================================
PREVENTION

There are three levels of prevention: Primary prevention: Includes preventive measures to ↓ the incidence of disease in

unaffected individuals.

Secondary prevention: Focuses on identifying the disease early, when it is asymptomatic or mild, and implementing measures that can halt or slow disease progression. Includes screening tests that are designed to identify subclinical disease.

Tertiary prevention: Includes measures that ↓ morbidity or mortality resulting from the presence of disease.

Quaternary prevention: Includes measures to minimize harm from incidents during

treatment. Prevention may be accomplished by a combination of immunization, chemoprevention, behavioral counseling, and screening. A good screening test has the following characteristics: High sensitivity and specificity (usually more important to have high sensitivity to rule out

those who do not have the disease)

High NPV Inexpensive, easy to administer, and safe Treatment after screening is more effective than subsequent treatment without screening

KEY FACT

Examples of levels of prevention: Primary: ↓ dietary fat/alcohol intake to reduce risk for breast cancer. Secondary: Routine mammograms to screen for breast cancer. Tertiary: Adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen for breast cancer. Quaternary: Identification of a potential polypharmacy-induced interaction prior to

dispensing medications.

VACCINATION

Vaccines work by mimicking infections and triggering an immune response in which memory cells are formed to recognize and fight any future infection. They work as a mode of primary prevention. There are several different vaccine formulations, as indicated in Table 2.4-3.

various providers that These services-may ways: receives set amount divided among all providers

Patients may receive insurance from various providers that reimburse the insured patients based on the services they utilize. These services may provide payment to the clinician or organization in one of the following ways:

Bundled payment: Organization receives set amount per service, regardless of ultimate

cost, with the received amount divided among all providers and facilities involved. Capitation: Clinicians receive a set amount per patient per period regardless of the healthcare utilization. This is usually provided by health maintenance organizations.

Fee-for-service insurance: The patient or insurer pays for each individual service. Discounted fee-for-service insurance: The patient or insurer pays for each utilized

service at a discounted rate predetermined by providers and payers. This service is mostly used by preferred provider organizations.

Global payment: The patient or insurer pays for all expenses for a single incident of care, with a single payment once the service is used. For example, payment for elective surgeries may cover the cost of the surgery and the necessary preoperative and postoperative visits.

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

Many patients may have Medicare or Medicaid enrollment, and this may affect the services they choose to utilize (Table 2.5-1).

======================================
PALLIATIVE CARE

This is an approach to improve the quality of life for patients experiencing life-threatening illness and for their families. The goals of palliative care are to minimize suffering and to provide care that is consistent with the patient’s values. This includes addressing symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, or any other physical symptoms; psychological distress; and social issues. A palliative care team also provides support to families during the patient’s illness and their family’s subsequent bereavement. Care is provided via a team approach (eg, clinicians, nurses, social workers) to support patients and their caregivers. The palliative care approach has five stages:

physical symptoms; provides support to Care is provided patients and their caregivers. created;.and medical of life.

1. Stable: A treatment plan is created, and medical interventions are placed to control symptoms and enhance quality of life.

2. Unstable: Existing symptoms worsen, or patients may have unexpected symptoms, and the care of plan is changed. This stage requires provision of mental, emotional, and spiritual support.

3. Deteriorating: Overall health and body functions of the patient gradually decline, leading to mental and physical distress in the patient and for their family. Emotional support is key during this stage.

4. Terminal: The patient may become bedridden, have loss of appetite, have difficulty in swallowing, and may require daily medical interventions. A hospital setting may be needed for further care provision.

5. Bereavement: This is the stage where the patient has died. The care plan focuses on caring for the patient’s loved ones and addressing their emotional needs, including connection with specific support groups; spiritual support, eg, via a pastor, priest, or rabbi; and psychosocial support to tackle grief, loss, and adjustment.

When the prognosis for the patient is less than 6 months, or when life-prolonging treatment is no longer beneficial, the patient may be referred to end-of-life care or hospice care.
======================================
COMMUNICATION

PATIENT-CENTERED, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVIEWING

There are certain key ways to make a patient feel comfortable being interviewed about their medical history. Following these steps can help obtain a reliable history. These steps are outlined here:

Setting the stage: Welcome the patient and use the patient’s preferred name or pronouns to address them directly. Introduce yourself and identify your specific role. Ensure privacy and comfort for the patient. When patients are accompanied by a caregiver, let them introduce themselves and clarify with the patient if they would want their caregiver to be included in the discussion.

Agenda of interview: Indicate the time available and obtain a list of issues the patient wants to discuss. Let the patient understand how the interview will proceed, and summarize the agenda for that interview.

Nonfocused expression/reflection: Always start with open-ended questions or requests and use nonverbal cues (eg, patient gestures) to obtain more information.

Focused expression/validation: Elicit further history with a focus on description of symptoms, with perspective of impact on the patient’s personal, psychosocial, and emotional contexts. Identify the patient’s beliefs and attributions, while addressing feelings and emotions (Naming, Understanding, Respecting, Supporting, Exploring, or the NURSE technique).

providing a brief to speak freely and nonfocusing techniques and prompting like echoing (repeating and

Recapitulate: Check accuracy by providing a brief summary of what has been dealt with and what needs further input.

Facilitation: Encourage the patient to speak freely and ask questions throughout the interview.

Open-ended skills: Can be nonfocusing techniques like silence (to allow patient to speak), nonverbal encouragement, and prompting the patient to continue with their story, or focusing techniques like echoing (repeating what the patient just said and asking if this is correct), requesting, and summarizing.

Emotion-seeking skills: Ask directly how this condition or situation affects the patient’s emotions. Indirect assessment can include impact of condition on life, beliefs the patient has about their problems, and any triggers that relate to the problem.

Empathy: Name, Understand, Respect, Support, Explore.
======================================
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH RAPPORT

Establishing rapport may be the most difficult part of the medical interview, but there are certain steps to follow for this process as well. Establishing rapport can be done by either the PEARLS model (see Table 2.5-2) or the Ask-Tell-Ask model.

TABLE 2.5-2. PEARLS Model of Establishing Rapport

KEY STEP DEFINITION EXAMPLE Partnership Working with the patient to identify primary problems and preferred solutions You may have difficult times ahead, but we will work together to provide you the best possible care consistent with your goals, values, and beliefs.

difficult-to-break news to taking, one should news to the patient.
======================================
CHALLENGING CONVERSATIONS

When delivering challenging or difficult-to-break news to patients, one should think about the following (SPIKES):

Setting: As with effective history taking, one should ensure a private environment free from distractions when presenting news to the patient.

Perception: Before proceeding with delivering the news, always ask first what the patient thinks about their illness and what their understanding of their current state of health is.

Invitation: Ask the patient if they have any queries they would like answered and the amount of information that they would like to obtain from the clinician before delivering the news.

Knowledge: Educate the patient about the news in small pieces, allowing time for them to process. Assess the patient’s understanding of the news step by step.

Emotions: Acknowledge that the patient responds to the news in a certain way and acknowledge their emotions. When dealing with patients’ emotions, always be empathetic to their responses and listen to them without interrupting.

Strategy: Once the patient feels ready to further discuss treatment options or prognosis and goals of care, offer them an agenda about how to proceed, and schedule their appointments around these agendas.

GENDER- AND SEXUALITY-INCLUSIVE HISTORY TAKING

When interviewing the patient, always take into consideration the following points:

Avoid making assumptions about a patient’s sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual behavior without first asking the patient about these. If gender or sexuality is not relevant for the presenting illness, do not bring it up.

Note that the patient may identify as a different gender than the sex assigned to them at birth.

Try to use gender-neutral terms (eg, partner or spouse) rather than assuming their gender. Always reassure the patient that whatever they share is confidential and even if they are not open about their sexual orientation or gender identity, this information will not be revealed to anyone else without the patient’s prior permission or request.
======================================
CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE HISTORY TAKING

As stressed earlier, patients have their own cultures and specific goals, values, or beliefs and may not accept the treatment plan proposed for them. Always note the following points when interviewing patients:

Try to think about the illness from the patient’s perspective. Try to understand what factors in the patient’s cultures or background (or even some past

experiences) influences certain decisions they make.

Also note how their culture would affect future decisions for treatment.

For example, note that patients who belong to the Jehovah’s Witnesses may refuse lifesaving blood transfusion for themselves (if adult and competent), but they cannot do the same if their child (who is below the legal age and not an emancipated minor) because this amounts to child abuse.

life, or ifthe outcome if the medical community refusing to grant consent over by the State.

KEY FACT

When treatment can save a child’s life, or if the outcome of treatment is a normal life with a reasonably good quality of life, or if the medical community is in agreement about the course of action and if the parent is refusing to grant consent to proceed, the healthcare decisions for that child can be taken over by the State.

MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING

Make sure to counsel the patient on every visit about improving their behavior to help treat their illness if these behaviors affect them directly or indirectly. For example, if a patient smokes, mention smoking cessation at every visit. When the patient notes a desire to change their behavior, document this step and encourage them. If the patient is not expressing such a desire, assess any barriers that may lead to difficulty in changing these behaviors. Expressing a desire to change their behavior is the first step to changing the behavior itself. Once a patient has expressed a desire to change, set goals for the patients to meet. These goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time bound (SMART).
======================================
COMMUNICATING WITH PATIENTS WITH DISABILITIES

When interviewing a patient who has a disability or disabilities, speak directly to the patient and ask them how they identify themselves: person first (ie, a person with a disability) or identity first (ie, a disabled person). Obtain additional information from caregivers when appropriate. Do not assume that these patients cannot complete a certain task; rather, ask them if they require assistance.

For patients with speech difficulties, provide extra time for an interview. For patients with cognitive impairment, use specific language and ask simple, direct

questions.

For patients who are hard of hearing ask them about their preferred mode of communication. Consider using an interpreter when necessary.

Also, do not bring up a disability if it is not relevant to the presenting illness. Do not skip portions of the physical examination even if the disability makes the exam challenging.

INTERPRETERS

When patients who do not speak English or have difficulty in conversing in the language, always use a professionally trained medical interpreter for communication unless the clinician is conversationally fluent in the patient’s preferred language. If professional interpreters are unavailable or if you are working with the patient outside service hours, a telephone or video call may provide the same service. If the patient prefers to use a family member for interpretation, this should be recorded in the chart. In emergencies, facilitate communication using any tools available (eg, friends, family, interpreter apps) even though this may not be standard procedure otherwise.

BEHAVIORAL COUNSELING

When offering counsel, clinicians should tailor their education and suggestions to the individual patient, as well as to their stage of change (see Table 2.5-3 and Fig. 2.5-1).

PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY

SAFETY CULTURE

culture, which is a°collection in relation to risks the “focus-must shift errors by designing amelioration, avoidance, and healthcare process.

This is a part of an organization’s culture, which is a collection of the beliefs, perceptions, and values that the employees share in relation to risks within the healthcare sector. To note, the Institute of Medicine noted that the “focus must shift from blaming individuals for past errors to a focus on preventing future errors by designing safety into the system.” So, patient safety includes the process of amelioration, avoidance, and prevention of adverse injuries or outcomes that arise because of the healthcare process.

PDSA CYCLE

The PDSA cycle involves four key processes (Plan, Do, Study, Act) that help identify possible deficiencies in provisions of care, which when changed, can affect healthcare delivery and improve patient safety. This is a continuous cycle, and it requires reassessment of strategies after implementation of a plan for a set time period (see Fig. 2.5-2).

SWISS CHEESE MODEL

This is a model of risk assessment that focuses on systems and conditions that may align to lead to an adverse event. The Swiss cheese model tries to mitigate such threats at various levels. However, despite provisions of multiple safeguards, an error may occur and lead to harm to the patient when the “holes in the cheese line up” (see Fig. 2.5-3). During a root cause analysis, the goal is to understand how the adverse event occurred, including by understanding how each of these safeguards may have failed. In doing so, efforts to add additional safeguards or revise prior safeguards can help minimize future adverse events.

MEASURING QUALITY OUTCOMES

Delivery of quality healthcare can be assessed by various processes that may evaluate the structure, process, outcome, and balance of any healthcare system:

Structural: Assessment of physical equipment, resources, and facilities. Example: Machine used to evaluate the potassium levels of patients.

Process: Assessment of function of the healthcare system as planned. Example: Number of patients undergoing dialysis utilizing the said function.

Outcome: Measurement of the impact of the healthcare measure on patients. Example: Average levels of potassium of patients undergoing dialysis.

Balancing: Assessment of impact on other systems or outcomes. Example: Average drop in levels of potassium of patients who underwent dialysis compared with the initial levels.

ERRORS IN HEALTHCARE

Although a clinician may have no intention to bring about harm to the patient, certain processes may align to bring about errors in healthcare delivery (see Table 2.5-4). These are called adverse events (errors in medical or surgical treatment that can potentially lead to patient harm, rather than as an impact of the patient’s previous underlying medical condition). The outcome of such events may be unintended injury to the patient, prolonged hospitalization, or even disability.

TABLE 2.5-4. Errors in Healthcare Delivery

TYPE OF ERROR DESCRIPTION IMPACT Active error At the level of the front-line operator Immediate impact (eg, wrong intravenous [IV] dose or illegible hand- writing on orders). Latent error Indirect processes that affect patient care Accident waiting to happen (eg, different types of IV pumps used within the same hospital). Never event Errors that should never happen Major error that should never occur (eg, wrong foot amputated). Near miss Event that could have led to harm but did not Intervention by someone or something that led to prevention but should have not happened (eg, medication interactions that may be recognized by the pharmacist and corrected or cancelled).

Sentinel event Any unexpected occurrence involving death or When repeated, there is a significant chance for a serious adverse serious harm to the patient or the risk thereof outcome (eg, using the same bronchoscope for several patients and not cleaning between the procedures due to miscommunication between staff).

======================================
HEALTHCARE WORKER BURNOUT AND FATIGUE

The leading causes of errors in provision of care include healthcare worker burnout and fatigue. Burnout may occur with prolonged, excessive stress and lead to reduced professional efficacy. Burnout can be due to intrinsic demands of the job, individual susceptibility, and poor work organization. Deprivation of sleep or rest can lead to cognitive impairment and lead to medical errors. This can be minimized by:

Setting clear and consistent goals for the staff Providing training to increase coping strategies, increase role effectiveness, and nurture

better conflict resolution strategies

Encouraging support groups and resource exchange networks Organizing workload and working time, with regular breaks and flexible schedules Providing accommodation for health workers during emergency operations with access to

food services, sanitary facilities, and adequate recreational opportunities

ANALYZING MEDICAL ERRORS

When analyzing medical errors, two different models may be commonly used: (1) root cause analysis and (2) failure mode and effects analysis. The root cause approach is applied after a system failure to find out what went wrong, whereas the failure mode and effects analysis is applied before an error occurs to prevent failure.

Root cause analysis: Typically evaluates sentinel events to decrease the odds of repeating the same event. This process uses records and participant interviews (eg, five whys approach, fishbone diagrams, cause-effect diagrams, process maps) to identify the underlying cause of error.

Failure mode and effects analysis: Concludes that errors will occur even if healthcare professionals are careful. This process helps build redundancies that act as safety nets to trap errors. The process uses inductive reasoning to identify all the ways a system might fail and prioritizes them by their probability of occurrence and impact on patients.

ETHICS AND LEGAL ISSUES

GENERAL/CORE PRINCIPLES

absolute. Clinicians-are preferences. has the right to-refuse the principle of maternal ultimate rights over her a’part of the mother.

Respect for autonomy: This is absolute. Clinicians are obligated to respect patients as individuals and to honor their preferences.

Example: A pregnant patient has the right to refuse a cesarean section despite potential risk to the fetus. This is called the principle of maternal autonomy—as long as the mother has capacity, she has ultimate rights over her unborn child (in the United States), as the fetus is considered a part of the mother.
======================================
KEY FACT

In some cases (eg, psychiatric illness, grave disability), the Baker Act allows for the involuntary hospitalization of patients against their will if they are deemed a threat to themselves or others and are neglectful.

Beneficence: Clinicians have a responsibility to act in the patient’s best interest. Respect for patient autonomy may conflict with beneficence. In general, if a patient is mentally competent, respect for patient autonomy supersedes beneficence even if the clinician believes the patient is not acting in their best interest.

Example: The clinician has a responsibility to recommend a lifesaving transfusion to a Jehovah’s Witness (beneficence) and respect the patient’s autonomy if they should refuse. However, when a parent who is a Jehovah’s Witness refuses emergency medical treatment for their child (claiming the same status for the child), the clinician is not obliged to agree with the parent, but must instead provide the necessary treatment to save the life of the child (beneficence outweighs autonomy).

Nonmaleficence: “Do no harm.” All medical interventions involve benefits and risks, and clinicians should generally only recommend treatments for which the likely benefits outweigh the known risks. Also, it should be made clear to the patient the consequences of refusing treatment if they were to choose so. This category includes most medical and

surgical interventions.

Example: A surgeon declines to perform a procedure because they think the patient will die intraoperatively.

Justice: Healthcare is a scarce resource. Fairness and equality in distribution and delivery of healthcare are ongoing challenges for health policy and in the clinical arena.

Example: A state designs a program for homeless people.

DOCTOR-PATIENT PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP

The doctor-patient relationship is a voluntary relationship. It occurs when the patient agrees to seek medical attention with a specific doctor and when the doctor agrees to care for the patient.

In a hospital setting, emergency management should be provided to all patients.

In the absence of an emergent condition, the clinician is under no legal obligation to accept caring for patients.

Example: If a pregnant patient is seeking to get an abortion, the clinician is under no legal obligation to perform the procedure if that goes against their moral standards. To end a doctor-patient relationship, the doctor should allow patients to have adequate

time to find an alternative clinician.
======================================
KEY FACT

every person coming right to end a.doctor-patient another clinician. RELATIONSHIP

Clinicians are not obligated to accept every person coming to them as a patient. Furthermore, clinicians have the right to end a doctor-patient relationship but must give the patient the resources and time to find another clinician.

DOCTOR-PATIENT SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP

Sexual contact between clinicians and their patients is always inappropriate, independent of who initiates contact.

A patient and clinician should terminate their professional relationship before engaging in a sexual relationship.

No clear recommendation exists as to when it is appropriate to initiate a sexual relationship after termination of the professional relationship.

COMPETENCE AND DECISION-MAKING CAPACITY

COMPETENCE

A person’s global and legal capacity to make decisions and to be held accountable in a court of law. All individuals are competent unless legally proven otherwise. Competence is assessed by the courts and is distinct from the term decision-making capacity.

Incompetent patients, as assessed by the courts, or temporarily incapacitated patients may still be able to provide assent for treatment or refuse treatment. However, the need to treat supersedes the refusal of an incapacitated patient in emergency situations.

Example: A severely hypoxic patient with altered mental status who is unable to accept treatment may receive respiratory supportive therapy, as this constitutes a medical emergency.

Incompetent patients can nonetheless have adequate decision-making capacity to refuse treatment. In these cases, autonomy supersedes beneficence.

Example: Patients living with a psychiatric illness, autism, or intellectual disabilities may be deemed incompetent in managing their finances, while maintaining adequate capacity to refuse treatment.

DECISION-MAKING CAPACITY

The ability of a patient to understand relevant information, appreciate the severity of the medical situation and its consequences, communicate clear and consistent choices, and deliberate rationally about their values in relation to the decision being made. This can be assessed by any clinician, based on a neurologic examination evaluating memory, comprehension, reasoning, and judgment.

Testing for decision-making capacity does not always require a psychiatric consultation. It can be assessed by any clinician.

Decision-making capacity is best understood as varying with the complexity of the decision involved.

needed for a decision choose between two decision-making capacity cancer with be

Example: The level of capacity needed for a decision about liver transplantation is different from that needed to choose between two types of pain medication for fracture-related pain.

In general, patients who have decision-making capacity have the right to refuse or discontinue treatment.

Example: A patient living with cancer with decision-making capacity can opt out of oncologic treatment.

A patient’s decision to refuse treatment can be overruled if the choice endangers the health and welfare of others.

Example: A patient with active tuberculosis (TB) must undergo antibiotic treatment because not treating the patient would pose a public health threat.

All suicidal patients are considered to lack capacity. Occasionally, psychiatric evaluation can be recommended when decision-making capacity is equivocal. In cases where capacity is clearly impaired or intact, there is no need for psychiatric evaluation.

A 47-year-old man is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. His diagnosis and treatment options are discussed, but the patient does not want any intervention. He states that he would like to go home to his spouse and children to die peacefully. What is the most appropriate next step in management?
======================================
Q 2

A 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was struck by a motor vehicle while crossing the street. He is unresponsive and in need of emergent surgery. His

spouse and children cannot be reached. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment?

INFORMED CONSENT

Willing and voluntary acceptance of a specific medical intervention by a patient after adequate discussion with a clinician about the nature of the intervention along with its indications, risks, benefits, and potential alternatives (including no treatment).

Informed consent should be obtained in the language the patient can clearly communicate and understand. If needed, an official translator should be used.

Informed consent is given for a specific procedure, so that autonomy supersedes beneficence.

When emergency treatment is required. Example: An unconscious patient presents with cerebral edema after a motor vehicle collision, or a patient without previously indicated DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) status undergoes cardiac arrest.

In the case a patient lost consciousness and no family member is around to provide consent for a procedure, a witnessed telephone consent is valid if that is the only way to obtain consent.

When a patient lacks decision-making capacity. In this case, consent is still required but must be obtained from a surrogate decision maker. Example: Minors generally require surrogate decision makers until they demonstrate adequate decision-making capacity or are of legal age.
======================================
KEY FACT

Patients with psychiatric illness can give consent if their decision-making capacity is intact.

Informed Consent for Incapacitated Individuals

MNEMONIC

BRAIN of informed consent— Benefits Risks Alternatives Indications Nature

When individuals lose consciousness, doctors and caregivers should respect the patient’s last known wishes, whether expressed orally or in writing. Oral wishes, however, are more difficult to prove.

Example: If a patient repeatedly did not want a procedure performed, performing the

surgery cannot be performed once the patient loses consciousness.

Informed Consent in Reproductive Health

The mother’s autonomy supersedes the rights of the fetus. Except when acting as a surrogate decision maker for the pregnant patient, the father has

no legal right to provide informed consent on a pregnancy-related procedure.

Adults have access to sterilization. Consent is needed from the patient only and not the partner.

Informed Consent for a Never-Competent Person In the case informed consent should be obtained for a never-competent person but no guardian is present, a court-designated third party should make a decision for the medical intervention based on the best interests of the patient.

Informed Consent for Minors

In general, minors (people <18 years of age) cannot consent for their own medical treatment and require parents or guardians to consent on their behalf (one parent is sufficient as long as that parent has custody), except in the following situations:

Life-threatening emergencies: When parents cannot be contacted, parental consent is implied. A court order is not appropriate, as it delays the urgent intervention.

appropriate, as it delays minors donot laws vary from state to are in the armed are financially independent infections.and substance and for

Legal emancipation: Emancipated minors do not require parental consent for medical care. Although emancipation laws vary from state to state, in general minors are emancipated if they are married, are in the armed services, are the parent of a child that they themselves support, or are financially independent of their parents and have obtained legal emancipation.

Sexually transmitted infections and substance abuse treatment: Rules concerning contraception, pregnancy, HIV, and treatment for drug and alcohol dependency vary across the United States.

In cases discussed earlier, treating the patient without notifying the parents is acceptable. In cases where minors are seeking an abortion, encouraging patients to discuss with and notify parents/guardians is likely the best answer. There is no national standard as to whether clinicians should notify parents themselves.
======================================
1 A

The most appropriate next step in management is to respectfully ask the patient about his reasons for not wanting to pursue treatment. Patients often need clarification and reassurance. If he continues to decline treatment, abide by his decision (respect for autonomy).

2 A

The most appropriate next step is to proceed with the surgery. A clinician may give emergent treatment in the absence of informed consent when immediate intervention is necessary to prevent serious harm or death.

In some states, the clinician is left with the decision of informing parents about adolescent use of confidential services in the interest of best serving the patient; other states limit disclosure.

Refusal of Treatment

A parent has the right to refuse treatment for their child as long as those decisions do not pose a serious threat to the child’s well-being.

In nonemergent situations, the clinician in charge is responsible of engaging with the parents and care partners by providing education and clarification regarding the treatment.

When faced with continued resistance despite discussions with the parents, if the parental decision is not in the best interest of the child, the clinician should seek a court order (eg, refusing immunizations is not considered a serious threat; therefore the parent has the right to refuse).

clinician may provide treatment against parental wishes. As such, if withholding treatment jeopardizes the child’s safety, treatment can be initiated on the basis of legal precedent. In the case a child presents to the hospital with severe intra-abdominal hemorrhage and a blood transfusion appears to be necessary and lifesaving, the clinician can override the request of parents not to transfuse in order to save the life of the patient.

Example involving Jehovah’s Witnesses: A clinician provides a blood transfusion to save the life of a 6-year-old child seriously injured in a motor vehicle collision despite parental requests to withhold such a measure.

======================================
KEY FACT

Brain death is the irreversible loss of all brain activity and is equivalent to cardiopulmonary death. If a patient is brain dead, no consent is needed to stop therapy. Two clinicians are required to perform a brain death examination to legally declare a patient brain dead.

END-OF-LIFE ISSUES

ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

An advance directive is a way for patients to let their doctors know what the patient’s wishes are in case they lose capacity. A formal advance directive, such as a living will or healthcare proxy, will override the wishes of the family. Advance directives are legal documents that should be completed by any competent adult.

patient’s wishes to maintain, withhold, or withdraw life-sustaining treatment in the event of terminal disease or a persistent vegetative state when the patient has lost the capacity to make decisions. A living will can be a detailed document describing what tests and interventions the patient would refuse or consent to. If the living will is not detailed, decision making can be more difficult (eg, a living will stating no extraordinary care). This advance directive does not provide enough clarification and medical guidance for clinicians to follow. The definition of extraordinary care is subjective. It can mean no chemotherapy to some patients, but for others it could mean no invasive blood draws.

Physician orders for life-sustaining treatment: POLST is a clinician’s order that outlines a plan for end-of-life care that reflects both the patient’s preferences concerning care at life’s end and the clinician’s judgment, based on a medical evaluation. The POLST is not a replacement of an advance directive.

Q

A 5-year-old girl with hydrocephalus needs another revision of her ventriculoperitoneal shunt. There are no satisfactory alternatives available to relieve her symptoms. Her father consents, but her mother does not want to proceed with the procedure, explaining that she has been through enough procedures in her young life. What is the most appropriate next step in management?
======================================
SURROGATE DECISION MAKING

When faced with an unconscious patient or a patient who cannot make a decision for themselves, surrogate decision making comes into play. The following scenarios are examples of such:

MNEMONIC

or durable power patient

In the absence of a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare— The spouse CHIPS in For the patient Adult CHIldren Parent Sibling Friend (in this order) 

Durable power of attorney for healthcare or “healthcare proxy”: Legally designates a surrogate healthcare decision maker if a patient lacks decision-making capacity. More flexible than a living will. Surrogates should make decisions consistent with the person’s stated wishes regarding medical care only. The healthcare proxy makes decisions based on the patient’s verbal and written communicated wishes. The proxy’s decision outweighs the family wishes.

No living will: If no living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare exists, decisions should be made by close family members (spouse, adult children, parents, and adult siblings) or friends, in that order.

When all are in agreement, decision making on an intervention is straightforward. When family members disagree, the clinician should first encourage discussion. If no consensus is agreed upon, refer the case to the hospital’s ethics committee. Seek a court referral as a last resort.

Ethics committees or court orders can be helpful when the patient lacks capacity, when the patient has no proxy or advance directive and there is disagreement among family members, or when there is disagreement between the family and healthcare team (eg, in cases of medical futility or parental refusal of necessary treatment for minors).

Do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI) orders:

KEY FACT

Do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI) orders do not mean “do not treat.”

DNR and DNI orders are based on patient preferences regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and intubation only. Patients can refuse all nonpalliative treatments or specific therapies (eg, CPR, intubation, antibiotics, feeding tubes).

A DNR/DNI order does not prevent people from getting other interventions (eg, dialysis, chemotherapy, blood transfusions).
======================================
WITHDRAWAL OF LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT

Patients and their decision makers have the right to forego or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Also, the clinician should never use the term withdrawal of care because healthcare staff do not stop caring for a patient. Clinicians should seek to understand patients and their reasons for refusing beneficial treatments.

When a patient has full capacity and decides to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, there is no need for a psychiatric evaluation. Psychiatric evaluations are only needed if the patient’s capacity to understand is uncertain.

No ethical distinction is made between withholding a treatment and withdrawing a treatment, because a patient may choose to refuse an intervention either before or after it is initiated. This can include ventilation, fluids, nutrition, and medications such as antibiotics.

choose to refuse an fluids, nutrition, management is to proceed to proceed with the

The most appropriate next step in management is to proceed with the shunt revision. The consent of one parent is sufficient to proceed with the treatment of a minor, particularly when it is unequivocally clear that the decision is in the child’s best interest.

EUTHANASIA AND CLINICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE

Euthanasia is the administration of a lethal agent by the healthcare provider with the intent to end life.

It is opposed by the American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics and is illegal in all states.

Patients who request euthanasia should be evaluated for inadequate pain control and comorbid depression.

Clinician-assisted suicide consists of prescribing a lethal agent to a patient who will self- administer it to end his or her own life. This is currently illegal except in the states of Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Colorado, and California. This is also legal via court order in Montana.

HOSPICE CARE

Hospice care is a subtype of palliative care focused on palliation of symptoms for patients with a poor prognosis. The focus is on pain management, quality of life, and bereavement.
======================================
A

If the intent is to relieve suffering and if the medications administered are titrated for that purpose, it is considered ethical to provide palliative treatment to relieve pain and suffering even if it may hasten a patient’s death (principle of double effect).

FUTILE TREATMENT

Clinicians are not ethically obligated to provide treatment and may refuse a patient’s or family member’s request for further intervention on the grounds of futility under any of the following circumstances:

There is no evidence or pathophysiologic rationale for the treatment. The intervention has already failed. Maximal intervention is currently failing. Treatment will not achieve the goals of care.

COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPY

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) represents medical services and practices that are not part of standard medical care. As the name indicates, this can include special diets, vitamins, dietary/herbal supplements, meditation, yoga, and hypnosis, among others. These alternative treatments help patients cope with their disease and side effects of their disease such as nausea, fatigue, pain, and loss of appetite. If a patient is interested in alternative/nontraditional treatment, the clinician should obtain more information as to why the patient is interested. The clinician should provide as much information as possible, and they should not dismiss the patient.

DISCLOSURE

FULL DISCLOSURE

Disclosure is the act of making something known in its entirety. Medically, patients have a right to know about their medical status, prognosis, and treatment options (full disclosure). They have the legal right to obtain copies of their medical records within a specified timeframe.

Per the right to autonomy, a patient’s family cannot require that a clinician withhold information from the patient without the knowledge and consent of the patient. When such a case arises, the clinician should explore why the family member does not want the diagnosis revealed. Ultimately, however, the patient should be told.

A clinician may withhold information only if the patient requests not to be told or in the rare and controversial case in which a clinician determines that disclosure would cause severe and immediate harm to the patient (therapeutic privilege). This may include any information that may lead to depression, anxiety, or even resignation from a current job.

Therapeutic privilege does not involve withholding medical information in emergency situations or reporting errors in patient care.

Disclosure is to be done at the earliest time possible, and it is withheld only if there are contraindications to communicating this information to the patient (ie, if it might do more

harm to the patient than good).

If issues arise when information is being disclosed, this is handled by discussing with the patient’s family as to why they don’t want disclosure without actually letting them know the details of the information being disclosed. Alternatively, this can be discussed with the ethics committee if there appears to be a conflict of interest (eg, debate between two siblings over what their parent would have wanted).
======================================
SETTING FOR DELIVERING NEWS

News, good or bad, needs to be disclosed to the patient in a way that it is fully understood, without breach of privacy, and with empathy. A setup needs to be created whenever delivering news so that all these concerns, and more, can be addressed directly.

The most commonly followed model is the SPIKES model. This includes the following:

Setup: This requires the area of news delivery to be in a private area, ideally with everyone sitting down for the discussion. It is also important to include people who the patient thinks should hear the news (with consent by the patient first).

Perception of the patient: The next step entails asking the patient what they know so far about their illness. It is important to know what they think that the news might be: good or bad?

Invitation from the patient: Also, it is important to ask them what information they would like to hear and what they feel like they want to exclude. If the patient thinks they do not want to include certain pieces of information in the discussion, they should be asked why. However, it is important to remember that as much as the patient has the right to know, the patient also has the right not to know.

like they want to exclude. information in remember that as much as know. discussion of the all the information about the intellectual level

After this, the clinician should initiate discussion of the news in stages.

Knowledge: This stage is when all the information about the patient’s current condition is delivered. It is important to know the intellectual level of the patient to make sure that the patient understands what information is being communicated to them. Special circumstances may require detailed diagrams that are simplified for the patient.

Always give information bit by bit, and make sure that you consider the patient’s current emotional state prior to giving information.

Always be gentle and caring. Examples include statements like: “I am sorry to let you know...”, or “I think this piece of information may be particularly disturbing for you...”

Emotions: Prepare to identify any emotion that the patient shows, acknowledge it, and respond in an empathetic manner. Examples include statements such as “I know this might be difficult to hear...” or “I know this might not be what you had anticipated...”

Strategy and summary: Let the patient know that the information you needed to deliver, and that the patient wanted to hear, has now been communicated. Ask the patient if they have any queries or if they have anything else that they might want to hear. If not, ask them about when they may be ready for the next meeting and briefly outline what will be discussed next. Examples include statements like: “Although this news might have come unexpectedly for you, we still need to discuss your care plan. While you process this information, we also need to discuss how to proceed further with your care. If you want to discuss this further, then we can continue. Otherwise, please let me know when you would like to discuss this next.”
======================================
CONFIDENTIALITY

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This law addresses three main issues: privacy (for use and disclosure of individuals’ health information), security (to set national standards for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically protected healthcare-related information), and breach rules (to notify affected individuals, federal government, and media about unsecured protected health information).

Protected health information is any information that is transmitted or maintained in electronic media directly related to an individual’s healthcare. This may also involve any verbal communications (eg, talk over coffee or lunch) that discloses patients’ identifiable health information (eg, name, patient number). This can also include bills, admission profile, prescription records, referral, discharge, and follow-up appointments.

Information disclosed by a patient to their clinician and information about a patient’s medical condition are strictly confidential and should be discussed and accessed only by those directly involved in the patient’s care, with few exceptions (described later). This may require disclosure to a healthcare monitoring body like the Centers for Disease Control or Prevention (CDC), or even to the police.

Who has access to medical records? This is typically reserved only for the patient or their authorized representatives. A patient may waive the obligation of the clinician to protect confidentiality (eg, with insurance companies, authorized family members), preferably by way of written or verbal consent. The clinician should disclose only the minimally necessary information to these personnel.

It is ethically and legally necessary to override confidentiality in the following situations:

Patient intent to commit a crime against an identifiable victim (Tarasoff decision): Clinicians have a duty to protect the intended victim through reasonable means (eg, warn the victim, notify police).
======================================
KEY FACT

Signs of suspected child abuse:

Suicidal patients. Child abuse/neglect and elder abuse/neglect. Reportable infectious diseases (eg, HIV, sexually transmitted infections, TB, polio, diphtheria, rabies, enteric fever, tetanus, COVID-19): There is a duty to warn public officials and identifiable people at risk. It is normally best to encourage patients themselves to inform sexual contacts who are at risk for contracting the illness.

Reportable noninfectious diseases: These include cancer, carbon monoxide poisoning, silicosis, and lead poisoning.

KEY FACT

Potential signs of elder abuse and neglect: Cuts, bruises, pressure ulcers, burns Uncommon fractures Malnutrition or dehydration Anogenital injury or infection Evidence of poor caretaking or financial exploitation

financial exploitation include food- and water-borne

Notifiable outbreaks: These include food- and water-borne disease outbreaks. Currently patients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are also reportable.

Gunshot and knife wound (a duty to notify the police): Such instances also include emergency scenarios when the treating clinician is trying to obtain consent over the phone because the patient cannot provide one.

The patient is a danger to others (eg, impaired automobile drivers): Currently, only six states have mandatory clinician reporting laws.

Example: A patient begins to drive 1 week after hospitalization for seizures, although the department of motor vehicles in his state requires that licensed drivers be without seizures for at least 3 months.

KEY FACT

Guiding principles for overriding confidentiality: There is an identifiable third party at risk for harm. The harm is significant and probable. Disclosure will help prevent or mitigate the harm. Other measures, such as convincing the patient to self-disclose, have failed.
======================================
CLINICAL RESEARCH

The formal definition of clinical research is any medical research that tests new investigations, treatments, and therapies on people or against a standard of care.

The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association (WMA) binds the clinician with the statement: “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” which implies that the patient should be protected from harmful treatment at all times. As such, patients may choose voluntarily to be research subjects, or they may be enrolled in a therapeutic trial for a disease without any known cure to see if they may benefit from the treatment.

mentions that clinicians are obligated to inform patients considering involvement in a clinical research protocol about the purpose of the research study and the entire study design as it will affect the patient’s treatment. This includes the possible risks, benefits, and alternatives to the research protocol. Clinicians are also obligated to inform the participants that no patient identification label (eg, name, patient number) will be used in the research.

CORE PRINCIPLES OF CLINICAL RESEARCH

following: protocols, with repeated of results treatment options,

The principles followed include the following:

Ensuring compliance with clinical protocols, with repeated reviews confirming the same during the time of research

Verification of scientific validity of results Ensuring a fair system of selecting treatment options, with removal of bias where possible Obtaining informed consent discussing benefit and harm prior to participation in research

KEY FACT

Mandatory reporting of intimate partner violence is controversial and varies by state. Nonetheless, clinicians should document the encounter, offer support, and have resources available for assistance.

ETHICAL CONCERNS

Pregnant patients: Ensure no harm comes to both mother and child during research. Children: It is important to obtain assent of the child, even though the consent from the

guardians is mandatory.

Incurable illness: The clinician should make sure the patient does not enroll only for anticipated personal benefit.

Monetary compensation: Such compensation may provide undue influence for accepting the risk for contracting a disease or being harmed in the process. Most trials provide only out-of-pocket expenses as compensation.

Recruitment: The patient may be enrolled in multiple trials due to lack of volunteers or due to rarity of disease. This may lead to bias in the results and to patient harm.

Stem cell research: Such research has an intrinsic difficulty with maintaining anonymity of human tissue donors, ownership of tissue, long-term storage of samples, and manipulation of genetic material to create new organisms.

Inability for patient to consent: In this case, the clinician should obtain consent from the legally authorized representative.

Incarcerated patients: Incarceration does not change the process of consent or healthcare rights.
======================================
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Occurs when clinicians find themselves having a personal interest in a given situation, which influences their professional obligations.

Example: A clinician may own stock in a pharmaceutical company (financial interest) that produces a drug he is prescribing to his patient (patient care interest).

Clinicians should disclose existing conflicts of interest to affected parties (eg, patients, institutions, audiences of journal articles or scientific meetings).

Accepting gifts from pharmaceutical companies can influence a clinician’s practice and should generally be avoided. Nonmonetary gifts should be accepted only if they will directly benefit patient care and are of small monetary value. A clinician should never accept cash.

offer to provide:the treating as an expression of care or preferential relationship.

GIFTS FROM PATIENTS

A patient or patient party may offer to provide the treating healthcare team or a particular member in the team with a gift as an expression of gratitude or as a reflection of the patient’s culture.

Accepting gifts or cash to influence care or preferential treatment is unacceptable. This can further harm the patient-doctor relationship.

When accepting a gift, keep the following in mind: Do not allow the gift or offer to influence care. Decline gifts if acceptance may present financial or emotional hardship to the gifting

family.

Be sensitive about the patient’s emotions and be fair (accepting a gift may lead to impaired relationship among team members if the gift is provided disproportionately).

Q

A 35-year-old woman visits a primary care clinician after hurting her wrist. Physical exam reveals circumferential bruises of her wrist, neck, and arms. The patient admits that the injuries were inflicted by her partner. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

GIFTS FROM DRUG COMPANIES

Governed by the Sunshine Act, which requires clinicians to disclose any financial information or conflict of interest required by employers, advisory board, and institutions that provide research funding.

Includes gifts that cost more than $10 or any small gifts that are worth cumulatively a sum of more than $100.

Exemptions include certified and accredited continuing medical education, buffet lunch

and snacks at large-scale events, product samples not intended for sale, education material for patients, charitable items, or loaned devices for a trial period of less than 90 days. However, such gifts, or any advertisements, if received, should not alter the appropriate

evidence-based practice of medicine on the clinician’s part.
======================================
MALPRACTICE

DEFINING MALPRACTICE

Medical malpractice occurs when a hospital, doctor, or other healthcare professional causes injury or permanent harm to a patient as a result of a negligent act of carelessness. This may occur in two different ways: acts of omission (breach of duty to provide appropriate care to patients when capacity to consent was not determined) or acts of commission (doing something purposefully that leads to harm, despite being aware of possible outcomes without notifying the patient of such outcomes).

The essential elements of a civil suit under negligence include:

patient. damage. Samaritan” laws, which are certified by a respond to victims

The clinician has a Duty to the patient. Dereliction of duty occurs. There is Damage to the patient. Dereliction is the Direct cause of damage.

An exception involves the “Good Samaritan” laws, which protect those who have completed basic first aid training and are certified by a healthcare organization. These laws apply mostly to those people who may respond to victims in good faith and in a rational manner, with the aim of preventing harm.

Unlike a criminal suit, in which the burden of proof is “beyond a reasonable doubt,” the burden of proof in a malpractice suit is “a preponderance of the evidence.”

Clinicians may refuse inappropriate requests, such as demanding to be seen after hours. The clinician should set clear limits and professional boundaries while remaining calm. If the patient has a nonurgent condition, the clinician should not recommend that the patient visit the emergency department.

MNEMONIC

The 4 Ds of malpractice— Duty Dereliction Damage Direct cause

IMPAIRED PRACTICING CLINICIAN

Impairment does not only refer to aging. Per the AMA, an impaired clinician is one whose physical or mental health interferes with their ability to safely engage in professional activities. This can also involve anxiety (a major stress factor that affects job performance and working memory), burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced sense of personal accomplishment), and those clinicians with substance use disorder.

A clinician has an obligation to protect patient interests and ensure appropriate care and assistance to other clinicians/colleagues who may be impaired physically or mentally. They should also report impaired colleagues to the peer review body of the hospital (eg, the program director or medical director) or the local or state medical board when the physician does not have hospital privileges. When compromise of a patient’s health and safety is an immediate threat, report directly to the state licensing board. If the situation does not change despite prior reporting, report to a higher authority.

Example: A clinician notes that his colleague, a surgeon, gets repeatedly drunk at parties throughout the week and comes late to work the next day. A patient has recently filed a malpractice lawsuit, as the patient believes that the doctor operated on him in a drunken state. Your responsibility in this case is to refer the clinician to a clinician health program for further evaluation and possible therapy.

The most appropriate next step would be to offer support and acknowledge the courage it takes to discuss abuse. Assess the safety of the woman and of any children involved, introduce the concept of an emergency plan, and encourage the use of community resources. If the patient consents, report the abuse to relevant authorities.

Oral Leukoplakia

Generally asymptomatic, premalignant lesions that occur in 1.5% to 4.3% of the normal population.

KEY FACT

Oral hairy leukoplakia is a manifestation of EBV seen in immunocompromised patients. It affects the lateral portion of the tongue and presents with painless plaques that have a feathery or hairy appearance and cannot be scraped off. There is no malignancy potential.

History/PE Patients present with white patches in the oral mucosa that cannot be scraped off (Fig. 2.6- 1A). The reported rates of transformation to SCC vary widely, ranging from <1% to 36%.

Risk Factors Tobacco use, alcohol use, and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Risk factors for transformation to SCC: Nonhomogeneous lesions, large lesions (>4 cm diameter), multiple anatomic sites, high-risk location (lateral tongue and floor of the mouth), and dysplasia on histologic examination.

Diagnosis Definitive diagnosis is based on biopsy and histopathology. Histopathology may show hyperkeratosis, atrophy, inflammation, hyperplasia, or dysplasia. Occasionally there may be carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma.

biopsy and hyperkeratosis, atrophy, be carcinoma in situ intraoral infection in the oral mucosa.
======================================
KEY FACT

Oral candidiasis is an opportunistic, intraoral infection that most commonly presents with confluent white patches and plaques in the oral mucosa. They are differentiated from leukoplakia because they can be scraped or wiped off, exposing an erythematous base (see the Candidiasis section in the Dermatology chapter).

Treatment Options include surgical excision of smaller high-risk lesions. For larger lesions, risk factor modification (eg, cessation of smoking and alcohol use) and close clinical and histologic surveillance are indicated.

Other options include destruction (with laser ablation or cryosurgery) and medical treatment (eg, retinoids, vitamin A).

Lifelong follow-up is required due to high recurrence and development of squamous cell carcinoma.

Erythroplakia Red, well-demarcated lesions commonly located on the floor of the mouth, the ventral tongue, or soft palate that cannot be explained by another disease (Fig. 2.6-1B). An estimated 2.7% of cases annually transform to SCC. Hx/PE: Generally asymptomatic in patients Risk factors: Most often found in older adults who use tobacco and consume alcohol Dx: Definitive diagnosis based on biopsy and histopathology, which may show dysplasia,

carcinoma in situ, or even invasive SCC

Tx: Similar to leukoplakia

Oral Submucosal Fibrosis Submucosal fibrosis of the whole oral mucosa (Fig. 2.6-1C). The estimated annual rate of transformation to SCC is 2% to 8%. Hx/PE: Burning, ulceration, and pain of the oral mucosa Risk factors: Chewing araca nuts (including betel quid, paan) Dx: Based on history and biopsy findings Tx: Discontinuing betel products—mainstay of treatment

Oral Lichen Planus Inflammatory lesions of the skin and oral mucosa with a prevalence of 1% to 3% (see the Miscellaneous Skin Disorders section in the Dermatology chapter for more details). Oral lesions appear as reticular white plaques, mucosal erythema, or erosions most commonly affecting the buccal mucosa. The overall transformation rate to SCC is 1% to 2%.

Hx/PE: Reticular white plaques that are rarely symptomatic. Other lesions can present with pain.

Dx: Based on clinical evaluation and biopsy findings Tx: No treatment for asymptomatic disease. Treatment of symptomatic disease is with

topical corticosteroids (first line). If ineffective, topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus can be used. Refractory disease may require oral glucocorticoids or systemic immunomodulators.

======================================
OROPHARYNGEAL CANCERS

Oropharyngeal SCC is the most common oral cancer (up to 90% of all oral neoplasms). It most commonly arises from premalignant lesions such as leukoplakia, erythroplakia, or lichen planus.

History/PE Patients may be initially asymptomatic. Most commonly, oral cancer presents as an ulcerated lesion with a central necrotic area with rolled-up borders. The most common locations are the lateral and ventrolateral parts of the tongue, although other areas may also be affected.

Risk Factors Smoking or use of smokeless tobacco Alcohol consumption Areca (betel) nut ingestion (more prevalent in developing countries) Sometimes associated with HPV-16 and chronic irritants (eg, certain mouthwashes)

Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on biopsy and histopathology. Laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy are required to rule out simultaneous second primary cancers. After diagnosis, head and neck CT and a x-ray of the chest (CXR) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT are done to determine extent of spread and metastasis.

Treatment

Treatment is initially surgical resection. Lymph node dissections are done with significant nodal disease or deep invasion. Surgical reconstruction is important to reduce postsurgical disability. Postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used with high-risk or advanced disease. In many patients for whom surgical resection is challenging or overly morbid (or in certain subtypes [eg, HPV-associated cancers]), chemotherapy and radiation will be used as the definitive treatment with curative intent, with no surgery except in cases of relapse.

SALIVARY GLAND DISEASE

The sublingual, submandibular, and parotid glands are the most prominent salivary glands. Clinically, salivary gland swelling may be approached by identification of chronicity (acute vs chronic) and distribution (unifocal [single gland] vs multifocal [multiple glands]) of swelling. Figure 2.6-2 shows an outline of salivary gland pathologies based on this approach. Tables 2.6-2 and 2.6-3 describe selected non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions in detail.

DYSPHAGIA/ODYNOPHAGIA

Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or pain with swallowing (odynophagia) caused by abnormalities of the oropharynx or esophagus. Figure 2.6-3 illustrates approaches to the diagnosis of esophageal dysphagia.

FIGURE 2.6-3. Approach to differential diagnosis of esophageal dysphagia. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

KEY FACT

In an immunocompromised person with odynophagia, candidiasis should be one of the differential diagnoses.

Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Problem with initiation of swallowing that may lead to aspiration of food into the lungs or regurgitation of food. Etiology: Neurologic or muscular, including stroke, Parkinson disease, myasthenia gravis,

prolonged intubation, and Zenker diverticula.

Usually more of a problem with liquids than with solids.

KEY FACT

Patients who are immunocompromised (eg, HIV) with odynophagia or dysphagia may be empirically treated for candida esophagitis. EGD can be considered if there is no response to diagnose other causes (eg, CMV or HSV esophagitis).

History/PE: Rule out alternative syndromes such as xerostomia, globus, and esophageal dysphagia through history and physical examination.

physical examination. laboratory tests torule imaging if central swallow-(video Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Fig. 2.6-3). swallowing therapy, and

Investigations: Consider specific laboratory tests to rule out myopathies, myasthenia, or other conditions. Consider brain imaging if central nervous system (CNS) tumor, stroke, or head trauma is suspected.

Best initial test: Modified barium swallow (video fluoroscopic swallowing exam) ± esophageal manometry. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may also be appropriate to rule out structural disease (see Fig. 2.6-3).

Treatment: Diet modification, swallowing therapy, and sometimes temporary nonoral feeds. Severe dysphagia may require nonoral feeding (eg, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) or tracheostomy. Structural causes must be treated specifically (eg, cricopharyngectomy and diverticulectomy for Zenker diverticula).

Esophageal Dysphagia Generally, patients complain that food gets “stuck” in the throat; however, there is no issue

initiating swallowing.

Can be caused by an obstruction (eg, strictures, Schatzki rings, webs, carcinoma) or motility disorder (eg, achalasia, scleroderma, esophageal spasm).

Obstructions usually more of a problem with solids than with liquids; motility disorders cause both solid and liquid food dysphagia.

Best initial test: EGD; consider pre-EGD barium swallow (aka esophagram) if history of esophageal radiation, caustic ingestion, esophageal or laryngeal cancer surgery, or strictures, as these patients may be at higher risk for esophageal perforation; this may be followed by manometry in some cases.
======================================
KEY FACT

Esophageal webs are associated with iron-deficiency anemia and glossitis (Plummer-Vinson syndrome).

History Commonly presents with odynophagia and/or dysphagia.

KEY FACT

Candida esophagitis is an AIDS-defining illness, typically when CD4+ cell count <100 cells/ µL.

KEY FACT

High-risk factors for Candida esophagitis include broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), cancer, diabetes, organ transplant, mechanical ventilation, and indwelling catheter.

PILL (MEDICATION-INDUCED) ESOPHAGITIS

Caused by ingestion of medications that have a direct toxic effect on the mucosa of the esophagus through creation of a localized acidotic or alkaline environment by the inciting medication.

Risk Factors Medication known to be associated with pill esophagitis (see related key fact) Taking medications without water or immediately before lying down

Anything that might increase dwell time of medications in the esophagus (eg, geriatric- related low saliva production, altered esophageal anatomy, drinking insufficient water with medication, and motility disorders of the esophagus)

History/PE Dysphagia/odynophagia Retrosternal burning Taking an offending medication

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis for patients with symptoms who took a medication known to cause pill

esophagitis

Upper endoscopic evaluation with biopsy for patients with severe symptoms (hematemesis, abdominal pain, weight loss) or symptoms that don’t resolve after discontinuing the medication for at least 1 week

Endoscopic evaluation usually reveals a localized ulceration of the esophagus with surrounding normal mucosa (see Fig. 2.6-4)

Treatment Discontinuing inciting medication (symptoms usually resolve in 7 to 10 days after

discontinuation)

If medication cannot be discontinued, switching to liquid formulation
======================================
EOSINOPHILIC ESOPHAGITIS

Immune-mediated disorder of the esophagus in which eosinophils are recruited to the esophagus causing dysphagia or food impaction.

History/PE Past medical history of seasonal allergies and asthma Presents with dysphagia, food impaction, centrally located chest pain not relieved by

proton pump prohibitors (PPIs)

Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and evaluation with EGD and esophageal

biopsy

EGD most commonly shows ringlike structures (44%) or thickened linear furrows (48%) (see Fig. 2.6-5)

Biopsy is the most accurate test and will reveal esophageal inflammation with an eosinophilic-predominant infiltrate (≥15 eosinophils per high-powered field on light microscopy)

KEY FACT

Common causes of pill esophagitis include antibiotics (especially tetracyclines), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), bisphosphonates, ascorbic acid, potassium chloride, ferrous sul-fate, acetaminophen, warfarin, and chemotherapy regimens.

Treatment Best initial treatment: PPIs and elimination of possible causes (ie, six-food elimination

diet involving exclusion of wheat, milk, egg, nuts, soy, and fish/shellfish).

If initial treatment fails, swallowed inhalational steroids or swallowed topical steroids are recommended for further management.

Esophageal dilation may be required in refractory disease.

ESOPHAGEAL RINGS

Concentric “ring” of tissue protruding into the esophageal lumen. Most commonly seen in the distal esophagus. Often associated with another condition (eg, eosinophilic esophagitis and hiatal hernia). Schatzki rings are the most common type of esophageal ring. In Figure 2.6-5,

rings are shown on fluoroscopic evaluation (A) and endoscopic evaluation (B).

History/PE Patients with esophageal rings are usually asymptomatic, but they may present with dysphagia to solids. With more chewing, symptoms tend to be less severe. Increased severity of symptoms is associated with internal diameter of esophageal lumen associated with ring.

Diagnosis Barium swallow: Thin, symmetric, circumferential narrowing EGD and biopsy: Thin, smooth, circumferential membrane; biopsy used to evaluate for

esophagitis

Treatment Goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms if present and prevent recurrent symptoms. Initial therapy: Esophageal dilation followed by 6 weeks of PPI therapy Recurrent and refractory symptoms: Repetition of EGD to confirm absence of

eosinophilic esophagitis (can be patchy) and repetition of esophageal dilation + addition of long-term PPI.
======================================
KEY FACT

impaction of the most often involves a causes of dysphagia. SYNDROME

Steakhouse syndrome refers to food impaction of the esophagus after eating a piece of food without sufficient chewing. This most often involves a meat bolus. Steakhouse syndrome must be differentiated from other causes of dysphagia.

PLUMMER-VINSON SYNDROME

History/PE Plummer-Vinson syndrome presents with a classic triad of dysphagia, iron-deficiency anemia (fatigue and weakness), and esophageal webs. Additional findings may include glossitis, angular cheilitis, koilonychia, splenomegaly, and thyromegaly. Figure 2.6-6 shows a radiographic view of an esophageal web.

Annual upper endoscopy + biopsy: Recommended by some to watch for development of SCC, although no change in outcomes has been observed in the literature with this screening

KEY FACT

Esophageal webs are like esophageal rings, but they are noncircumferential and are associated with different conditions (eg, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, which occurs in patients with long-term iron-deficiency anemia). Esophageal webs are often ruptured during EGD and do not cause recurrent or refractory symptoms.

DISTAL ESOPHAGEAL SPASM

Motility disorder in which normal peristalsis is periodically interrupted by high-amplitude, nonperistaltic contractions (see Fig. 2.6-7A).

FIGURE 2.6-7. Esophageal disease on barium esophagram. (A) Esophageal spasm. (B) Achalasia. Note the dilated esophagus tapering to a “bird’s beak” narrowing (arrows) at the LES.

History/PE Presents with heartburn, chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. Often precipitated by ingestion of hot or cold liquids; relieved by nitroglycerin.
======================================
KEY FACT

The musculature of the upper one-third of the esophagus is skeletal, whereas that of the lower two-thirds is smooth muscle.

Diagnosis EGD with biopsy: Best initial test to rule out other esophageal disorders. Barium swallow: Shows a corkscrew-shaped esophagus. Done as initial test prior to EGD

in selected patients at risk of perforation (proximal esophageal lesion [eg, Zenker diverticulum, radiation therapy], known complex strictures [due to radiation exposure or caustic injury]).

Most accurate test: Esophageal manometry, which allows for definitive diagnosis. High- amplitude, simultaneous contractions shown in greater than 20% of swallows.

Treatment Symptomatic relief: Calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), or

nitrates

Severe, incapacitating symptoms: Growing evidence supporting peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)

ACHALASIA

Motility disorder of the esophagus characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and loss of peristalsis in the distal two-thirds of the esophagus.

Etiology Degeneration of the inhibitory neurons in the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus.

History/PE Progressive dysphagia (solids and liquids), chest pain, regurgitation of undigested food, weight loss, and nocturnal cough.

Diagnosis Best initial test: EGD to rule out structural disorders, including mechanical obstruction,

pseudoachalasia, cancer.

Most accurate test: High-resolution manometry, which shows increase in resting LES pressure, incomplete LES relaxation upon swallowing, and decrease in peristalsis in the body of the esophagus (see Fig. 2.6-8).

FIGURE 2.6-8. Achalasia. Manometry with incomplete LES relaxation. (Reproduced with permission from Farrokhi F, Vaezi MF. Idiopathic (primary) achalasia. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2007;2:38.)

Barium swallow is useful when manometric findings are equivocal. Will show esophageal dilation with “bird’s beak” tapering of the distal esophagus (see Fig. 2.6-7B).

Treatment Definitive: First-line treatment options are laparoscopic Heller myotomy, POEM, and less

often, pneumatic dilation.

If first-line options are unsuitable, the physician may administer injection of botulinum toxin.

Calcium channel blockers and phosphodiesterase inhibitors or nitrates may provide short- term relief. They are only used in patients who are not candidates for definitive therapy and have failed botulinum toxin injection.
======================================
ESOPHAGEAL DIVERTICULA

Diverticula can be present in any location in the esophagus or pharynx. Usually due to distal stricture/stenosis leading to increased pressure in the proximal esophagus. Zenker diverticulum is a cervical outpouching through the cricopharyngeus muscle. It is a posterior, false diverticulum (outpouching only through submucosa and mucosa). See Figure 2.6-9.

Hx/PE: Chest pain, dysphagia, halitosis, and regurgitation of undigested food. Dx: Barium swallow to demonstrate outpouchings.

Tx: If symptomatic, surgical excision of the diverticulum. For Zenker diverticulum, myotomy of the cricopharyngeus required to relieve the high-pressure zone.

GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is symptomatic reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, most commonly from transient LES relaxation. Incompetent LES, gastroparesis, or hiatal hernia can all contribute to GERD, but they are not the sole causes. Figure 2.6-10 depicts the general management approach to GERD-like symptoms.

FIGURE 2.6-10. Management of GERD-like symptoms. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

History/PE Heartburn and/or regurgitation that commonly occurs 30 to 90 minutes after a meal;

worsens with reclining; and often improves with antacids, sitting, or standing. Uncommon symptoms: sour taste, a globus sensation, unexplained cough, morning hoarseness, and chest pain mimicking coronary artery disease.

Normal unless a systemic disease (eg, scleroderma) is present.

Diagnosis Primarily a clinical diagnosis, with empirical treatment first in patients without alarm

symptoms (see later for lifestyle modification and medical treatment).

Most accurate test: 24-hour pH monitoring with impedance; indicated if the diagnosis is uncertain.

EGD with biopsy: Performed in patients whose symptoms are the following:

Refractory to initial empiric therapy Long-standing (to rule out Barrett esophagus and adenocarcinoma; see Fig. 2.6-11)

FIGURE 2.6-11. Barrett esophagus on upper endoscopy. Shown is proximal extension of Z- line (squamocolumnar junction between esophagus and stomach) caused by columnar metaplasia.

referral) should be done refractory symptoms-or if Although barium swallow prevalence of physiologic

Other studies: Indicated for refractory symptoms or if concern for other causes. May include esophageal manometry. Although barium swallow may demonstrate reflux, its role is limited due to a high prevalence of physiologic reflux.

KEY FACT

GERD can mimic angina or myocardial infarction.

KEY FACT

GERD is not a result of the presence of Helicobacter pylori. GERD arises from a transient relaxation of the LES.

Treatment Lifestyle modifications: Indicated for all patients, these modifications include weight loss; head-of-bed elevation; small meals; avoidance of nocturnal meals; avoidance of substances like alcohol, chocolate, or coffee that ↓ LES tone.

An initial, empirical trial of pharmacotherapy (eg, 8 weeks of PPI) is indicated in patients with clinical features of GERD in the absence of alarm symptoms.

In the presence of alarm symptoms (weight loss, dysphagia, and gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) and in patients with multiple risk factors for Barrett esophagus, endoscopy should be performed initially (ie, before trial of PPI).

Pharmacologic treatment:

Mild/intermittent: Antacids Chronic/frequent: H2-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, famotidine) or PPIs

(omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole). Fundoplication surgery or other antireflux procedures may benefit carefully selected patients.

Severe/erosive: PPIs first; fundoplication surgery or other antireflux procedures may benefit carefully selected patients.

Complications: Erosive esophagitis, esophageal peptic stricture, aspiration pneumonia, upper GI bleeding, Barrett esophagus, adenocarcinoma.

Management of Barrett esophagus: Optimization of medical therapy (should be on chronic PPI therapy). Based on biopsy findings, management calls for the following steps:

No dysplasia: Repeat endoscopy every 3 to 5 years Indefinite dysplasia: Repeat endoscopy in 2 to 6 months Dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma: Treat with endoscopic eradication Esophageal adenocarcinoma: See Esophageal Cancer section of this chapter for

treatment.
======================================
HIATAL HERNIA

Herniation of stomach upward into the chest through the diaphragm. Common types: Sliding hiatal hernia (95%): Gastroesophageal junction and a portion of the proximal

stomach are displaced above the diaphragm (see Fig. 2.6-12).

A Hemiated gastric cardia Herniated gastric fundus

FIGURE 2.6-12. (A) Sliding hiatal and (B) paraesophageal hiatal hernia. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Paraesophageal hiatal hernia (5%): Gastroesophageal junction remains below the diaphragm while the fundus herniates into the thorax (see Fig. 2.6-12).

Hx/PE: Most are asymptomatic. Patients with sliding hernias may present with GERD; paraesophageal hernias can cause strangulation.

Dx: Incidental finding is apparent on CXR; it is also frequently diagnosed by barium swallow or EGD.

Tx:

Sliding hernias: Medical therapy and lifestyle modifications to ↓ GERD symptoms Paraesophageal hernias: Surgical gastropexy to prevent gastric volvulus in some

cases

ESOPHAGEAL CANCER

SCC is the most common type of esophageal cancer worldwide. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

Risk Factors SCC: Alcohol use, tobacco use, and nitrosamines Adenocarcinoma: Barrett esophagus (intestinal metaplasia of the distal esophagus

secondary to chronic GERD)

KEY FACT

SCC of the esophagus tends to occur in the upper and middle thirds of the esophagus, whereas adenocarcinoma occurs in the lower third.

solids and later to and vomiting are also test: EGD + biopsy; (EUS) for tumor staging

History/PE Progressive dysphagia—initially to solids and later to liquids—is common. Weight loss, odynophagia, GERD, GI bleeding, and vomiting are also seen.

Diagnosis Best initial and most accurate test: EGD + biopsy; required to establish diagnosis CT and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for tumor staging

KEY FACT

No radiologic test can diagnose esophageal cancer. Diagnosis must be made with a tissue biopsy.

KEY FACT

Esophageal cancer metastasizes early, because the esophagus lacks a serosa.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Chemoradiation and surgical resection. If there is metastatic

Best initial treatment: Chemoradiation and surgical resection. If there is metastatic disease that is considered incurable, systemic therapy alone is used.

disease that is considered incurable, systemic therapy alone is used. Resection is also indicated in cases of high-grade Barrett dysplasia Has a poor prognosis
======================================
KEY FACT

Resection is required for esophageal cancer treatment to be curative.

KEY FACT

One unit of packed RBCs should ↑ hemoglobin by 1 g/dL and hematocrit by 3 to 4 units.

GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING

Overt GI bleeding presents as hematemesis, hematochezia, and/or melena. Bleeding may be from the upper GI tract (ie, bleeding from lesions proximal to the ligament of Treitz, the anatomic boundary between the duodenum and jejunum) or from the lower GI tract. Table 2.6-5 presents the features of upper and lower GI bleeding, and this chapter discusses selected conditions.

UPPER GI BLEEDING

Esophageal and Gastric Varices

Etiology Esophageal and gastric varices stem from increases in portal pressure, which result in collateral flow of blood from the portal circulation into the systemic circulation via

portosystemic shunts that increase esophageal venous blood flow. This may result in dilated esophageal veins (ie, esophageal varices) that are prone to bleeding.

The most common reason for increased portal pressure is hepatic cirrhosis (due to alcohol abuse or viral hepatitis). Other causal conditions include right heart failure and hepatic vein obstruction (Budd-Chiari syndrome). See Figure 2.6-13 for endoscopic images of esophageal varices.

FIGURE 2.6-13. Esophageal varices seen on upper endoscopy. (Adapted with permission from Akiyama T, Abe Y, Iida H, et al.

History/PE Painless GI bleeding manifesting as hematemesis or melena (less commonly

hematochezia)

Possible signs and symptoms of cirrhosis such as jaundice, pruritis, hepatic encephalopathy (altered mental status), asterixis, palmar erythema, caput medusa, and spider angiomas

Diagnosis and Treatment Initial treatment for upper GI bleeding includes hemodynamic stabilization and

transfusion (packed RBCs, fresh frozen plasma, or platelets as indicated). Additionally, acid suppression (IV PPI reduces rebleeding rate and need for blood transfusion for ulcers) and prokinetic agents (erythromycin or metoclopramide improve visualization when endoscopy is performed) are given.

Treatment specific for suspected variceal bleeding includes antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (eg, ceftriaxone) and vasoactive agents (octreotide). Control of bleeding may be achieved with upper GI endoscopy (endoscopic variceal

ligation or sclerotherapy), which should be performed within 12 hours. This also confirms the diagnosis.

A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be required if endoscopic treatment fails or there is a high risk of rebleeding. Rarely, temporary treatments may be used in the interim until TIPS can be done (esophageal stent or balloon tamponade). Later sections of this chapter give more information on TIPS.
======================================
KEY FACT

Although upper GI endoscopy may confirm the diagnosis in acute upper GI bleeding, the best initial step is to stabilize the patient hemodynamically with fluids and transfusion, and

ensure the airway is protected.

Other Causes of Upper GI Bleeding Mallory-Weiss tear: Forced retching causes longitudinal intramural lacerations of the esophagus resulting in bleeding from the submucosa. Common causes: bulimia, alcohol use disorder, coughing, and hiccups. Dx/Tx: Diagnosis and treatment to stop bleeding are established on upper GI endoscopy. Many spontaneously resolve, and low-risk patients may be treated as outpatients. They may require fluid resuscitation, antiemetics, and endoscopic hemostasis, depending on presentation.

Boerhaave syndrome: Rupture of the esophagus causes vomiting or straining (increased intraesophageal pressure and decreased intrathoracic pressure). Hx/PE: Patients have retrosternal chest pain and crepitus. Sometimes there may be neck or back pain, upper abdominal pain, hoarseness of voice, dysphagia, or odynophagia. Patients deteriorate in hours and develop dyspnea, sepsis, and shock.

Dx: Contrast esophagogram or CT scan confirm the diagnosis. CXR may show mediastinal, subdiaphragmatic, or free peritoneal air; subcutaneous emphysema; pleural effusions; mediastinal widening; and other changes. However, it has low sensitivity.

Tx:

Free or large perforations in high-risk patients are handled with surgery or esophageal stenting (if surgery contraindicated). Contained or small perforations may not require surgery.

Dieulafoy lesion: An anatomic variant of a submucosal arteriole in the stomach wall. See Figure 2.6-14 for an endoscopic view of Dieulafoy lesion.

Hx/PE: Patients will present with painless bleeding from an unidentifiable source, and the condition can be either brisk or self-limited (yet prone to recur). NSAID use is typical and may incite bleeding.

Dx: EGD with visualization of bleeding or angiogram. Tx: Electrocoagulation during endoscopy is common, although many other options can

effectively treat this condition (eg, clips or epinephrine injection).
======================================
DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM

DYSPEPSIA

Commonly experienced; range of symptoms typically characterized by upper abdominal discomfort and/or pain after eating.

History/PE After eating or drinking, patients may experience early satiety, bloating, and/or epigastric pain or discomfort. Patient history suggests possible etiologies, although few patients will have an identifiable, underlying cause. However, history is important to consider when thinking of next best test. Malignancy: History of smoking and obstructive or constitutional symptoms (eg, weight

loss, night sweats, chills)

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): Pain and discomfort localized to epigastric area Drug induced: Symptoms coinciding with initiation of new drug (eg, NSAIDs,

bisphosphonates, antibiotics)

Biliary: Episodic pain localized to the right upper quadrant

Diagnosis Per Rome IV criteria, the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia is made when there is no evidence of structural disease and one or more of the following: Bothersome postprandial fullness or early satiety Bothersome epigastric pain or burning

of functional dyspepsia one or more of the. or early satiety burning should undergo endoscopy

When ruling out secondary dyspepsia: If >60 years of age, all patients should undergo endoscopy If <60 years of age, only patients with “red flag” symptoms should have endoscopy

Other etiologies should be pursued, based on patient-specific history. In absence of symptoms specific to a discussed etiology, consider Helicobacter pylori testing.

KEY FACT

Red flag symptoms of dyspepsia: progressive dysphagia, iron-deficiency anemia, odynophagia, palpable mass or lymphadenopathy, persistent vomiting, or a family history of GI malignancy.

Treatment Secondary causes should be treated with their respective therapies. However, if an identifiable cause is not found and the patient is negative for H pylori, patients may start PPI.

GASTRITIS

Chronic gastritis:

Type A (10%): Occurs in the fundus and is caused by autoantibodies to parietal cells. Causes pernicious anemia and is associated with other autoimmune disorders and ↑ risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumors.

Type B (90%): Occurs in the antrum and may be caused by NSAIDs or H pylori infection. Often asymptomatic but associated with ↑ risk for PUD and gastric cancer. Note: H pylori infection can, but does not always, cause gastritis.

KEY FACT

Type A gastritis is associated with pernicious anemia caused by lack of intrinsic factor necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12.

KEY FACT

H pylori antibodies stay ⊕ even when the infection is cleared. The urea breath test or a repeat stool antigen can serve as a test of cure.

KEY FACT

Stress ulcers include Curling ulcers, which are associated with burn injuries, and Cushing ulcers, which are associated with traumatic brain injury.

KEY FACT

Peptic ulcer disease and gastritis should be considered in older adult patients who are taking medications for arthritis or heart disease (eg, NSAIDs) and who present with abdominal pain or GI bleeding.

History/PE Asymptomatic or symptomatic with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, or melena.

Diagnosis Upper endoscopy is required to diagnose gastritis. Different tests for H pylori are shown in Table 2.6-6.

Treatment Patient should stop intake of exacerbating agents such as NSAIDs or alcohol. Antacids, sucralfate, H2 receptor blockers, and/or PPIs may help. Bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline, and metronidazole) can

treat H pylori infection. Other quadruple regimens include PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole.

Patients at risk for stress ulcers (eg, intensive care unit [ICU] patients) should receive prophylactic PPIs.

Risk factors: Diet high in nitrites and salt and low in fresh vegetables (antioxidants), H pylori colonization, and chronic gastritis.

Hx/PE: Early-stage disease usually asymptomatic, but may be associated with indigestion and loss of appetite.

Late-stage disease indicated by alarm symptoms: abdominal pain, weight loss, and upper GI bleeding.

Dx: Upper endoscopy with biopsy (most accurate test) to rule out other etiologies and confirm the diagnosis.

KEY FACT

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a rare gastric tumor that presents in patients with chronic H pylori infection. It is the only malignancy that can be cured with antibiotics. The physician should treat it with triple therapy.

KEY FACT

Gastric cancer may present with a Virchow node (an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node) or a Sister Mary Joseph node (a palpable lymph node near the umbilicus).

PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE

Results from damage to the gastric or duodenal mucosa caused by impaired mucosal defense and/or ↑ acidic gastric contents.

Risk factors: H pylori (>90% of duodenal ulcers and 70% of gastric ulcers), NSAIDs, alcohol and tobacco use; concomitant use of corticosteroids and NSAIDs; male sex

History/PE Presentation: Chronic or periodic dull, burning epigastric pain that is often related to meals and can radiate to the back; nausea; hematemesis (“coffee-ground” emesis); or melena (blood in the stool)

PE: Usually normal but may reveal epigastric tenderness and stool guaiac

Risks: Acute perforation (rigid abdomen, rebound tenderness, and/or guarding)

Diagnosis Most accurate test: Upper endoscopy with biopsy is the most accurate test. It can also be

used to test for H pylori infection and to rule out active bleeding or gastric adenocarcinoma (10% of gastric ulcers without perforation).

In recurrent or refractory cases, serum gastrin levels can screen for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Treatment Acute management: If perforation is suspected: An upright x-ray of the abdomen (initial test) to rule out free air under the diaphragm. CT (definitive test) if x-ray of the abdomen shows no perforation but there is high clinical suspicion. Surgery if perforation is confirmed on CT.

Ruling out active bleeding: Serial hemoglobin/hematocrits (initially), rectal vault exam, nasogastric (NG) suction. Monitoring blood pressure (BP) and treating with IV hydration, blood transfusion, and IV PPIs. An urgent EGD (definitive) to control suspected bleeding. If bleeding not controlled with EGD, may need surgery or coiling embolization to gastroduodenal artery.
======================================

Endoscopy with targeted biopsy: Indicated in patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapy to rule out gastric cancer

Surgical therapy (eg, parietal cell vagotomy): Severe cases refractory to medical therapy

KEY FACT

Uncomplicated, NSAID-induced ulcers are treated with PPIs. However, providers must routinely reassess for the need for NSAIDs and may consider switching to a COX-2 selective NSAID.

Complications Hemorrhage (most likely from posterior ulcers that erode into the gastroduodenal artery), gastric outlet obstruction (presenting with succussion splash), perforation, and intractable pain.

ZOLLINGER-ELLISON SYNDROME

gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine serum gastrin and large, burning abdominal pain; bleeding. syndrome dependent increase in gastrin levels

Rare condition characterized by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors in the duodenum and/or pancreas, leading to high serum gastrin and large, recurrent or intractable ulcers in the duodenum or jejunum. Hx/PE: Recurrent, gnawing, burning abdominal pain; diarrhea; nausea; vomiting; fatigue;

weakness; weight loss; and GI bleeding.

Dx: Diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome dependent on (1) fasting serum gastrin levels >1000 pg/mL and (2) increase in gastrin levels with the administration of secretin; in addition, pH <2.

CT indicated to characterize and stage disease Nuclear octreotide scan to facilitate localization of gastrinomas

Tx: Moderate- to high-dose PPIs to control symptoms. Surgical resection of the gastrinoma if not metastatic. Somatostatin analogs have also been shown to be effective for symptom control.
======================================
KEY FACT

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: Hypercalcemia from hyperparathyroidism Epigastric pain (peptic ulcer) Diarrhea (caused by mucosal damage and pancreatic enzyme inactivation)

GASTROPARESIS

Common cause of early satiety associated with delayed gastric emptying. Primarily caused by diabetes; other causes: idiopathy, viral infection, medication induction, and postsurgery status.

History/PE Patients typically have a long-term history of diabetes. Those who are insulin dependent experience nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and postprandial hypoglycemia due to delayed glucose absorption.

Diagnosis MRI or CT may help exclude other etiologies. Delayed gastric emptying on nuclear scan is diagnostic. Fluoroscopic upper GI evaluation can help rule out obstruction. An updated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) can assess glycemic control.

Treatment First-line treatments are hydration and diet modifications. Glycemic control is key. Pharmacologic treatments include prokinetics such as metoclopramide and macrolides. Antiemetics relieve nausea. Patients should avoid pramlintide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) agonists, which may worsen gastric emptying.

MÉNÉTRIER DISEASE

Characterized by large gastric folds due to hyperplasia of gastric mucosa and reduced gastric acid secretion.

presents with progressive

History/PE Typically seen in adult males and presents with progressive weight loss, vomiting, epigastric pain, and peripheral edema.

Diagnosis Large gastric folds revealed on endoscopy, but diagnosis made via gastric biopsy. Laboratory evaluation may reveal hypobilirubinemia and anemia.

Treatment No definitive treatment available. Management is typically supportive and entails diet modification (ie, high protein) and use of PPIs if associated bleeding is present. Patients require yearly endoscopy to screen for associated carcinoma.

GASTRIC BEZOAR

Gastric bezoars are foreign bodies made up of ingested material most commonly found in the stomach.

Their composition may include vegetable matter (phytobezoars), hair (trichobezoars, seen in patients with trichotillomania), and/or medications.

History/PE Patients may be asymptomatic initially, but they may insidiously develop symptoms such

as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, and weight loss.

Rare complications include gastric/small bowel obstruction (SBO), intussusception or perforation, peritonitis, protein-losing enteropathy, steatorrhea, obstructive jaundice,

pancreatitis, appendicitis, constipation, and pneumatosis intestinalis.

Physical examination may show abdominal mass (occasionally) or alopecia (trichobezoars).

Diagnosis Gastric bezoars are generally found incidentally on imaging such as abdominal x-ray,

barium swallow, abdominal ultrasound, or CT.

Definitive diagnosis occurs with upper GI endoscopy.

Treatment Treatment options include chemical dissolution (based on composition of bezoar) for

mildly symptomatic bezoars.

Endoscopic removal may be considered in more severe cases. Metoclopramide or other promotility drugs may be used as an adjuvant treatment with

chemical or endoscopic therapy.

Surgery is considered if other treatment options fail. Good hydration, dietary modification, chewing or psychiatric evaluation may be required

to prevent recurrence.
======================================
BARIATRIC SURGERY

is a procedure performed limiting caloric intake ability of the-body to procedures with here.

Generally speaking, bariatric surgery is a procedure performed to promote weight loss. These surgeries promote weight loss through limiting caloric intake (by decreasing the size of the stomach) and through decreasing the ability of the body to absorb nutrients (by shortening the length of the bowel). There are several procedures with which to achieve these goals, a few of the more common ones are discussed here.

Indications for Bariatric Surgery Most bariatric surgeons encourage/require patients to utilize lifestyle changes before surgery in addition to satisfying the following criteria to show true commitment to weight loss: 1. Body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2 2. BMI 35 to 39.9 kg/m2 with at least one serious comorbidity (type 2 diabetes mellitus

[DM], obstructive sleep apnea [OSA], Pickwickian syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, others)

3. BMI 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 with uncontrolled type 2 DM or metabolic syndrome

Types of Bariatric Surgery 1. Roux-n-Y gastric bypass: Division of the proximal stomach from the distal stomach and

division of the jejunum. The proximal portion of the stomach is then surgically anastomosed to the distal limb (the “Roux limb”) of the jejunum (gastrojejunal anastomosis). The proximal portion of the jejunum is surgically anastomosed to a more distal portion of the jejunum (jejunojejunal anastomosis), which was previously anastomosed to the proximal stomach.

2. Sleeve gastrectomy: Removal of one-third to two-thirds of the stomach surgically. 3. Adjustable gastric band: Placement of a silicone band around the stomach with an attached under-skin port. The port is able to be accessed for injections of saline to inflate/deflate the balloon, allowing adjustments to the band, if necessary.

Common complications: Dependent on the specific type of bariatric surgery. Common complications include acid reflux, cholelithiasis, malnutrition, leak at the surgical site, and dumping syndrome.

Dumping Syndrome Caused by rapid emptying of food from the stomach into the small bowel. The hyperosmolar content osmotically pulls fluids from the plasma into the bowel, causing hypotension and reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Hx/PE: Colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, tachycardia, and nausea Dx: Made clinically Tx: Avoiding simple sugars; increasing dietary fiber/protein; eating small, frequent meals;

separating consumption of solid from liquid foods by ~30 minutes

Px: Resolves on its own in 7 to 12 weeks

Organisms that cause watery diarrhea include Vibrio cholerae, rotavirus, enteropathogenic E coli (ETEC), Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and norovirus.

Treatment Acute diarrhea: Oral rehydration key. Antibiotics are not indicated (except in C difficile infection or in the epidemic setting) because they do not shorten the course of illness.

Chronic diarrhea: Treatment specific to etiology.
======================================
KEY FACT

Diarrhea after ingestion of raw eggs or dairy: think Salmonella.

MALABSORPTION/MALDIGESTION

Inability to absorb macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Presents with chronic diarrhea with weight loss, growth failure, and macronutrient and/or micronutrient deficiencies.

Celiac disease: Characterized by mucosal inflammation, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia in response to dietary gluten exposure. Celiac disease is associated with extraintestinal manifestations, including dermatitis herpetiformis (see Fig. 2.6-18) and autoimmune diseases of thyroid gland, liver, and type 1 diabetes.

FIGURE 2.6-18. Dermatitis herpetiformis. Grouped, papulovesicular, pruritic skin lesions are shown. Lesions tend to be symmetrically located on the extensor surfaces of the elbows, knees, buttocks, and posterior scalp and are associated with celiac disease.

screening and diagnosis and endomysial IgA biopsies is gold standard component, but testing

Diagnosis Serologic testing is crucial for screening and diagnosis and includes anti–tissue

transglutaminase-IgA (TTG-IgA) and endomysial IgA antibody testing.

Histologic analysis of duodenal biopsies is gold standard for diagnosis and grading based on Marsch classification.

Celiac disease has a strong genetic component, but testing for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 has limited role in diagnosis.

Management Lifelong adherence to gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of treatment and results in

symptom resolution and mucosal healing.

Concomitant testing for micronutrient deficiencies (iron, folic acid, vitamins D, B12) should be undertaken and repleted as needed.

Close monitoring for other autoimmune diseases (thyroid, liver, type 1 diabetes) and osteoporosis should be done.

Other etiologies of malabsorption: Mucosal abnormalities: Whipple disease (also presents with arthritis, lymphadenopathy, cardiac issues, periodic acid–Schiff [PAS]–positive granules in lamina propria on biopsy), tropical sprue (chronic diarrhea and nutritional malabsorption [vitamin B12 and vitamin B9] and living >1 month in an endemic area)

Bile salt deficiency: Ileal disease in Crohn disease or small bowel resections (>100 cm of terminal ileum), bacterial overgrowth

Short bowel syndrome: Caused by resection of small bowel; results in malabsorption of both micronutrients and macronutrients; amount of bowel resection weakly correlated to likelihood/degree of symptoms

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): Bacterial overgrowth due to various

causes, resulting in bloating or chronic watery diarrhea. Underlying etiologies include abnormal motility, abnormal anatomy (eg, after abdominal surgery, GI cancer), metabolic and systemic disorders (eg, diabetes), and immune disorders (eg, IgA deficiency)

Hx/PE: Presents with pale, foul-smelling, bulky stools (steatorrhea or fat maldigestion) associated with abdominal pain, flatus, bloating, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and fatigue.

The initial tests specific for celiac disease are IgA anti-transglutaminase antibody or antiendomysial antibody. The gold standard is intestinal biopsy, which will show increased intraepi-thelial lymphocytes (>25 per 100 enterocytes), crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy.

Dx: Multiple laboratory tests based on clinical suspicion. Biopsy is definitive. Tx: Etiology dependent. In severe cases, patients may require total parenteral nutrition (TPN), immunosuppressants, and anti-inflammatory medications. Dapsone can be used for dermatitis herpetiformis.

Lactase Deficiency Can be primary (autosomal recessive) or secondary (acquired conditions that affect structural or functional integrity of small bowel). Common among populations of African, Asian, and Native American descent, also

transiently after an acute episode of gastroenteritis.

Hx/PE: Presents with abdominal bloating, flatulence, cramping, and watery diarrhea following dairy ingestion.

Dx: Often treated empirically with lactose-free diet. Hydrogen breath test reveals ↑ hydrogen following the ingestion of lactose.

Tx: Avoidance of dairy products; oral lactase enzyme replacement.

Other Forms of Carbohydrate Maldigestion Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency: Rare homozygous recessive disorder with sucrose

maldigestion.

Maltase-glucoamylase deficiency. Fructose intolerance: Can be hereditary (presents in infancy) or dietary (later in life). No standardized diagnostic tests are available, but fructose breath test can be suggestive. Treatment involves restricting fructose in diet.

KEY FACT

Patients with carcinoid syndrome also develop niacin/vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) because tryptophan is metabolized into serotonin.

CARCINOID SYNDROME

Carcinoid syndrome is caused by metastasis of carcinoid tumors, which most commonly arise from the ileum and appendix and produce serotonin. Prior to metastasis, most secreted hormones undergo first-pass metabolism by the liver and do not cause systemic symptoms. Hx/PE: Cutaneous flushing, watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, wheezing, and right-

sided cardiac valvular lesions are the most common manifestations.

Dx: High urine levels (elevated 24-hour urinary excretion) of the serotonin metabolite 5- hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (best initial test) are diagnostic. CT and In-111 octreotide scans are used to localize the tumor.

Tx: Treatment includes octreotide for symptomatic patients and surgery in resectable disease.

The classic presentation of pellagra (deficiency in niacin/vitamin B3) is the 4 Ds: Diarrhea, Dementia, Dermatitis, and Death.

SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION

intussusception, gallstone ileus, stricture, and volvulus Partial SBO: Continued passage of flatus, but no stool Complete SBO: No passage of flatus or stool (obstipation)

KEY FACT

In the United States, the leading cause of SBO in children is hernia. The leading cause of SBO in adults is adhesions.

History/PE History: Crampy abdominal pain at 4- to 5-minute intervals. Vomiting typically follows

the pain.

Abdominal exam: Distention, tenderness, prior surgical scars, or hernias; hyperactive bowel sounds (high-pitched tinkles and peristaltic rushes).

Complications: Ischemic necrosis and bowel rupture with prolonged or complete obstruction. Patients present with peritonitis manifested by fever, hypotension, rebound tenderness, and tachycardia.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Abdominal x-ray demonstrates a stepladder pattern of dilated small

bowel loops, air-fluid levels (see Fig. 2.6-19), and a paucity of gas in the colon.

—<ooo | 6h obstruction.(A) Supine x-ray little gas in the

FIGURE 2.6-19. Small bowel obstruction. (A) Supine x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated air- filled small bowel loops with relatively little gas in the colon. (B) Left lateral decubitus x-ray on the same patient demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels (arrows) at different levels. These are typical plain film findings of complete SBO. (Reproduced with permission from Doherty GM. Current Diagnosis & Treatment: Surgery, 13th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

Most accurate test: CT scan of the abdomen further characterizes obstruction and evaluates for etiology.

Complete blood cell count (CBC) may demonstrate leukocytosis if there is ischemia or necrosis of bowel.

Lab tests often reveal dehydration. Lactic acidosis is a prognostic sign, as it suggests necrotic bowel.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Fluid resuscitation. Partial obstruction: Supportive care sufficient. It should include NPO status, NG suction,

IV hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, Foley catheterization to monitor fluid status, and pain management. Patient should avoid opioids and anticholinergics (slow GI motility).

Complete obstruction: Exploratory laparotomy indicated if there is presence of bowel necrosis, perforation, ischemia, or a surgically correctable cause of complete SBO. Otherwise, nonoperative management can be utilized for a period of time if the patient is

clinically stable.
======================================
KEY FACT

Gallstone ileus is a form of SBO that occurs when a gallstone lodges at the ileocecal valve after passing through a cholecystoenteric fistula.

ILEUS

Loss of peristalsis without structural obstruction.

Risk Factors Recent surgery/GI procedures, severe medical illness, immobility, hypokalemia or other electrolyte imbalances, hypothyroidism, DM, and medications that slow GI motility (eg, anticholinergics, opioids).

Q

A 53-year-old woman with a history of carcinoid tumor of the appendix (status post- resection) presents to a local clinic with symmetric, dry, hyperpigmented skin lesions and persistent diarrhea. Her husband expresses concern that the patient does not seem to be herself anymore; he reports that she has been irritable, confused, and forgetful. What is the most likely diagnosis?

KEY FACT

In ileus, there is air present throughout the small and large bowel on x-ray of the abdomen.

Diagnosis Must consider clinical history in diagnosis. Best initial test: Abdominal film showing distended loops of small and large bowel, with

air seen throughout the colon and rectum (SBO has no air distal to the obstruction).

Most accurate test: CT scan of the abdomen.

Treatment ↓ or discontinue the use of narcotics and any other drugs that reduce bowel motility. Bowel rest: Temporarily ↓ or discontinue oral feeds. Bowel decompression: Initiate low, intermittent NG suctions and parental feeds. Supportive care: Replete electrolytes as needed; hydrate with IV fluids.

ACUTE ABDOMEN

Any condition that presents with new-onset, severe abdominal pain and tenderness. These patients usually require surgery, but many nonsurgical mimics exist. A physician should always consider a gynecologic etiology in females and nonsurgical causes of acute abdomen (see Table 2.6-9) in all patients.
======================================
TABLE 2.6-9. Nonsurgical Causes of Acute Abdomen

ETIOLOGY CAUSE Extra-abdominal Myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism, pneumonia All of these cause right or left upper quadrant pain Hematologic Sickle cell crisis, leukemia Metabolic Diabetic ketoacidosis, uremia Genetic/familial Familial Mediterranean fever, acute intermittent porphyria Toxic Lead and heavy metal poisoning, black widow spider bite

History/PE In general, four pathologies contribute to acute abdomen and present with characteristic symptoms. Considering these mechanisms along with location and associated history/physical examination findings may help delineate the diagnosis.

The four pathologies are perforation/rupture, obstruction, inflammation, and ischemia. Perforation or rupture: Sudden onset of diffuse, excruciating pain. Patients will lie still

to minimize pain. Peritoneal signs are prominent.

Esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome): Has been associated with recurrent vomiting/hematemesis, but up to 45% of patients have no history of emesis. Esophageal perforation commonly presents with retrosternal and epigastric pain.

Other GI perforation: Associated with PUD, cancer, diverticulitis, and IBD. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): Most common in male smokers >65

years of age. Patient may describe periumbilical pain that radiates to the back. Abdominal exam may reveal pulsatile mass.

Pellagra, a deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin), secondary to a recurrent carcinoid tumor. Carcinoid tumors produce serotonin, which is a derivative of tryptophan. However, tryptophan is also the precursor of niacin. In patients with carcinoid tumors, the tumor can be so active that most tryptophan is used for serotonin production, resulting in niacin deficiency.

Ruptured ectopic pregnancy/ovarian cyst: Presents with first-trimester bleeding, abdominal pain, and hypovolemic shock. Abdominal pain is usually localized to the pelvis, but specific location and quality of pain are variable.
======================================
A

KEY FACT

β-Human chorionic gonadotropin (β-Hcg) is a vital sign in women with acute abdomen. ⊕ β- Hcg in the setting of shock is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.

Obstruction: Sudden onset of severe, colicky, intermittent pain. Patients cannot sit still. Peritoneal signs are usually absent.

SBO: Most commonly from adhesions years after abdominal surgery, incarcerated

hernias, or in patients with IBD or cancer. Patient may complain of obstipation (failure to pass stool or gas). Bowel sounds are high-pitched early in the disease process. Volvulus: Abdominal pain with insidious onset that is continuous, with intermittent

exacerbations associated with peristalsis. Patients also complain of nausea, distention, and obstipation. Immediate surgery is pursued in the presence of peritonitis or perforation. Otherwise, endoscopic detorsion may be used for management of sigmoid volvulus. Cecal volvulus is mostly treated surgically.

Ureteric/biliary obstruction: Nephrolithiasis causing colicky pain that usually radiates to the groin and may cause hematuria/pyuria. This condition may also cause costovertebral angle tenderness (CVAT). Biliary colic is most common in multiparous, overweight women (female, forty, fertile, and fat). Fatty meals exacerbate pain. There are no signs of peritoneal irritation.

cause of small bowel (over.10—12 hours) of lie still

KEY FACT

Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction in patients with a history of abdominal surgeries.

Inflammation: Gradual onset (over 10–12 hours) of constant, poorly localized pain that later localizes to problem area. Patients lie still to minimize pain. Peritoneal signs are prominent.

Appendicitis: Detailed later. Cholecystitis: Same demographics as biliary colic. Pain is constant. Peritoneal

irritation is evident. Murphy sign causes pain on inspiration.

Diverticulitis: Prominent left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain, change in bowel habits, and ± nausea/vomiting. Palpation or rectal exam may reveal mass (abscess).

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Associated with history of sexually transmitted diseases or occurring in young females with unsafe sexual practices. Pelvic exam elicits cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness. Ischemia: Variable presentation, dependent on specific etiology.

Acute mesenteric ischemia: Sudden onset of pain and hematochezia in a patient with history of atrial fibrillation.

Ischemic colitis: Postprandial abdominal pain ± hematochezia/melena in a patient with significant atherosclerotic disease (prior myocardial infarction [MI]/stroke, peripheral artery disease).

Strangulated hernia: Irreducible bulge in abdominal wall. Ovarian torsion: Sudden onset of adnexal pain ± nausea/vomiting. Character of pain

is variable. Palpation usually reveals a mass. Condition has a high index of suspicion in females since clinical presentation is variable.
======================================
KEY FACT

Acute abdominal pain with blood per rectum is acute mesenteric ischemia until proven otherwise. Classically, an older adult patient with a history of atrial fibrillation or recent AAA repair presents with these findings.

Diagnosis To rule out OB/GYN causes in women: Urine β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-Hcg) for ectopic pregnancy; pelvic ultrasound for ovarian torsion, ruptured cyst, or fibroids; pelvic exam ± swab for PID

To rule out extra-abdominal mimics in patients with upper abdominal pain: Troponins and ECG for MI, D-dimer/CT angiogram for pulmonary embolism, CXR for pneumonia

To rule out nonsurgical abdominal causes, if appropriate: Amylase/lipase in patient consistent with pancreatitis (nausea/vomiting, epigastric pain, hunched over), CT abdomen without contrast in patient consistent with kidney stones/pyelonephritis (hematuria, flank pain, radiation to groin), paracentesis for patient consistent with systolic blood pressure (ascites, fever)

Additional diagnostic tests to rule in surgical diagnoses:

X-ray of the abdomen: Perforation (see Fig. 2.6-20), SBO, volvulus

FIGURE 2.6-20. Pneumoperitoneum. Free gas under the right and left hemi-diaphragms visible in erect CXR. This may occur due to small bowel perforation.

J Clin Med Res 2013;5:2. doi: 10.4021/jocmr929w.)

CT with contrast: Appendicitis, diverticulitis, IBD, abscess, cancer, AAA Right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound: Cholecystitis, biliary colic,

choledocholithiasis

Management A detailed approach to management is beyond the scope of this section, but general concepts are as follows: In the presence of peritoneal signs or shock: Exploratory laparotomy.

All unstable patients and those with suspected potential hemorrhage: Blood typing, cross- matching and transfusion as needed.

Patients with perforation or signs of sepsis: Broad-spectrum antibiotics. Treatment with these antibiotics is also indicated for patients with suspected infectious processes (cholecystitis, diverticulitis, pyelonephritis).

Stable patients: Expectant management, possibly including NPO status, NG tube placement (for decompression of bowel in the setting of obstruction or acute pancreatitis), IV fluids, placement of a Foley catheter (to monitor urine output and fluid status), and vital sign monitoring with serial abdominal exams and serial labs.
======================================
DUODENAL HEMATOMA

Duodenal injuries are rare and involve the second part of the duodenum most commonly. Duodenal injuries are often accompanied by injuries to surrounding structures in the retroperitoneal region. Initial presentation can be nonspecific, and suspicion should arise in cases with direct blow or impact to the mid-abdomen.

Etiology In children, may result from a blunt trauma through bicycle handlebar or abuse. In adults, more often due to penetrating injuries (eg, gun shot, stabbing). Nonpenetrating injuries with duodenal hematoma in adults are typically due to steering wheel injuries.

are nonspecific. Patients emesis, with an inability leading to ‘delayed diagnosis. (due.to’ gradual fluid the-pattern of injury

History/PE Typically, signs and symptoms are nonspecific. Patients may have signs and symptoms of

GI obstruction such as bilious emesis, with an inability to tolerate oral intake.

Presentation is often insidious, leading to delayed diagnosis. Some patients develop

symptoms 48 hours after injury (due to gradual fluid shift into hyperosmotic hematoma). PE: Ecchymosis may be seen in the pattern of injury (crush injury with bicycle handlebar or seat belt sign), abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, or palpable upper abdominal mass.

Diagnosis Abdominal CT is the best initial test for duodenal injury in hemodynamically stable patients. Alternatively, upper GI series may be used (shows coiled spring sign or obstruction).

Patients who are hemodynamically unstable may be diagnosed during explorative laparotomy.

Pancreatic injury and other associated injuries should be excluded.

Treatment For blunt duodenal injuries, nonsurgical management in hemodynamically stable patients is recommended. Patients receive NG suction and TPN. Patients are followed with upper GI series or ultrasound at 5-day to 7-day intervals if signs of obstruction do not abate. Surgery may be considered if conservative management fails.

For penetrating duodenal injury, conservative management is not recommended, and patients should undergo surgery (duodenal repair, decompression, and other procedures).
======================================
MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA

Insufficient blood supply to the small intestine, resulting in ischemia and, potentially, necrosis. See Table 2.6-10 for clues to differentiating between types of ischemia. The most common causes are as follows:

TABLE 2.6-10. Differentiating Types of Mesenteric Ischemia

ACUTE MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA ISCHEMIC COLITIS CHRONIC MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA Site Etiology Symptoms Investigations Treatment Small intestine Thromboembolic (atherosclerosis, atrial fibril- lation, oral contraceptives) Cholesterol emboli after percutaneous vascular procedures Sudden-onset severe pain, diarrhea (bloody or nonbloody) Pain “out of proportion” to examination findings X-ray: ileus, may show portal venous gas or gas within the walls (pneumatosis intestinalis) CT angiogram— investigational method of choice Supportive measures with fluids; antibiotic therapy followed by surgery/embolectomy Large intestine, watershed zones (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction) Transient decrease in perfusion pressure due to decreased cardiac output (eg, dehydration, shock) Bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain X-ray: Thumbprinting of watershed areas of colon Optimization of cardiac output with fluids, treatment of shock Small and large intestine Fixed progressive obstruction in blood flow (eg, atheroscle- rosis of mesenteric vessels) Postprandial pain leading to fear of eating and weight loss Duplex ultrasonography May require revasculariza- tion, either surgical or percutaneous

originates in the heart. Risk thrombosis: Most The primary risk arterial. disease (atherosclerosis

Embolism: Most commonly originates in the heart. Risk factors include atrial fibrillation and stasis from ↓ ejection fraction.

Acute arterial occlusion from thrombosis: Most commonly occurs in the proximal superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The primary risk factor is atherosclerosis.

Other causes: Nonocclusive arterial disease (atherosclerosis of mesenteric vessels, arteriolar vasospasm), venous thrombosis (caused by hypercoagulable states), or shock state.

History/PE Presents with severe abdominal pain out of proportion to the examination, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, prior episodes of abdominal pain after eating (“intestinal angina”).

Diagnosis Best initial test: X-ray or CT scan of the abdomen may reveal bowel wall edema

(“thumbprinting”) and air within the bowel wall (pneumatosis intestinalis).

Most accurate test: Mesenteric/CT angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of arterial occlusive disease, but conventional angiography allows for intervention of thrombosis/embolism.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Volume resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics For acute arterial thrombosis or embolism: Anticoagulation and either laparotomy or

angioplasty

A 65-year-old male smoker is brought to the emergency department for sudden-onset abdominal and back pain. The anxious patient complains of “ripping pain.” Physical examination reveals a large, pulsatile mass behind the umbilicus. BP is 80/50 mm Hg; heart rate 125 beats per minute (bpm). The physician begins crystalloid and blood infusions. What is the most appropriate next step in management?
======================================
For venous thrombosis: Anticoagulation Surgery: Resection of infarcted bowel

Complications Sepsis/septic shock, multisystem organ failure, death

KEY FACT

Cholesterol embolism may occur after cardiac catheterization, and ischemia of multiple organs may be seen (bowel, kidney, pancreas, lower extremity skin causing livedo reticularis).

ACUTE APPENDICITIS

with subsequent.inflammation compromising of include hypertrophied (eg, carcinoid tumor), years of age), and the

Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen with subsequent inflammation and infection. Rising intraluminal pressure leads to vascular compromising of the appendix, ischemia, necrosis, and possible perforation. Etiologies include hypertrophied lymphoid tissue (55%–65%), fecalith (35%), foreign body, tumor (eg, carcinoid tumor), and parasites. Incidence peaks in the early teens (most patients 10–30 years of age), and the male-to-female ratio is 2:1.

Based on the clinical findings of shock, abdominal pain, and a pulsatile mass, the patient has a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which is a surgical emergency. If the patient is stable, ultrasonography or urgent CT are the next best steps and inform intervention; however, immediate laparotomy or endovascular repair should not be delayed in the unstable patient.

History/PE Classically presents with dull periumbilical pain lasting 1 to 12 hours with subsequent

migration to sharp right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain at McBurney point.

Can present with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Psoas, obturator, and Rovsing signs not sensitive tests, but their presence ↑ the likelihood

of appendicitis. Psoas abscess can present similarly to appendicitis, but with a more insidious onset over days. CT can distinguish between the two.

In perforated appendicitis, possibility of partial pain relief. Peritoneal signs (eg, rebound, guarding, hypotension, ↑ WBC count, fever) will ultimately develop.

Atypical presentations possible in children, older adults, pregnant patients, and those with retrocecal appendices. These may result in misdiagnosis and ↑ mortality. Atypical or nonspecific features include indigestion, flatulence, diarrhea, bowel irregularity, and
======================================
A

generalized malaise.

KEY FACT

The McBurney point is located one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. It is an important part of a physical examination because this location corresponds to the base of the appendix.

Diagnosis Appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis in patients with classic history (described earlier),

fever, and leukocytosis.

Investigation can occur with CT IV contrast (see Fig. 2.6-21) or RLQ ultrasound (preferred in children and pregnant patients).

FIGURE 2.6-21. Acute appendicitis. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrating an enlarged, hyperenhancing appendix with an appendicolith visualized in the lumen and periappendiceal fat stranding located anterior to the right posts muscle. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

Treatment IV antibiotics with anaerobic and gram ⊖ coverage (eg, cefoxitin or cefazolin plus

metronidazole). The patient should be NPO and receive IV hydration, analgesia, and antiemetics.

Uncomplicated appendicitis: Surgery or observation with antibiotics depending on the clinical scenario. If appendicitis not found, complete exploration of the abdomen is performed. There is no need to administer antibiotics postoperatively.

Perforation: Perform immediate open or laparoscopic appendectomy. Administer antibiotics postoperatively until the patient is afebrile with a normalized WBC count. If open approach is used, the incision should be closed by delayed primary closure.

Abscess: Broad-spectrum antibiotics and CT-guided drainage. Interval appendectomy should be performed 6 to 8 weeks after resolution of abscess.

KEY FACT

Surgical incisions can be closed by the following: Primary closure (primary intent): Surgical approximation using sutures or staples Secondary closure (secondary intent): No approximation, typically packed with gauze,

filled in with granulation tissue

Delayed primary closure (tertiary intent): Similar to primary closure; occurs after several days of observation to permit drainage

DISORDERS OF THE LARGE BOWEL

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS

Traced to spore-forming, toxin-producing, gram-positive anaerobic bacteria that colonize the colon after normal gut flora are disrupted by antibiotics (penicillins, quinolones, cephalosporins, clindamycin). Infection with C difficile classically affects adult patients in hospitals and nursing homes, as well as those with significant risk factors (eg, IBD).

History/PE It is typically associated with recent antibiotic usage. Additional risk factors include age >65 years, recent hospitalization, and use of PPIs. Symptoms range from asymptomatic carriage to profuse diarrhea (>3 watery loose stools

carriage to profuse pain, and possible systemic commonly causes colitis, in the stool sample. or show patchy erythema

in 24 hours), fever, abdominal pain, and possible systemic toxicity.

Infection with C difficile most commonly causes colitis, but it can involve the small bowel.

Diagnosis C difficile toxin can be identified in the stool sample. Sigmoidoscopy may be normal or show patchy erythema in mild cases and

pseudomembranes in severe cases.

KEY FACT

Lack of history of antibiotic usage does not exclude the possibility of C. difficile colitis. Leukocytosis in the absence of diarrhea in a hospitalized patient can be related to C. difficile colitis.

Treatment Cessation of the inciting antibiotic Nonsevere (WBC <15k, Cr <1.5): PO fidaxomicin or PO vancomycin First severe (WBC >15k, Cr >1.5): PO fidaxomicin > PO vancomycin Recurrent (first, second, and subsequent episodes): PO fidaxomicin > PO vancomycin and

Fulminant without ileus: PO vancomycin + parenteral metronidazole Fulminant with ileus: PO and rectal vancomycin + parenteral metronidazole

Complications Toxic megacolon presents with large bowel dilatation (>7 cm diameter in colon or >12 cm in

the cecum).

DIVERTICULAR DISEASE

Diverticula: Outpouching of mucosa and submucosa (false diverticula) that herniate through the colonic muscle layers in areas of high intraluminal pressure; most commonly found in the sigmoid colon

Diverticulosis: Presence of many diverticula—most common cause of acute lower GI bleeding in patients >40 years of age. Predominantly left-sided in Western countries. Bleeding usually results from weakened intestinal vasa recta vessels.

Diverticulitis Inflammation following microperforations secondary to fecalith impaction and high luminal pressure.

Risk factors: Diets that worsen constipation (eg, low fiber, red meat, and high-fat content), advanced age (65% occur in those >80 years of age), and connective tissue disorders.
======================================
KEY FACT

Diverticulosis is the most common cause of acute lower GI bleeding in patients >40 years of age.

Often asymptomatic which can cause symptoms with.chronic outpouchings.

History/PE Diverticulosis (see Fig. 2.6-22): Often asymptomatic until patients present with sudden, intermittent, painless bleeding, which can cause symptoms of anemia when bleeding is severe. Diverticulosis is associated with chronic constipation, which increases intraluminal pressure of the colon and worsens outpouchings.

Diverticulitis: LLQ abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Perforation is a serious complication that presents with peritonitis and shock.

Diagnosis Clinical history is important to diagnosis.

CBC may show leukocytosis or anemia. Most accurate test: Colonoscopy provides definitive diagnosis in diverticular disease;

however, sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy should be avoided in patients with acute diverticulitis because of the risk for perforation.

In acute diverticulitis, CT scan is the best test for diagnosis; it may reveal inflammation or abscess (see Fig. 2.6-23).

when there is clinical perforation.

KEY FACT

Sigmoidoscopy should be avoided when there is clinical and imaging evidence of diverticulitis because of the risk for perforation.

Treatment Uncomplicated diverticulosis: Routine follow-up is indicated. Patient should receive

encouragement to follow a high-fiber diet or take fiber supplements.

Diverticular bleeding: Bleeding usually stops spontaneously; physician should transfuse and hydrate patient as needed. If bleeding does not stop, hemostasis by colonoscopy, angiography with embolization, or surgery is indicated.

Diverticulitis: Treat with bowel rest (NPO), NG tube placement (if severe), and broad- spectrum antibiotics (if complicated, metronidazole and a fluoroquinolone or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin). Uncomplicated, left-sided diverticulitis may initially be treated in the outpatient setting without antibiotics. Colonoscopy can occur after the initial stage.

Hospitalization: If there is evidence of peritonitis or systemic signs of infection. For perforation: Immediate surgical resection of diseased bowel via a Hartmann

procedure with a temporary colostomy.

Complications Diverticulitis may cause fistulas in other organs, leading to pneumaturia, sterile pyuria, fecaluria, or fecal discharge from the vagina. The physician should diagnose with CT and treat with surgical resection.

3-6-9 Rule of Bowel Dilation In general, when the bowel is dilated greater than the following dimensions, physicians

consider it dilated. Obstruction should be considered.

Small bowel: <3 cm Large bowel/appendix: <6 cm/<6 mm Cecum: <9 cm

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Among the most common GI conditions seen in primary care and GI clinics, with a prevalence of 4% to 10%. IBS is an idiopathic functional disorder that commonly affects women in their 20s to 30s. Often patients have comorbid disorders such as depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia.

History/PE Patients with IBS present with abdominal pain that is related to bowel movements,

diarrhea and/or constipation, and abdominal distention. Symptoms often worsen with stress. It can be constipation predominant (IBS-C) or diarrheal predominant (IBS-D) or a combination of both.

KEY FACT

Imaging allows identification of small and large bowels according to anatomic locations and appearance. Small bowel: the plicae circularis stand out due to their thin, circular, circumferential mucosal folds. Large bowel: characteristic haustral markings formed by longitudinal and circular muscles.

FIGURE 2.6-24. Abdominal plain films. Supine (A) and upright (B) abdominal plain films demonstrate multiple loops of dilated small bowel (arrows in A) with air/fluid levels (arrows in B) in the right abdomen, suggestive of small bowel obstruction; this finding can also be seen as an unusual sign of acute appendicitis. Intestinal malrotation was not considered at this time. (Reproduced with permission from Welte FJ, Grosso M. Left-sided appendicitis in a patient with congenital gastrointestinal malrotation: A case report. J Med Case Rep. 2007;1:92..)

No alarm symptoms: Rarely awakens patients from sleep. Vomiting, significant weight loss, hematochezia, and constitutional symptoms are uncommon.

PE: Usually unremarkable.

Diagnosis Definition (per Rome IV diagnostic criteria): At least 4 days in 2 months of episodic

abdominal discomfort that is (one or more of the following criteria): (1) related to defecation; (2) associated with a change in stool frequency or consistency; (3) associated with a change in stool appearance.

There are no biomarkers or diagnostic tests currently available for IBS. Celiac disease should be ruled out in diarrhea-predominant IBS.

In children, usually abdominal pain that is not resolved with resolution of constipation. After appropriate evaluation, symptoms not fully explained by another medical condition.

Treatment Psychosocial: Patients benefit from a strong patient-physician relationship. Physicians

should offer reassurance and should not dismiss the symptoms.

Lifestyle: Consistent physical activity in the form of exercise has been shown to reduce severity of IBS-related symptoms.

Diet: Patients should avoid insoluble fiber and supplement their diets with soluble fiber (found in psyllium, oat bran, barley, and beans).

Chronic constipation may lead to anal fissures. Treat with topical anesthetics and vasodilators.

symptoms. Symptomatic treatment of IBS-C may include use of chloride channel activators (lubiprostone) or guanylate cyclase activators (linaclotide, plecanatide). Rifaximin may be used for treatment of IBS-D. Neuromodulators (eg, TCA/SNRI [serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]) may be used to treat both IBS-C and IBS- D.

COLORECTAL CANCER

mortality in the United 70 to 80 years of age. in Tables 2.6-12’and Colorectal Cancer COMMENTS

The second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. There is an ↑ incidence with age, with a peak incidence at 70 to 80 years of age. Risk factors and screening recommendations are summarized in Tables 2.6-12 and 2.6-13.

TABLE 2.6-12. Risk Factors for Colorectal Cancer

RISK FACTOR COMMENTS Age Risk T with age; peak incidence is at 70-80 years of age Hereditary polyposis Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 100% risk by 40 years syndromes of age); hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, also known as Lynch syndrome. Also risk for endometrial and ovarian cancers.) @ Family history Especially first-degree relatives < 60 years of age IBD Ulcerative colitis > Crohn disease Adenomatous polyps Villous > tubular; sessile > pedunculated High-fat, low-fiber diet, — alcohol, and sedentary lifestyle

TABLE 2.6-13. Screening Recommendations for Colorectal Cancer

RISK CATEGORY RECOMMENDATIONS No past medical or family history First-degree relative with colon cancer Starting at 45 years of age (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grade B): » Annual fecal occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or DNA-based stool tests (eg, Cologuard; in certain patients) = Colonoscopy every 10 years or = Sigmoidoscopy every 5 years Colonoscopy every 5 years, starting at 40 years of age, or co- lonoscopy every 5 years, starting 10 years before the age of affected family member at time of diagnosis (whichever comes first). Average-risk screening resumes at age 60. Inflammatory bowel disease Colonoscopy every 1-2 years starting 8-10 years after diagnosis Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome Colonoscopy every 1-2 years starting at 25 years of age Familial adenomatous polyposis Sigmoidoscopy every year starting at 12 years of age High-risk colonoscopy findings (eg, high-grade dysplasia, >1 cm, and villous component) Colonoscopy every 3-5 years

Sigmoidoscopy every year Colonoscopy every 3-5 years

History/PE Most patients are asymptomatic. In those who have symptoms, the location of the lesion varies. Right-sided lesions: Often bulky, ulcerating, exophytic masses that lead to anemia from

chronic occult blood loss. Patients may complain of weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, weakness, or vague abdominal pain. Obstruction is rare. (Right colon has a larger diameter than left colon.)

Left-sided lesions: Typically, “apple-core” obstructing masses (see Fig. 2.6-25). Patients complain of obstruction, change in bowel habits (eg, ↓ stool caliber, constipation, obstipation), and/or blood-streaked stools. (Left side has smaller diameter and thus is easier to obstruct.)

FIGURE 2.6-25. A carcinoma seen in the ascending colon during colonoscopy (A) and apple-core lesion seen on contrast enema imaging (B).

World J Surg Oncol. 2016;14[1]:273. Published 2016 Oct 26. Image B reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Rectal lesions: Usually present with bright-red blood per rectum, often with tenesmus and/or rectal pain. Rectal cancer must be ruled out in all patients with rectal bleeding. However, ⊖ fecal occult blood test (FOBT) has insufficient sensitivity to exclude the possibility of cancer.

Diagnosis Most accurate test: Colonoscopy with biopsy Evaluation for metastases: CXR, liver function tests (LFTs), and an abdominal/pelvic

CT

Staging based on the depth of tumor penetration into the bowel wall and the presence of lymph node involvement and distant metastases
======================================
KEY FACT

Iron-deficiency anemia in an older adult patient indicates colorectal cancer until proven

otherwise.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Surgical resection of the tumor (colectomy of varying length

depending on tumor size) ± radiation for rectal cancer

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy usually administered to reduce tumor burden

Follow-up with serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels to detect recurrence; colonoscopy 1 year after resection and every 3 to 5 years thereafter; LFTs, CXR, and abdominal CT to screen for metastases

COLORECTAL CANCER-ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS

Several genetically linked diseases may increase the risk of lower intestinal malignancy, including Lynch syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and juvenile polyposis syndrome.

Lynch Syndrome Also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Autosomal dominant disease that increases risk for Colorectal, Endometrial, Ovarian (“CEO”) cancers due to a mismatch-repair gene deficiency (eg, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM).

MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, medical history presents Physical examination murmur. Echocardiogram started. Blood
======================================
Q

A 60-year-old patient with no past medical history presents with fever, dyspnea, and orthopnea of 2 weeks’ duration. Physical examination reveals splinter hemorrhages and a new IV/VI diastolic decrescendo murmur. Echocardiogram confirms aortic valve endocarditis, and IV antibiotics are started. Blood cultures are ⊕ for Streptococcus bovis. What is the next diagnostic step?

Hx/PE: Patient aged <50 years with positive family history of colorectal (eg, three or more members) or associated cancers

Dx: Genetic testing for most commonly mutated genes (listed earlier) Tx: Colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years starting at age 20 to 25 years or 5 years prior to

earliest family Lynch diagnosis

Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Autosomal dominant disease that leads to benign, hamartomatous polyps. Although polyps are benign, patients remain at higher risk for GI, breast, and gynecologic cancers. Hx/PE: Numerous mucocutaneous pigmented macules and possibly a family history of

the associated cancers

Dx: Diagnosis with two of three clinical history criteria: family history of Peutz-Jeghers, presence of hyperpigmented macules (see Fig. 2.6-26), and/or hamartomatous polyps found in GI tract

FIGURE 2.6-26. A classic finding of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: pigmented macules on oral mucosa. (Reproduced with permission from Gondak RO, da Silva-Jorge R, Jorge J, Lopes MA, Vargas PA.

Dx: Occurs through genetic testing or presence of >100 colorectal polyps and classic skin and bone findings.

Tx: Screening for GI cancer with sigmoidoscopy every year, starting at 12 years of age (similar to that of FAP).

Turcot Syndrome FAP + brain tumors (eg, medulloblastoma) Hx/PE: Signs of neurologic deficit in the setting of positive family history or >100 polyps

found on colonoscopy

Dx: Genetic testing for APC mutation or mismatch-repair gene mutations (eg, MLH1 and PMS2)

Tx: Similar screening to FAP, as well as neurologic screenings (brain imaging for screening not typically done)

Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome (JPS) Autosomal dominant condition causing numerous hamartomatous polyps in the GI tract in young patients. Hx/PE: Most commonly presents in a young adult (<20 years) with rectal bleeding or

signs of anemia. May also have signs of obstruction or frequent diarrhea.

Dx: Endoscopy revealing one or more of the following: single polyp in someone with family history of JPS, >5 polyps found in colorectum, or multiple polyps anywhere else in GI tract.

Tx: Colonoscopy every 1 to 3 years or yearly if polyps are found; upper endoscopy every 2 to 3 years or yearly if polyps are found.
======================================
A

Colonoscopy is the next diagnostic step. Although the mechanism of association has yet to be determined, there is a well-established association between S. bovis and colon cancer. Clostridium septicum is also associated with colon cancer.

ISCHEMIC COLITIS

Insufficient blood supply to the colon that results in ischemia and, potentially, necrosis. Most commonly affects the left colon, particularly the “watershed area” at the splenic flexure (see Fig. 2.6-27 for anatomic illustration of watershed areas of the colon). Usually occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis.

Superior and inferior mesenteric artery Abdominal aorta watershed Superior mesenteric Splenic flexure artery Inferior mesenteric artery Hypogastric artery i {internal iliac artery) Inferior mesenteric and hypogastric artery watershed Rectosigmoid junction

FIGURE 2.6-27. Watershed areas of the GI tract. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

History/PE Presents with crampy lower abdominal pain followed by bloody diarrhea after meals or

exertion or in the heat. Fever and peritoneal signs suggest bowel necrosis.

Risk factors: Surgery that may reduce blood flow to colon (eg, AAA repair, coronary artery bypass), atherosclerosis risk factors (eg, diabetes and hypertension), hypercoagulability, and constipation.

Differential Acute mesenteric ischemia: History more suggestive of a thrombus or embolus in the setting of arrythmia or long-standing atherosclerosis. Infarction is not localized to

watershed areas.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia: Less acute presentation than ischemic colitis. Patient has history of food aversion due to postprandial pain.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CT scan with contrast possibly showing thickened bowel wall,

atherosclerosis

Most accurate test: Angiography Colonoscopy possibly showing a pale mucosa with petechial bleeding

Treatment Supportive therapy with bowel rest, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics Surgical bowel resection indicated for infarction, fulminant colitis, or obstruction

precedes the required Colonoscopy classically the patient has a collagenous lymphocytes if the lymphocytic

Diagnosis Evaluation of other causes typically precedes the required colonic biopsy to diagnose (eg, infectious, celiac, Crohn disease). Colonoscopy classically shows normal mucosa. Biopsy will show subepithelial collagen if the patient has a collagenous variant; alternatively, the biopsy will show intraepithelial lymphocytes if the lymphocytic variant.

Treatment The patient should avoid trigger medications (eg, NSAIDs, sertraline, PPIs). Supplemental antidiarrheals and short courses of glucocorticoids may be used if refractory.

ANORECTAL DISEASE

The rectum and anus have diverse pathology that can cause significant symptoms for patients, which can be distinguished based on presentation, exam, and risk factors (Table 2.6-14).

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE

Includes Crohn disease (see Fig. 2.6-28) and ulcerative colitis (see Fig. 2.6-29). See Table 2.6-15 for differentiation between the two diseases. See Figure 2.6-30 for anatomic distribution of diseases. Most common in Caucasians and those of Ashkenazi Jewish decent, with onset most frequently occurring in the teens to 50s. Table 2.6-9 summarizes the features of IBD. In patients with a history of Crohn disease and acute abdominal pain, the physician should suspect SBO, which is caused by transmural inflammation and stricture formation. Transmural inflammation in Crohn disease can also lead to fistula formation, abscesses, and draining sinuses. Ulcerative colitis does not cause fistulas.

HERNIAS

Inguinal hernias are protrusions of abdominal contents (usually the small intestine) into the inguinal region through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall. See Table 2.6-16 for comparisons of several different types of common hernias, including inguinal hernias.

TABLE 2.6-16. Types of Hernias

======================================
KEY FACT

Epigastric, umbilical, and anterior incisional hernias are all types of ventral hernias.

KEY FACT

The Hesselbach triangle is an area bounded by the inguinal ligament, the inferior epigastric artery, and the rectus abdominis.

Treatment

Because of the risk for incarceration and strangulation, surgical correction is indicated.

BILIARY DISEASE

CHOLELITHIASIS AND BILIARY COLIC

Colic results from transient cystic duct blockage from impacted stones. Although risk factors include the four Fs (Female, Fat, Fertile, and Forty), the disorder is common and can occur in any patient. Additional risk factors include use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), rapid weight loss, chronic hemolysis (pigment stones in sickle cell disease), small bowel resection (loss of enterohepatically circulated bile), and TPN. Table 2.6-17 details the forms of biliary disease and compares the laboratory findings associated with each one.

KEY FACT

Immunosuppressed patients (especially patients with diabetes) are at risk for emphysematous cholecystitis (infection of the gallbladder with gas-forming bacteria). This requires emergent chol-ecystectomy.

Diagnosis RUQ ultrasound is the best initial test and the most accurate test (see Fig. 2.6-31).

image of the (Reproduced with permission

FIGURE 2.6-31. Cholelithiasis. Ultrasound image of the gallbladder shows a gallstone (arrow) with posterior shadowing. L, Liver. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Treatment Cholecystectomy is curative and recommended for patients with symptomatic gallstones.

Asymptomatic gallstones do not require treatment. Lifestyle modifications may help aid in asymptomatic gallstone elimination (eg, reduced refined carbohydrates, adequate fiber intake, glycemic control in people with diabetes, weight loss at a modest pace).

Porcelain gallbladder (PGB), characterized by gallbladder calcification, is often (but not always) asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. Risk of gallbladder adenocarcinoma is increased. Cholecystectomy is indicated if symptomatic or asymptomatic with high-risk features (eg, spotty calcification) or low procedural risk (eg, young and fit).

Complications Postcholecystectomy syndrome can stem from retained stones, strictures, or extrabiliary causes. Symptoms include early satiety, bloating, and dyspepsia after cholecystectomy. Diagnosis is made with additional abdominal imaging (ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]).

CHOLECYSTITIS

Prolonged blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone, which leads to progressive distention,

inflammation, and infection. Acalculous cholecystitis occurs in the absence of cholelithiasis in patients who are chronically debilitated or critically ill.

History/PE History: RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. See Figure 2.6-32 for ultrasound

findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.

inspiratory arrest.with fever. the emergency department

Physical exam: RUQ tenderness, inspiratory arrest with deep palpation of the RUQ (Murphy sign), and low-grade fever.

A 43-year-old patient presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. They have complained of intermittent RUQ pain for the past several months. Physical examination reveals marked epigastric tenderness. Labs show leukocytosis, ↑ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and ↑ lipase. X-ray of the abdomen is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Diagnosis Best initial test: Ultrasound may reveal stones, bile sludge, pericholecystic fluid, a

thickened gallbladder wall, gas in the wall of the gallbladder, and/or an ultrasonic Murphy sign.

If ultrasound is equivocal, the next best step is a hepato-iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan. A nuclear imaging tool, it uses a radiotracer excreted through the biliary system. On HIDA, nonvisualization of the gallbladder suggests acute cholecystitis.

Treatment Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and IV fluids Cholecystectomy indicated
======================================
CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS

Gallstones in the common bile duct (CBD). Symptoms vary according to the degree of

obstruction, the duration of the obstruction, and the presence/severity of infection. Hx/PE: Biliary colic, jaundice, afebrile unless current infection, and/or pancreatitis Dx: ↑ alkaline phosphatase and total and direct bilirubin (see Table 2.6-17) Tx: ERCP with sphincterotomy followed by cholecystectomy

CHOLANGITIS

An acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree that commonly occurs secondary to obstruction, usually from gallstones (choledocholithiasis).

Other etiologies: Bile duct stricture, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and malignancy. Gram ⊖ enterics commonly identified pathogen.

History/PE Charcot triad—RUQ pain, jaundice, and fever/chills—is classic. Reynolds pentad—Charcot triad plus septic shock and altered mental status—may be

present in acute suppurative cholangitis.

Diagnosis Labs: Leukocytosis, ↑ bilirubin, and ↑ alkaline phosphatase (see Table 2.6-17); blood

cultures

Best initial test: Ultrasound diagnostic for CBD dilation Most accurate test: ERCP diagnostic and therapeutic

diagnostic for CBD dilation diagnostic and therapeutic for monitoring, cholangitis require

Treatment Patients often require ICU admission for monitoring, hydration, BP support, and broad-

spectrum IV antibiotic treatment.

Patients with acute suppurative cholangitis require emergent bile duct decompression via ERCP/sphincterotomy, percutaneous transhepatic drainage, or open decompression.

The most likely diagnosis is gallstone pancreatitis, which results from a gallstone that travels through the common bile duct (CBD) and lodges at the ampulla of Vater, thus obstructing the flow of both pancreatic exocrine enzymes and bile. It most commonly occurs in females, who often report a history of biliary colic. Treatment involves management of the pancreatitis with supportive care and elective cholecystectomy.

GALLSTONE ILEUS

Mechanical obstruction resulting from the passage of a large (>2.5 cm) stone into the bowel through a cholecystoduodenal fistula. Obstruction is often at the ileocecal valve.

Hx/PE: Classic presentation is a subacute SBO in an older adult female. Patients may have no history of biliary colic.

Dx: X-ray of the abdomen with characteristics of SBO and pneumobilia (gas in the biliary tree) confirming diagnosis. Upper GI barium contrast images will demonstrate no contrast in the colon.
======================================
A

Tx: Laparotomy with stone extraction; closure of the fistula and cholecystectomy

POSTCHOLECYSTECTOMY SYNDROME

Persistent abdominal pain and dyspepsia in a patient who has had a cholecystectomy. This syndrome may occur immediately after the procedure (early postcholecystectomy syndrome [PCS]) or months afterwards (late PCS). PCS can be caused by several conditions. One-half of patients have biliary, pancreatic, or GI disorders, and the other half have extraintestinal disease. Early PCS causes: Biliary injury, retained cystic duct, or CBD stones Late PCS causes: Recurrent CBD stones, bile duct stricture, inflamed cystic duct or

gallbladder remnant, papillary stenosis, or biliary dyskinesia (motor forms of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction)

Extrabiliary GI causes of PCS: IBS, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumors, pancreatic divisum, hepatitis, PUD, mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis, or esophageal diseases

Extraintestinal causes of PCS: Intercostal neuritis, wound neuroma, coronary artery disease (CAD), or psychomotor disorders

Hx/PE: Postoperative persistent abdominal pain and dyspepsia Dx: Imaging (eg, ultrasound, CT, or MRCP) to determine underlying cause of PCS (eg

recurrent stones, bile duct injury)

Tx: Tailored to underlying cause of PCS Prevention: Careful selection of patients who would benefit from cholecystectomy,

patients who would surgery against each in of the patient postcholecystectomy

weighing the risks/benefits of surgery against each in the context of underlying medical conditions and overall stability of the patient

KEY FACT

Bile acid diarrhea may be a part of postcholecystectomy syndrome. With the gallbladder no longer present, excess bile acids can enter the colon and continuous drainage can overcome the terminal ileum’s ability to reabsorb bile, causing diarrhea. Usually resolves on its own. Tx: cholestyramine or colestipol.

BILIARY CYST

Hx/PE: Most patients with biliary cysts will present before the age of 10 with the triad of abdominal pain, jaundice, and a palpable mass (not all will have all three in the triad). Other symptoms that may be seen include nausea/vomiting, pain, fever, and jaundice. Others may have cysts discovered incidentally on imaging.

Dx: Laboratory evaluation is often normal. If obstruction is present within the biliary system, there may be transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia.

Prognosis: Biliary cysts are associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, and surgical resection via Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy may be indicated.
======================================
CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA

Arise from squamous cells of the biliary epithelium. It has the potential to be highly lethal due to an insidious presentation. Symptoms typically arise when obstruction ensues from the growing tumor. Cholangiocarcinoma may be extrahepatic or intrahepatic, with intrahepatic

cholangiocarcinoma typically presenting even more insidiously (and often incidentally on imaging) than extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma will be discussed here. Risk factors: Patients may have history of PSC, fibropolycystic liver disease, chronic liver

disease, or parasitic exposure to liver flukes.

Hx/PE: Cholangiocarcinoma manifests itself with jaundice, pruritis, clay-colored stools, and dark urine. Patients may also have a dull/achy RUQ abdominal pain and weight loss. Laboratory evaluation will typically reveal hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and either normal or slightly elevated transaminase levels.

Dx: Tumor markers (CA 19-9, CEA, α-fetoprotein [AFP]), and abdominal imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRCP) raise suspicion for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. EUS with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or ERCP allows for tissue sampling to confirm the diagnosis.

Tx: Those with distal cholangiocarcinoma who meet criteria for surgical resection can have surgical resection performed via a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). Those who have evidence of metastasis may require chemoradiation.

several patterns, based aminotransferase and cholestatic bilirubin

Liver diseases can be divided into several patterns, based on LFT results as follows: Hepatocellular injury: ↑ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase

(ALT)

Cholestasis: ↑ alkaline phosphatase Mixed: Combination of hepatocellular and cholestatic picture Isolated hyperbilirubinemia: ↑ bilirubin Jaundice is a clinical sign that occurs when bilirubin levels exceed 2.5 mg/dL. Figures 2.6-33 and 2.6-34 summarize the clinical approach toward cholestasis and isolated hyperbilirubinemia.

HEPATITIS

Inflammation of the liver leading to cell injury and necrosis. Hepatitis can be either acute or chronic. Acute: Most common causes are viruses (hepatitis A virus [HAV], hepatitis B virus

[HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis D virus [HDV], hepatitis E virus [HEV]) and drugs (alcohol, acetaminophen, isoniazid [INH], methyldopa).

Fulminant: This is also known as acute liver failure. Severe liver injury with international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5 and hepatic encephalopathy in a patient without underlying chronic liver disease.

liver disease. causes are chronic viral alcohol, autoimmune «,-antitrypsin

Chronic: The most common causes are chronic viral infection (HCV most common in United States, HBV worldwide), alcohol, autoimmune hepatitis, and metabolic syndromes (Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency).

KEY FACT

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is Chronic; 70% to 80% of patients with HCV infection will develop chronic hepatitis.

History/PE Acute hepatitis:

Acute hepatitis often begins with a nonspecific viral prodrome (malaise, fever, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits) followed by jaundice and RUQ tenderness. Exam often reveals jaundice, scleral icterus, and tender hepatomegaly. HAV and HEV have only a self-limited acute phase; HBV and HCV may feature a

mild acute phase or none at all. Acetaminophen toxicity can cause a life-threatening hepatitis. Table 2.6-18 outlines further distinctions among these.

Chronic hepatitis: It may be asymptomatic, or it may cause fatigue and joint and muscle pains. Jaundice and complications of portal hypertension typically occur only when the disease progresses to cirrhosis. At least 80% of those infected with HCV and 10% of those with HBV in adulthood will develop persistent infection with chronic active hepatitis.

Q

A 21-year-old college student in the midst of final exams presents to a local clinic with “yellow eyes.” His physical exam is unremarkable except for scleral icterus, and a CBC and blood smear show no abnormalities. A comprehensive metabolic profile reveals a normal AST and ALT but elevated unconjugated bilirubin. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Diagnosis Acute hepatitis: Labs reveal markedly ↑ ALT and AST, ↑ gamma-glutamyl transferase

(GGT), ↑ ferritin, and ↑ bilirubin/alkaline phosphatase.

Chronic hepatitis: ALT and AST are either mildly elevated or even normal/low for >3 to 6 months, contrasting with the marked elevations of acute hepatitis.

Diagnosis of viral hepatitis is made by hepatitis serology (see Table 2.6-19 and Fig. 2.6-35 for a description and timing of serologic markers). The physician may require a liver biopsy if diagnosis is uncertain or to rule out other causes of liver disease in chronic or severe cases.

Other diagnostic studies include the following:

Autoimmune hepatitis: ⊕ Anti–nuclear and anti–smooth muscle antibodies (type 1) and anti–liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies and anti–liver cytosol antibodies (type 2). May also present with elevated serum gamma globulins (IgG) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA).

Hemochromatosis: ↑ ferritin and transferrin saturation >50%. Liver biopsy showing high hepatic iron index.

Wilson disease: ↓ ceruloplasmin, ↑ urine copper, Kayser-Fleischer rings. Liver biopsy if diagnosis uncertain.
======================================
MNEMONIC

An AST/ALT ratio >2 suggests alcohol hepatitis: you’re Toasted.

The most likely diagnosis is Gilbert syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin glucuronidation caused by ↓ activity of the enzyme glucuronyl transferase. Patients present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia but have a normal CBC, blood smear, and LFTs. The condition is benign, and no treatment is indicated.

Treatment Acute hepatitis: Generally supportive care. Possibility of acute HBV requiring treatment

with antivirals.

Alcoholic hepatitis: Treatment of alcohol withdrawal with benzodiazepines if showing signs of withdrawal, providing adequate hydration and supplementation to maintain nutritional status.

Drug-induced hepatitis: General treatment—removal of offending agent with exceptions, including use of N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and l-carnitine in the treatment of valproic acid overdose.

Chronic hepatitis: Etiology-specific treatment. Chronic HBV infection: Tenofovir and entecavir most commonly used, as they have the

highest barrier to resistance. Other agents, including telbivudine, adefovir, and lamivudine, are not recommended because of a high rate of resistance.

Chronic HCV infection: Varying medications and treatment duration, based on genotype, cirrhosis status, and history of prior treatment. Typically, either two direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) or one DAA plus ribavirin. Interferon is no longer used. This field is rapidly evolving.

Most definitive treatment: Liver transplantation for patients with end-stage liver failure. Emergent transplantation indicated in cases of fulminant hepatic failure.

KEY FACT

Hepatitis B postexposure prophylaxis: Nonimmunized individuals require both vaccination and immunoglobulins. Hepatitis B–immunized individuals and those exposed to hepatitis C do not require any postexposure prophylaxis.

A

KEY FACT

The sequelae of chronic hepatitis include cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
======================================
Complications Cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (3%–5%).

CIRRHOSIS

Generally speaking, cirrhosis is progressive fibrosis of liver parenchyma causing pathologic dysfunction resulting from chronic injury, which may arise by various means. Pathophysiology involves bridging fibrosis and nodular regeneration resulting from

chronic hepatic injury.

Most common etiologies in the United States are alcohol, chronic HCV, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Cirrhosis occurs in a progressive pattern, starting at a normal liver and eventually resulting in liver cirrhosis (see Fig. 2.6-36 for progression and Fig. 2.6-37 for a visual representation). Etiologies can be as follows:

Etiology of all causes of chronic hepatitis: Biliary tract disease (primary biliary cirrhosis, PSC); posthepatic causes, including right-sided heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, and Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulability).

History/PE May be asymptomatic, though may present with jaundice, easy bruising (coagulopathy),

and complications of portal hypertension such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (asterixis, altered mental status; see Table 2.6-20 for hepatic encephalopathy grading), gastroesophageal varices, hepatic hydrothorax (transudative pleural effusion), and thrombocytopenia. Ascites can be complicated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Tables 2.6-21 and 2.6-22 help differentiate ascitic fluid characteristics and their associated differential diagnoses.

May reveal an enlarged, palpable, or firm liver and other signs of portal hypertension and liver failure (Fig. 2.6-37).

KEY FACT

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and if they present with signs and symptoms suggestive of infection, paracentesis should be performed. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is diagnosed by >250

polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)/mm3 in the ascitic fluid.

Diagnosis Most accurate diagnostic test: Liver biopsy showing bridging fibrosis and nodular

regeneration

Alternative diagnostic tests: Biochemical (eg, AST:ALT ratio, APRI, FIB-4, thrombocytopenia, other proprietary tests [fibroscan, fibrosure]), and elastographic measures of fibrosis (fibroscan, MR elastography, US elastography).

Synthetic dysfunction: ↓ albumin, ↑ prothrombin time (PT)/INR, and ↑ bilirubin Portal hypertension: Thrombocytopenia (secondary to hypersplenism, sequestration of platelets in the liver, and ↓ thrombopoietin production), varices, ascites (paracentesis) Etiology: Hepatitis serologies, autoimmune markers, serum ferritin, ceruloplasmin, and

α1-antitrypsin

If ascites present, etiology of ascites determined by the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG = serum albumin–ascites albumin); see Table 2.6-20

Treatment The goal is to treat and prevent the progression of cirrhosis and minimize factors that can lead to decompensation (see Table 2.6-23). All cirrhotic patients should receive vaccinations for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and PPSV-23 (pneumonia).

======================================
KEY FACT

Hepatic encephalopathy manifestations range from changes in behavior to coma. Hepatic encephalopathy is graded, based on degree of symptomatology. Asterixis may be present.

SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is defined as an infection of the ascitic fluid, typically presenting in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The higher the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, the higher the risk of SBP.

KEY FACT

Common causes of SBP include perforation peritonitis (eg, perforated peptic ulcer), nonperforation peritonitis (eg, perinephric abscess), or translocation of GI flora.

History/PE SBP classically presents with fever, abdominal pain, chills, nausea, altered mental status,

and vomiting.

Patients may be asymptomatic (~13%–30% of patients have no signs or symptoms). Altered mental status is seen in approximately one-half of patients and does not correlate

with ammonia levels.

Lab abnormalities may include subtle leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and azotemia.

Etiologies Most common cause is Escherichia coli. Other organisms include Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumonia, Enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcus.

Pathogenesis Disturbance in gut flora is related to overgrowth and extraintestinal translocation. It is thought cirrhosis predisposes to a bacterial overgrowth because of altered small

intestinal motility.

Bacterial seeding is secondary to urinary tract infections, pneumococcal sepsis, cellulitis, pharyngitis, and dental infections.

Risk Factors Advanced cirrhosis Previous episode of SBP Variceal hemorrhage Total protein concentration <1g/dL in ascites fluid Serum total bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL GI bleed Use of PPIs

in ascites fluid analysis of cell count.

Diagnosis Paracentesis of ascitic fluid with analysis of cell count. Samples should be taken before

antibiotic administration.

Ascitic, blood, and urine cultures indicated. Elevated ascitic fluid absolute PMN count (>250 PMNs/mm3) is diagnostic. Evaluation needed for secondary causes of peritonitis.

Treatment IV antibiotics (third-generation cephalosporin) IV albumin for patients with renal dysfunction Prophylaxis with a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone to prevent

recurrence
======================================
KEY FACT

SBP prophylaxis is important in all cirrhotic patients admitted for a GI bleed/variceal hemorrhage due to the increased risk of bacterial translocation.

Prognosis Development of SBP is associated with poor 1-year prognosis due to its association with

advanced cirrhosis

Recurrence rates of SBP are close to 70%

ISCHEMIC HEPATITIS

Also called shock liver, hypoxic hepatitis, and hypoxic liver injury. Generally is diffuse hepatic injury resulting from acute hypoperfusion. Risk factors: Any type of shock. Hx/PE: History of shock (any kind of shock) or other acute causes of blood supply

interruption (eg, hepatic sickle cell crisis or hepatic artery thrombosis in those who have undergone liver transplantation or who have pre-existing portal vein thrombosis).

Dx: History of hypotensive episode followed by transaminitis with LFTs 25 to 250 times the normal levels (usually with AST and ALT >1000 units/L) and a massive rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Tx: Addressing underlying causes of ischemic insult. Prognosis: In the absence of continued ischemic insult, LFTs usually normalize in 7 to 10

days. The mortality rates are around 25% in ischemic hepatitis with shock (although mortality is mostly due to underlying cause of shock rather than hepatitis alone). Occasionally patients will progress to acute liver failure, where mortality rates range from 60% to 100%.

KEY FACT

that cause LFTs'to rise hepatitis, and ischemic

There are few causes of liver injury that cause LFTs to rise above 1000 units/L. These include drug-induced hepatitis, viral hepatitis, and ischemic hepatitis.

ACUTE LIVER FAILURE

Also called fulminant hepatic failure, acute hepatic necrosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and fulminant hepatitis. Characterized by severe acute liver injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and an elevated PT/INR (≥1.5) that develops in less than 26 weeks (versus chronic liver failure). The diagnosis may also be made in those with newly discovered Wilson disease, reactivation of chronic hepatitis B, or autoimmune hepatitis recognized in less than 26 weeks who also have cirrhosis.

Etiology: Many different etiologies, the most common of which are due to drug-induced and viral hepatitis

Hx/PE: Fatigue/malaise, lethargy, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, RUQ pain, pruritis, jaundice, abdominal distention (secondary to ascites), and hepatic encephalopathy

Dx: Must have elevated transaminases, hepatic encephalopathy (any grade), and prolonged PT (INR ≥1.5)

Tx: Diagnosing and treating the underlying cause of acute liver failure, transferring to ICU at a liver transplant center whenever possible, avoiding hepatotoxic medications, and addressing complications that can occur

Complications: Hemodynamic derangement, bleeding, malnutrition, electrolyte derangements (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, and hypoglycemia), hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema with associated increased intracranial pressure elevation, seizures, acute renal failure, and pulmonary edema/infections
======================================
KEY FACT

Those with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis, even if recognized in less than 26 weeks, are considered to have acute-on-chronic severe alcoholic hepatitis as opposed to acute liver failure, since there is usually a long history of alcohol use disorder.

HEPATORENAL SYNDROME

Acute kidney injury caused by acute or chronic liver disease causing fulminant renal failure. Pathogenesis: Arterial vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation (arteries supplying

visceral organs of the abdomen) secondary to portal hypertension–induced nitric oxide release. This is ultimately unable to be overcome by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to kidney injury.

Hx/PE: Underlying liver disease accompanied by a progressive rise in serum creatinine. Type 1: More serious; at least a twofold increase in serum creatinine to a level greater

than 2.5 mg/dL in less than 2 weeks.

Type 2: Kidney failure that is less severe than type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. The major

clinical feature of type 2 hepatorenal syndrome is ascites resistant to diuretics. Dx: One of exclusion, meaning other causes of potential kidney injury must be ruled out. Tx: Addressing underlying liver pathology and treating appropriately (if possible) in

addition to medical therapy/optimization. Those who do not respond may benefit from a TIPS procedure.

Those who.do SYNDROME ventilation/perfusion mismatch

HEPATOPULMONARY SYNDROME

Hypoxemia secondary to ventilation/perfusion mismatch caused by acute or chronic liver disease. Pathogenesis: As with hepatorenal syndrome, this is thought to be due to increased nitric oxide release due to portal hypertension. This results in dilation of pulmonary vasculature, leading to increased blood delivery to pulmonary circulation without an equal increase in ventilation. This results in blood being delivered to the left side of the heart that is inadequately oxygenated

Hx/PE: Underlying liver disease in addition to dyspnea (nonspecific), platypnea

(increased dyspnea while standing; relieved while recumbent), orthodeoxia (decreased oxygen saturation when moving from recumbent to standing position), and hypoxemia. Dx: One of exclusion, meaning other causes of hypoxemia and dyspnea should be ruled out. In general, those with underlying liver disease with impaired oxygenation (A-a gradient >20 mm Hg, PaO2 <70 mm Hg, and identified pulmonary vascular abnormalities identified on transthoracic contrast echocardiography.

adequate to monitor for worsening disease process; supplemental oxygen may be required if symptomatic. In those with severe to very severe disease, in addition to oxygen supplementation liver transplantation should be considered as well as TIPS. Liver transplantation is curative.
======================================
HEPATIC HYDROTHORAX

Generally speaking, hepatic hydrothorax is accumulation of ascitic fluid in the pleural cavity

in patients with underlying liver disease. Pathogenesis: Thought to be due to passage of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity

through diaphragm defects into the pleural cavity. Defects are usually <1 cm and associated with the tendinous portion of the diaphragm. Most often, hepatic hydrothorax occurs on the right side of the diaphragm due to the left side being more muscular and thicker.

Hx/PE: Typically presents with dyspnea (nonspecific), a nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and hypoxemia in a patient with underlying liver disease and ascites.

Dx: Identification of a pleural effusion on CXR and ruling out other causes of pleural effusion. Further evaluation via a thoracentesis with fluid studies revealing transudative fluid can be performed to further rule out other potential causes of plural effusion. Similar to evaluating SAAG in ascitic fluid, evaluating the serum-pleural albumin gradient should reveal a gradient of >1.1 g/dL because the fluid is ascitic fluid.

Tx: Similar to the treatment of ascites (sodium restriction and diuretics.) Additionally, therapeutic thoracentesis can be performed for symptom relief. In those with refractory hepatic hydrothorax, a TIPS procedure can be considered. In those who are not good candidates for TIPS, pleurodesis (chemical or mechanical obliteration of the pleural space to prevent accumulation of fluid/air), surgical repair of diaphragm defects, and liver transplantation may be considered.

TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT PROCEDURE

between the portal circulation sequalae of portal invasive procedure is suite, using wires portal vein.

Creates a low-resistance channel between the portal circulation and systemic circulation to reduce portal pressure and help treat sequalae of portal hypertension (eg, ascites, varices.) Generally speaking, this minimally invasive procedure is performed under fluoroscopic guidance in an interventional radiology suite, using wires and catheters to ultimately place a stent connecting a hepatic vein to a portal vein. Indications: Bleeding related to portal hypertension (eg, esophageal, gastric, or ectopic

varices), portal hypertensive gastropathy/intestineopathy, Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax, and refractory ascites

Absolute contraindications: Congestive heart failure (CHF), severe tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, polycystic liver disease, active systemic infection/sepsis, and unrelieved biliary obstruction

Postprocedural complications: Hepatic encephalopathy (secondary to increased ammonia in circulation; typically managed with rifaximin or lactulose), recurrent bleeding due to shunt stenosis/thrombosis (typically managed with angioplasty), and heart failure due to increased preload.
======================================
KEY FACT

Hepatopulmonary syndrome in portal hypertension may be from ↑ nitric oxide production → ↑ pulmonary vascular dilation and V/Q mismatch. Blood that flows through the pulmonary vasculature does not receive proper oxygenation due to an unchanged amount of ventilation from the lungs.

PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS

An idiopathic disorder characterized by progressive inflammation and fibrosis accompanied by strictures of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts. The disease usually presents in young males with ulcerative colitis. Patients are at increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma.

History/PE Presents with progressive jaundice, pruritus, and fatigue.

Diagnosis Laboratory findings including ↑ ALP and ↑ bilirubin; PSC also associated with p-ANCA

antibodies

Most accurate test: MRCP/ERCP showing multiple bile duct strictures and dilatations

(“beading”). MRCP is preferred initially as it is noninvasive. Liver biopsy revealing periductal sclerosis (“onion skinning”) Colonoscopy for all newly diagnosed patients to evaluate for IBD

Treatment ERCP with dilation and stenting of strictures. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to improve the liver function profile in some patients.

KEY FACT

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis.

PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS

Autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. Most commonly presents in middle-aged females with other autoimmune conditions. Hx/PE: Presents with progressive jaundice, pruritus, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies

(A, D, E, K)

Dx: Laboratory findings including ↑ ALP, ⊕ antimitochondrial antibody, and ↑ cholesterol Tx: Ursodeoxycholic acid (slows progression of disease) or obeticholic acid for those

intolerant of or unresponsive to ursodeoxycholic acid; cholestyramine for pruritus; liver transplantation

KEY FACT

Primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disease that presents with jaundice and pruritus in middle-aged females.
======================================
NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE

Steatosis of hepatocytes leading to liver injury. Some patients progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and are at risk for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. It is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Dx: Largely a diagnosis of exclusion. Liver biopsy may show steatosis or steatohepatitis. Tx: Weight loss, diet, and exercise. If NASH is present, the physician should consider

vitamin E and pioglitazone.

HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide despite its relatively low incidence in the United States. Metastatic disease (especially from colon cancer) is much more common than primary hepatic cancer.

Risk factors: In the United States, risk factors are cirrhosis (from alcohol, HCV, and NASH) and chronic hepatitis B (even without cirrhosis). In developing countries, HBV infection and aflatoxins (in various food sources) are major risk factors.

History/PE Patients commonly present with RUQ tenderness, abdominal distention, and signs of

chronic liver disease such as jaundice, easy bruising, and coagulopathy. The disease may present as decompensation of previously compensated cirrhosis.

Exam may reveal tender hepatomegaly.

Diagnosis Hepatocellular carcinoma is often suggested by the presence of a mass on ultrasound or CT, as well as by abnormal LFTs and significantly elevated AFP levels. Biopsy is required if diagnosis is uncertain, but can be deferred if imaging findings are highly suggestive of hepatocellular cancer.

imaging technically. feasible and in patients with cirrhosis criteria: single lesion chemoembolization (TACE)

Treatment Surgical: Partial hepatectomy if technically feasible and synthetic function preserved. An orthotopic liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis is preferred treatment if there are only a few small tumors (Milan criteria: single lesion <5 cm or three lesions <3 cm). Nonsurgical: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and/or radiofrequency ablation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, levatinib), immunotherapy (eg, atezolizumab), and anti- VEGF antibodies (eg, bevacizumab) may be indicated for advance metastatic disease.

May monitor AFP levels (if previously elevated) and use serial surveillance imaging (ultrasound, CT) to screen for recurrence.
======================================
KEY FACT

Hepatic adenomas (caused by oral contraceptives) are benign tumors and do not transform into malignancy.

HEMOCHROMATOSIS

A state of iron overload in which hemosiderin accumulates in the liver, pancreas (islet cells), heart, adrenal glands, and pituitary gland Primary hemochromatosis: An autosomal recessive disease characterized by mutations

in the HFE gene that result in excessive absorption of dietary iron

Secondary hemochromatosis: Occurs in patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy (eg, sickle cell disease or α-thalassemia)

History/PE Presentation with abdominal pain, DM, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (due to

deposition of hemosiderin in the pituitary), arthropathy of the metacarpophalangeal joints, heart failure, impotence, or cirrhosis.

Bronze skin pigmentation, cardiac dysfunction (CHF), hepatomegaly, and testicular atrophy. Labs may reveal evidence of DM.

Lung, kidney, or eye unaffected.

Diagnosis Best initial tests: Iron studies showing ↑ serum iron, percent saturation of iron, and

ferritin with ↓ serum transferrin. A transferrin saturation (serum iron divided by total iron- binding capacity [TIBC]) >45% is highly suggestive of iron overload.

Most accurate tests: HFE gene mutation screen (C282Y/H63D) and MRI; liver biopsy (most accurate test) to determine hepatic iron index.

Treatment Weekly phlebotomy to normalize serum iron levels (target ferritin between 50 and 100

mcg/L) and then maintenance phlebotomy every 2 to 4 months

Iron-chelating agents such as deferoxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox for maintenance therapy

restrictive cardiomyopathy, hypopituitarism. Patients with susceptibilityto-Vibrio (HEPATOLENTICULAR

Complications Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, DM, impotence, arthropathy, and hypopituitarism. Patients with hemochromatosis (and all patients with cirrhosis) have increased susceptibility to Vibrio vulnificus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Yersinia enterocolitica infections.

WILSON DISEASE (HEPATOLENTICULAR DEGENERATION)

An autosomal recessive disorder that results in defective copper transport and subsequent accumulation and deposition of copper in the liver and brain. Usually occurs in patients <30 years of age.

======================================
BENIGN LIVER LESIONS

Focal Nodular Hyperplasia Solitary liver lesion seen in females. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the second most common benign liver lesion. It typically occurs in response to a dystrophic artery, arteriovenous shunting, or congenital vascular malformation. Fibrosis develops in the center of the lesion, creating the characteristic stellate central scar surrounded peripherally by hyperplastic hepatocytes. Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging. Those with symptoms

tend to have nonspecific abdominal pain, but this is less common.

Dx: Seen on contrast-enhanced imaging as a peripherally enhancing lesion on arterial phase with characteristic central stellate appearance. On portal phase imaging, washout is visualized (see Fig. 2.6-39).

FIGURE 2.6-39. Contrast-enhanced arterial phase CT scan of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). (A) an axial view of the liver with FNH is seen during the arterial phase of contrast administration. (B), the portal phase is seen of this same liver lesions demonstrating washout (loss of brightness) of this lesion. (C) delayed imaging (taken after the portal venous phase) revealing further washout of the liver lesion. All three images reveal a hypodense, central, stellate-shaped region in this lesion.(Adapted with permission from Scialpi M, Pierotti L, Gravante S, et al. Split- bolus versus triphasic multidetector-row computed tomography technique in the diagnosis of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: A case report. J Med Case Rep. 2014;8:425.)

Tx: In asymptomatic individuals, no intervention necessary. For those who are symptomatic, recommendations for intervention may be made (eg, surgical resection, transarterial embolization, radiofrequency ablation).

The most likely diagnosis is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

Hepatic Hemangioma Aberrant collection of blood vessels within the liver. Pathogenesis not well understood, but thought to be due to congenital vascular lesions that develop into hemangiomas through the process of ectasia over time. Generally asymptomatic. Most common benign liver lesion Hx/PE: Typically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on contrast-enhanced

imaging.

Dx: Contrast-enhanced imaging revealing arterial phase enhancement with heterogenous washout on portal phase imaging.

should have follow-up; MRI should be performed in 6 to 12 months. If the lesion grows in size >3 mm per year on surveillance imaging, repeat surveillance imaging should be obtained in 6 to 12 months. If it continues to show a growth rate >3 mm/year, multidisciplinary evaluation for possible intervention should be obtained. If the lesion is stable (growth rate <3 mm/year), no further surveillance imaging is required.

Hepatic Adenoma (Hepatocellular Adenoma) Rare benign liver tumor with risk of rupture and subsequent intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Associated especially with use of oral contraceptives, but also associated with obesity, FAP, and glycogen storage diseases. Hx/PE: Tends to present asymptomatically in patients taking oral contraceptive

Adenoma) rupture and subsequent oral contraceptives, but asymptomatically in patients with,life-threatening sudden-onset severe

medications, but can also present with life-threatening intraperitoneal hemorrhage from adenoma rupture manifesting as sudden-onset severe abdominal pain with signs of hypotension.

Dx: May be discovered incidentally on imaging or in a patient with signs of hemorrhagic shock from adenoma rupture and subsequent intraperitoneal bleeding.
======================================
contraceptives and weight loss/lifestyle modifications to achieve ideal body weight in addition to 6-month surveillance imaging with contrast-enhanced MRI. If there is no increase in size on 6-month follow up, annual MRI surveillance imaging is recommended. If there is increase in size, surgical resection is recommend. For lesions >5 cm or symptomatic, surgical resection is recommended due to increased risk of hemorrhage.

Hepatic Abscess Liver abscesses are the most common visceral abscess. Most liver abscesses are polymicrobial, with most pathogens being mixed enteric facultative and anaerobic species. Risk factors: DM, underlying hepatobiliary/pancreatic disease, liver transplant, and

regular use of PPIs.

Hx/PE: Fever, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and malaise. Dx: Multiple space-occupying lesions on abdominal imaging. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis will typically reveal a well-defined lesion with peripheral rim-enhancement and central hypoattenuation (see Fig. 2.6-40); however, they can be loculated with subcollections and have an irregular border. Laboratory evaluation will likely reveal transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia. Definitive diagnosis can be made with image-

or by direct contact with animal hosts (dogs are definitive hosts).

Hx/PE: May cause asymptomatic incubation that lasts several years. Hydatid cysts only manifest with symptoms when they get large enough. Patients typically present with abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting.

round cyst, typically with “daughter” cysts, which may have echogenic material between the cysts. Imaging findings in combination with laboratory evaluation via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) serologic testing makes the diagnosis. In the absence of positive serologic tests, percutaneous aspiration or biopsy may be required to confirm the diagnosis.

Tx: Antiparasitic therapy in combination with either surgical resection or cyst aspiration.

PANCREATIC CYSTS

Pancreatic cysts are common incidental findings on imaging in older populations (>70 years of age). Hx/PE: Usually detected incidentally on imaging being performed for an unrelated reason. Dx: Most manageable with imaging surveillance. Some may require further workup, based

on presence/absence of “red flag features” on radiographic evaluation.

Red flag features include large size (>3 cm), solid components or calcifications, main pancreatic duct involvement (as evidenced by ductal dilation on imaging), or

thickened/irregular cystic walls.

The presence of these red flag signs increases risk of malignant transformation of the pancreatic cystic lesion and requires further workup via EUS-guided biopsy.

Occasionally, a surgeon may opt to immediately resect the lesion without prior biopsy if the lesion identified is determined to be very high risk.

KEY FACT

PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS (PNETs)

Insulinoma Results from insulin-producing tumor, associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1, usually benign.

triad: (1) documented sweating, palpitations, symptoms with correction insulin (elevated),

History Hypoglycemia satisfying Whipple triad: (1) documented hypoglycemia on a venipuncture; (2) associated symptoms, including sweating, palpitations, anxiety, tremors, headache, and confusion; and (3) resolution of symptoms with correction of hypoglycemia

Diagnosis Best initial test: Fasting serum insulin (elevated), C-peptide (elevated). Most accurate test: 72-hour fasting. Patient develops profound or symptomatic hypoglycemia after prolonged fast. Once hypoglycemia is reached, labs drawn to determine etiology include glucose, serum insulin level (elevated), C-peptide level (elevated), sulfonylurea screen (⊖), serum β-hydroxybutyrate level (low), and serum cortisol level (normal/elevated).

Treatment Surgery to resect tumor.
======================================
VIPoma Results from VIP-producing tumor; highly malignant.

History Watery diarrhea, dehydration, muscle weakness, flushing.

Diagnosis Stool sample: Low stool osmotic gap (ie, secretory diarrhea) Lab tests: High VIP levels, achlorhydria (since VIP inhibits gastrin secretion),

hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia

CT scan: Localization of tumor

Treatment Initially, replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses. Surgery to resect tumor. May also consider octreotide.

Somatostatinoma Results from somatostatin-producing tumor originating from D cells. May occur as part of MEN type 1 syndrome. Usually found in the pancreatic head but may also be found in the duodenum. Hx/PE: Generally speaking, symptoms nonspecific. Presents with abdominal pain and

weight loss. Rarely, presents with somatostatinoma syndrome, which should be suspected in those who have the triad of cholelithiasis, diarrhea/steatorrhea, and diabetes/glucose intolerance.

Dx: Usually found on imaging incidentally through the evaluation of abdominal pain. The best test to establishing diagnosis: EUS with FNA.

Tx: In those with nonmetastatic disease, surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Surgical resection is usually manageable with a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). Treatment in those with metastatic disease is dependent on the extent and location of metastasis. Symptomatic treatment with somatostatin analogs (eg, octreotide) to inhibit somatostatin secretion is also used.

Gastrinoma Results from gastrin-producing tumor originating from G cells. See “Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome” for more information.

PANCREATIC CANCER

Most (75%) are adenocarcinomas in the head of the pancreas. Risk factors include smoking, chronic pancreatitis, and a first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer. Incidence ↑ after 45 years of age; pancreatic cancer is slightly more common in males.

History/PE Abdominal pain radiating toward the back, obstructive jaundice, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, weakness, fatigue, and indigestion. Often asymptomatic and thus presents late in the disease course. In some patients, depression most prominent symptom.

May reveal a palpable, nontender gallbladder (Courvoisier sign) or migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau syndrome).
======================================
KEY FACT

The hallmark finding in pancreatic cancer is a nontender, palpable gallbladder and jaundice.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CT scan with contrast. Localization of the tumor and assessment of the extent of local invasion and distant metastases. Ultrasound of the abdomen initial test of choice if the patient suspected of having pancreatic cancer also has jaundice. If mass not visualized on CT/ultrasound, ERCP indicated. CA-19-9 often elevated, but is neither sensitive nor specific.

Treatment Locally advanced or metastatic disease: Most frequent presentation. Palliative

chemotherapy or best supportive care.

Small tumors in the pancreatic head with no metastasis or major vessel involvement: Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy).

Tumors in the body or tail of the pancreas with no metastasis or celiac artery involvement: Distal pancreatotomy and splenectomy. Chemotherapy with fluorouracil (5- FU) and gemcitabine to possibly improve short-term survival, but long-term prognosis poor (5%–10% 5-year survival). ERCP with stenting to relieve patients presenting with obstructive symptoms.

NORMAL HEMOSTASIS

Normal hemostasis is a regulated, dynamic process between thrombin-stimulated fibrin clot formation and plasmin-induced clot lysis. It is divided into three phases: vascular phase (spasm), platelet phase (plug), and coagulation phase.

The vascular phase is a brief contraction of blood vessels at the site of vessel injury. The platelet phase is first activated at the site of vascular injury to form a platelet plug. It

can be further subdivided into:

The adhesion of platelets to the disrupted endothelium, which is mediated by the binding of the platelet surface receptor GPIb to von Willebrand factor (vWF) The aggregation of platelets at the site of bleeding mediated by the binding of the

The aggregation of platelets at the site of bleeding mediated by the binding of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor on the platelet surface

platelet surface bleeding time further subdivided based factors.[factor VII and factors [factors VIII, IX,

GPIIb/IIIa receptor on the platelet surface Platelet function monitored by bleeding time

The coagulation phase can be further subdivided based on commonly obtained laboratory tests into:

The extrinsic pathway (fewer factors [factor VII and tissue factor] monitored by prothrombin time [PT]).

The intrinsic pathway (more factors [factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII] monitored by partial thromboplastin time [PTT]).

Both of these pathways converge into the common pathway (factors I, II, X, XIII). See Figure 2.7-1.

======================================
KEY FACT

Tissue plasminogen activators are contraindicated in: Active bleeding or risk of bleeding A known intracranial lesion Recent (<2 months) trauma or surgery to the spine or brain History of a hemorrhagic stroke or evidence of a nonhemorrhagic stroke in the past 3

months

In the setting of bleeding dysfunction, bleeding time PT and/or PTT may be prolonged, depending on the causes of bleeding.

Vascular injury leads to the release of vWF and tissue factor from subendothelial vessel walls.

vWF facilitates adhesion and aggregation of platelets, forming a platelet plug. Tissue factor triggers the coagulation cascade via the extrinsic pathway with factor VII.
======================================
KEY FACT

Enteric bacteria synthesize vitamin K. Neonates lack these bacteria and are prone to bleeding, which is why vitamin K is given at birth. Similarly, in children and adults, prolonged use of antibiotics could affect the normal flora,

and therefore antibiotics could increase the bleeding tendency.

Ultimately the platelet plug and coagulation cascade create a fibrin mesh, as shown in Figure 2.7-1. Common findings seen in platelet vs coagulation disorders can be found in Table 2.7-1. Drugs affecting the cascade are shown in Table 2.7-2.

warfarin is slow. Concurrent initiation with heparin is needed until warfarin dosing is adjusted to reach an international normalized ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range (2-3). In addition, proteins C and S have shorter half-lives than the other vitamin K–dependent factors (II, VII, IX, and X), leading to a transient period of paradoxical hypercoagulability before proper anticoagulation.

Warfarin vs DOAC pharmacology can be found in Table 2.7-3 and treatment of a supratherapeutic INR secondary to warfarin use can be found in Table 2.7-4.

INR 4.5-10 without bleeding Hold warfarin temporarily for few doses; can administer low-dose oral vitamin K. INR <4.5 without bleeding Hold the next dose of warfarin and readjust the mainte- nance dose of warfarin.

KEY FACT

The liver is the machinery responsible for synthesizing the vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors. Liver disease can therefore increase the bleeding tendency.

======================================
HEMOPHILIA

Clotting factor deficiencies of factors VIII (hemophilia A, 80% of cases); IX (hemophilia B); and XI (hemophilia C), which ↑ tendency to bleed. Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive genetic disorders (1:10,000 male births). Rarely, hemophilias can be acquired if antibodies against these factors are produced as a result of autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, or postpartum states.

KEY FACT

Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are X-linked recessive genetic disorders. Hemophilia C is most common in people with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, and it is often autosomal recessive.

History/PE Hemophilia presents in a young male (think child that is beginning to walk; 1–2 years of

age) with spontaneous bleeding into the tissues, muscles, and joints (hemarthrosis) that, if untreated, can lead to irreversible debilitating arthropathy and joint destruction caused by hemosiderin deposition, destruction of the cartilage and synovium (the lining of the joint), and fibrosis. Joint x-ray will show calcifications.

Spontaneous intracerebral, renal, retroperitoneal, and gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhages are also seen.

Mild cases may have major hemorrhage after surgery, trauma, or dental procedures, but they are otherwise asymptomatic.

Diagnosis Prolonged PTT (VIII, IX, and XI are all the factors of intrinsic pathway) on basic bleeding

workup. PT and bleeding time are normal.

Best initial test: Mixing study. Mixing the patient’s plasma with normal plasma will correct the PTT in hemophilia patients because normal plasma contains all clotting factors and will replace the missing clotting factor (Fig. 2.7-2).

In cases of acquired hemophilia, adding the missing factor will not correct the PTT due to the presence of antibodies directed at the missing factor.

Most accurate test: Specific factor assays for factors VII, VIII, IX, XI, and XII
======================================
KEY FACT

Cryoprecipitate consists mainly of factor VIII and fibrinogen, with smaller concentrations of factor XIII, Vwf, and fibronectin. It is a more concentrated source of factor VIII and fibrinogen than FFP.

Treatment Cases in which bleeding is severe or the factor level is ≤1% of normal (severe) call for

immediate transfusion with the missing factor; if that is unavailable, cryoprecipitate can be used.

If bleeding is not severe and factor level is >5% of normal (mild) or 1% to 5% of normal (moderate), hemophilia A may be treated with desmopressin, which releases factor VIII from the endothelial cells.

to screen other clotting factor concentrates the most common inherited dominant defect

Genetic counseling may be required to screen other family members. Prophylactic administration of clotting factor concentrates is the basis of modern treatment

of severe hemophilia A.

VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE

Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder (1% of the population). It results from an autosomal dominant defect or a deficiency in vWF with a potential decrease in the levels of factor VIII, which is carried by vWF (see Fig. 2.7-3). The three main roles of vWF are to (1) bring platelets to the exposed subendothelium, (2) aggregate platelets, and (3) bind to factor VIII. Symptoms of vWD are caused by platelet dysfunction and deficient factor VIII but are milder than in hemophilia.

The most common form of vWD is type 1 vWD (Mild to moderate quantitative deficiency in vWF). Type 2 vWD includes qualitative defects in vWF, and type 3 vWD is complete quantitative loss of vWF.

Heyde syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by the triad of aortic stenosis (AS), GI bleeding, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome, which results from the increased circulatory shear forces and subsequent cleavage and loss of vWF.
======================================
KEY FACT

vWD often presents with a positive family history of bleeding tendency, normal platelet count, and clinical manifestations of platelet dysfunction such as epistaxis, menorrhagia, and others.

KEY FACT

Reduced agglutination is seen on the ristocetin cofactor assay (detects vWF dysfunction); it is diagnostic of vWD and helps to distinguish it from other platelet disorders, such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome.

Diagnosis Best initial diagnostic test: Ristocetin cofactor assay of patient plasma diagnostic. It measures the capacity of vWF to agglutinate platelets and detects vWF dysfunction.

Additional diagnostic test: vWF antigen level. ↓ levels of antigen may be present. Factor

VIII levels can also be used to detect vWF dysfunction, but this is less specific. Initial bleeding workup showing an ↑ bleeding time in all vWD types. ↑ PTT as in

hemophilia may be seen, which is caused by low factor VIII levels. PT and platelet count will be normal.

endogenous vWF from storage sites in endothelial cells. For more severe disease, for major bleeds and surgery, and for those who do not respond to desmopressin such as type 2 vWD, patients should receive replacement therapy of vWF/factor VIII concentrates. Antifibrinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid can be used as

adjunct treatment for bleeding from mucosal sites such as the nose, oropharynx, and urogenital tract.

Control menorrhagia with oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Drugs to be avoided are ASA, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and platelet function inhibitors.
======================================
KEY FACT

VWD types 1 and 2 are generally inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. VWD type 3 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

HYPERCOAGULABLE STATES

Hypercoagulable states (thrombophilias or prothrombotic states) are an all-inclusive term describing conditions that ↑ a patient’s risk for developing thrombosis, usually venous thromboembolism (VTE) disease.

Etiology Etiologies can be genetic, acquired, or physiologic (see Table 2.7-6).

TABLE 2.7-6. Causes of Hypercoagulable States

States ACQUIRED Surgery Trauma Sepsis OCPs/hormone replacement

GENETIC ACQUIRED PHYSIOLOGIC Antithrombin Ill deficiency Surgery Pregnancy Protein C deficiency Trauma Age Protein S deficiency Sepsis Factor V Leiden Hyperhomocysteinemia (MTHFR gene mutation) Dysfibrinogenemia Plasminogen deficiency Prothrombin G20210A mutation OCPs/hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Malignancy Immobilization Antiphospholipid syndrome Nephrotic syndrome Inflammatory bowel disease Smoking Obesity Varicose veins Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD], decompensated cirrhosis)

History/PE Thrombophilias can present with recurrent thrombotic complications: deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Females may have recurrent miscarriages.

Diagnosis

Ruling out acquired causes of thrombosis before thrombophilia screening such as immobilization, surgery, OCPs, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy

Thrombophilia screening: To be considered only in patients with a history of VTE in the absence of risk factors and in patients with a first-degree relative who had VTE at <50 years of age or a first-degree relative with a diagnosis of thrombophilia

Hereditary abnormality confirmed with two abnormal values obtained while the patient is asymptomatic and untreated, with similar values obtained in two other family members Lab tests: Complete blood count (CBC), PT, thrombin time, PTT, fibrinogen, and assays

Treatment Patients with a hypercoagulable state with a provoked DVT or pulmonary embolism can

Patients with a hypercoagulable state with a provoked DVT or pulmonary embolism can be treated with heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, or a DOAC for 3 to 6 months for the first VTE event and lifelong anticoagulation for subsequent events.

be treated with heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, or a DOAC for 3 to 6 months for the first VTE event and lifelong anticoagulation for subsequent events. If anticoagulation is contraindicated (eg, recent trauma, hemorrhage, severe uncontrolled hypertension) or if patients have recurrent DVTs on therapeutic doses of anticoagulation, an inferior vena cava filter is the next best step.
======================================
ACTIVATED PROTEIN C (APC) RESISTANCE/FACTOR V LEIDEN

The most common cause of inherited thrombophilia. A single-point mutation in factor V, rendering it resistant to being inactivated/broken down by activated protein C. Risk for DVT or pulmonary embolism is ↑ 5-fold if heterozygous and 50-fold if homozygous.

KEY FACT

Protein C or S deficiency: Hypercoagulable state with skin or tissue necrosis following warfarin administration

History/PE Factor V Leiden: Young, White patients (<45 years of age) with a personal and family history of thrombosis (eg, multiple VTEs, unusual location, atypically young age)

Diagnosis Disease-specific tests: Factor V Leiden (APC resistance test) functional assay or genetic testing

KEY FACT

The liver is responsible for the synthesis of proteins C and S. In cases of decompensated cirrhosis, deficiency in protein C and S can cause a hypercoagulable state.

Treatment Factor V Leiden mutation: Direct oral anticoagulation without the need of monitoring INR. Can use warfarin for 6 months with a target INR of 2 to 3 in patients who trigger concerns about compliance with medication, in individuals taking medications that can interact with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), or in individuals who have extreme body weight due to

erratic absorption. OCPs should be avoided in patients with factor V Leiden.

HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (HIT)

A drop in platelet count more commonly observed due to unfractionated heparin (UFH) than to LMWH. It can happen with heparin or enoxaparin.

HIT type I: A mild, nonimmune-mediated transient decrease in platelet count that occurs 1 to 4 days after heparin initiation. The platelet nadir is typically ~100 k/µL This type of HIT is benign and requires only observation. No heparin interruption is required. HIT type II: An immunologic reaction due to the formation of platelet-activating

antibodies against heparin-prostaglandin (PG)4 antigen, which leads to the formation of blood clots and a drop in platelet count. It is usually a severe and rapid (>50%) drop in platelet count that occurs 5 to 10 days after starting heparin. HIT type II often presents as skin necrosis at the injection site of subcutaneous heparin. HIT rarely causes bleeding. Venous and arterial thromboses can occur; however, VTEs are more common. Heparin discontinuation is required, and a nonheparin anticoagulant must be initiated.

Treatment Discontinuing heparin immediately upon suspicion of diagnosis and starting a direct thrombin inhibitor (eg, fondaparinux, argatroban, and bivalirudin). Warfarin should be

commenced after a direct thrombin inhibitor is started and once platelet count is >150,000. Starting nonheparin anticoagulation is crucial to prevent arterial and venous clots.

Q 1

A 65-year-old male was recently admitted to the hospital for management of a DVT with heparin. Two days after his admission, he was found to have petechiae. Laboratory testing identified a drop in platelet count from 180,000 to 50,000. What is the best next step in management of his thrombo-cytopenia?

Q 2

A 33-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for anticoagulation after a pulmonary embolism. On day 4 of her stay, her platelet level ↓ from 150,000 to 60,000/mm3, and her INR remains <2. What is the next best step, and what complications can result from this condition?

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (20%–30%) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The main APS antibodies are the lupus anticoagulant, anti-beta-2-glycoprotein, and anticardiolipin. APS predisposes to both arterial and venous thrombi formation and spontaneous abortion (particularly associated with anticardiolipin antibodies). Laboratory testing shows a paradoxically prolonged PTT (only thrombophilia with an abnormality in the PTT).

History/PE APS: Most commonly in young and middle-aged females with recurrent miscarriages or thrombosis. Could have a history suggestive of SLE with photosensitivity, oral ulcers, patchy hair loss, and Raynaud phenomenon.

Diagnosis Diagnostic criteria for APS (at least one clinical and one laboratory criterion need to be met): Clinical criteria:
======================================
Evidence of vascular thrombosis events Any of the following pregnancy complications:

1. ≥1 spontaneous abortion of a normal fetus at or beyond 10 weeks gestational age (GA) 2. ≥1 premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before 34 weeks GA 3. Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before 10 weeks GA

unexplained by any maternal or paternal causes (anatomic, chromosomal or hormonal)

Laboratory criteria: Detection of lupus anticoagulant or anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I antibody or anticardiolipin antibody on two or more occasions, at least 2 weeks apart.

Laboratory testing showing a paradoxically prolonged PTT and normal PT. PTT does not correct with a mixing study due to the presence of antibodies. The addition of excess phospholipids can correct the prolonged PTT.

Disease-specific tests for APS: Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies.

Treatment For vascular events, treatment with LMWH or UFH and bridge to warfarin until the INR is in the therapeutic range. May require lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin. DOACs are less effective in APS.

Thromboprophylaxis is controversial in APS in the absence of vascular events.

KEY FACT

In patients with recent exposure to warfarin who are experiencing warfarin-induced skin necrosis, the physician should suspect protein C or S deficiency.

DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION

An acquired coagulopathy caused by deposition of fibrin in small blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and end-organ damage. Depletion of clotting factors and platelets leads to a bleeding diathesis. It is associated with many severe illnesses and is often seen in hospitalized patients.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can be acute or chronic.

KEY FACT

DIC is characterized by both thrombosis and hemorrhage.

This patient has HIT type I. The best next step is to discontinue heparin immediately and treat the DVT with a direct thrombin inhibitor.

2 A

This patient is experiencing HIT, which occurs secondary to the formation of antibodies that activate platelets. Because HIT can lead to a hypercoagulable state and subsequent thrombotic complications, heparin must be stopped immediately, and the patient must be switched to argatroban, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux.

History/PE Some common causes of DIC can be found in Table 2.7-7.

Clinical presentation: Acute DIC is observed with a recent history of trauma or sepsis or in patients with a

history of ABO-incompatible blood transfusions. It presents with bleeding; low platelet count and plasma fibrinogen; and a prolonged PT, PTT, and D-dimer.

Presents with shock and multiorgan dysfunction (renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and transient neurologic syndromes). Bleeding from venipuncture sites into organs, with ecchymoses and petechiae.

Chronic DIC is observed in patients with a chronic history of cancer; normal to low platelet count; normal to mildly high PT, PTT, and fibrinogen; and elevated D-dimer. It is often asymptomatic and can present with laboratory changes only. It can also present with venous or arterial thromboembolism without an identifiable precipitating factor.

KEY FACT

DIC is characterized by both thrombosis and hemorrhage.

Diagnosis Lab tests: ↑ PT and PTT, ↓ platelets (thrombocytopenia), ↑ d-dimer and fibrin, ↓

fibrinogen.

Possibility for DIC to be confused with liver disease. Unlike liver disease, factor VIII is depressed in DIC.

Treatment Treatment of the underlying cause; transfusion of RBCs, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP); and management of shock as necessary.

PLATELET DISORDERS
======================================
THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a deficiency of the vWF-cleaving enzyme (ADAMTS-13), resulting in abnormally large vWF multimers that aggregate platelets and create platelet microthrombi. These block small blood vessels, leading to end-organ damage.

RBCs are fragmented by contact with the microthrombi, leading to hemolysis (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) and thrombocytopenia. TTP is a medical emergency and can be immune-mediated or hereditary.

History/PE TTP: Associated with SLE, malignancy, pregnancy, cyclosporine, quinidine, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and AIDS. TTP can also be hereditary. Classic description involves a pentad of features. The physician should suspect TTP if three of five of the following symptoms are present (LMNOP):

1. Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) 2. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes (severe, often with jaundice) 3. Neurologic changes (delirium, seizure, stroke, ↓ consciousness, ↓ vision) 4. “Obsolete” (impaired) renal function (acute kidney injury [AKI]) 5. Pyrexia (fever)

Diagnosis General workup for thrombocytopenia can be found in Figure 2.7-4.

Lab tests: ↓ platelets, ↓ hemoglobin (Hb), ↑ creatinine, normal clotting/coagulation screen. PT, PTT, and fibrinogen are normal, which is different from the coagulation profile observed in DIC.

In addition, due to the hemolysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin are increased, while haptoglobin is decreased.

Blood film: Presence of schistocytes (fragmented RBCs) (see Fig. 2.7-5)

Most accurate diagnostic test: Measurement of ADAMTS-13 activity

Treatment TTP: Plasma exchange is the best initial treatment. Steroids and rituximab can be added to

↓ microthrombus formation.

Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in TTP, as additional platelets are consumed by the disease process, potentially worsening the patient’s condition.

in TTP, as additional worsening the patient’s SYNDROME and TTP have overlapping same disease that is caused secondary to
======================================
HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and TTP have overlapping clinical manifestations and are considered a spectrum of the same disease that is caused by ADAMTS-13 deficiency, which is either inherited or often acquired secondary to infection. TTP is more common in adults, and HUS is frequently seen in children (associated with Escherichia coli 0157:H7).

HUS: Can present similarly to TTP with the absence of neurologic features.

>90% of cases in children are caused by E coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic diarrhea, which precedes the syndrome. The E coli infection is triggered by eating undercooked, contaminated meat.

Characterized by renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and low platelets without neurologic symptoms.

Abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and AKI often seen. Severe ↑ in creatinine levels is more typical of HUS than of TTP.

Schistocytes (fragmented RBCs) seen in both HUS and TTP.

Diagnosis Lab tests: ↓ platelets, ↓ Hb, ↑ creatinine, normal clotting/coagulation screen. PT, PTT, and fibrinogen are normal, which is different from the coagulation profile observed in DIC.

In addition, due to the hemolysis, LDH and indirect bilirubin are increased, whereas haptoglobin is decreased.

Blood film: Presence of schistocytes (fragmented RBCs) (see Fig. 2.7-5).

Treatment HUS: Dialysis for AKI may be needed. Plasma exchange is used for severe, persistent

disease. Antibiotics and antimotility drugs such as anticholinergics are not recommended, as they have been shown to increase the likelihood of HUS resulting from E coli O157:H7.

One other key point is that hydration can help reduce the risk of AKI. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in HUS, as additional platelets are consumed by the

disease process, potentially worsening the patient’s condition.

A summary of the clinical and laboratory findings seen in TTP, HUS and DIC can be found in Table 2.7-8 and the common laboratory features seen in different bleeding disorders can be seen in Table 2.7-9.

Q

An 8-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with 2 days of fever, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and irritability. She began feeling unwell after attending a classmate’s birthday party. Laboratory results reveal thrombocytopenia, ↑ creatinine level, and schistocytes. What is the next best step?

IDIOPATHIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA)

the membrane protein the spleen. Bone marrow is the most-common systemic symptoms.

IgG antibodies are formed against the membrane protein Gp Iib/IIIa of platelets. The platelet- antibody complex is destroyed by the spleen. Bone marrow production of platelets is ↑, with ↑ megakaryocytes in the marrow. It is the most common immunologic disorder in females of childbearing age.

History/PE Patients often feel well with no systemic symptoms. They may have minor mucocutaneous

bleeding, easy bruising, petechiae, hematuria, or melena. Generally there is no splenomegaly. (Splenomegaly can also cause platelet sequestration resulting in thrombocytopenia, generally seen in myeloproliferative disorders, infections like malaria, and visceral leishmaniasis.)

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is associated with a range of conditions,

including malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia), autoimmune disorders (SLE), and viral infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus [HCV]). It can present acutely or as a chronic illness. Acute: Abrupt onset of hemorrhagic complications occurs after a viral illness with sudden, self-limiting purpura. It commonly affects children 2 to 6 years of age, with boys and girls affected equally.

Chronic: Insidious onset of symptoms occurs, or CBC shows incidental thrombocytopenia. There is a fluctuating course of bleeding, purpura, epistaxis, and menorrhagia. It affects adults 20 to 40 years of age and females more than males.

HUS is the most common cause of acute renal failure in children. Supportive therapy includes intravenous (IV) fluids, blood pressure (BP) control, blood transfusion, and, if necessary, dialysis. Antibiotics are not indicated, as they are thought to ↓ expulsion of the toxin and may ↑ toxin from the destruction of bacteria.
======================================
A

Diagnosis The diagnosis is one of exclusion. Once other causes of thrombocytopenia have been ruled out, diagnosis can occur via history and PE, a CBC, and a peripheral blood smear showing megakaryocytes and normal RBC morphology.

It is important to rule out pseudothrombocytopenia due to platelet clumping by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in test tubes.

Antiplatelet antibodies are often present. Bone marrow biopsy would also show ↑ megakaryocytes but is done only in atypical cases

or patients >60 years of age.

Additional tests for all patients with ITP include HIV (5%–10% of chronic HIV patients may present with isolated thrombocytopenia), hepatitis C, Helicobacter pylori, direct antiglobulin test, and blood type.

KEY FACT

Anti-D (Rh) immunoglobulin and rituximab are second-line therapies for ITP. Anti-D (Rh) immunoglobulin and IVIG act as “decoys” so that WBCs will recognize them instead of IgG on platelets.

bleeding: No treatment significant bleeding (IVIG) or bleeding recurs, the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor

Treatment Platelet count >30,000 and no bleeding: No treatment required Platelet count <30,000 or clinically significant bleeding symptoms: Corticosteroids or

intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

If platelet count fails to improve or bleeding recurs, the physician should consider splenectomy ± rituximab ± thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist to ↑ platelet production (romiplostim or eltrombopag).

Platelet transfusions are not used (except during splenectomy or life-threatening hemorrhage), as the platelets are quickly destroyed by autoantibodies.

If caused by HCV or HIV, treatment of the underlying infection can improve platelet count.

In pregnant patients, severe thrombocytopenia may occur in the fetus.

KEY FACT

Steroid-sparing therapies are generally agents used as alternatives to avoid steroid-related adverse events such as high blood sugar and osteoporosis.

MICROCYTIC ANEMIAs

Iron Deficiency Anemia Occurs due to ↑ demand (eg, growing period, pregnancy, erythropoietin [EPO] therapy) or ↓ iron due to chronic bleeding (menorrhagia, GI loss), malnutrition/absorption disorders (eg, celiac disease), and GI surgery (eg, gastrectomy). Toddlers, adolescent females, and females of reproductive age constitute high-risk groups.

KEY FACT

Microcytic anemias, or microcytosis, have a low MCV (<80 Fl) and generally have a low reticulocyte count.

History/PE Symptoms: Fatigue, dyspnea, tachycardia, angina, syncope, and pica (persistent craving

and compulsive eating of nonfood substances).

Physical findings: Glossitis, cheilosis, conjunctival pallor, and koilonychia (“spoon nails,” see Fig. 2.7-7), Plummer-Vinson syndrome (triad of iron deficiency anemia,

esophageal webs, and dysphagia).

FIGURE 2.7-7. Koilonychia (spoon nails). The fingernail plate is concave. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K, et al. Fitzpatrick’s Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology. New York, NY: McGraw- Hill; 2013.)

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC (↓ MCV, ↓ mean corpuscular Hb [MCH], ↓ mean corpuscular Hb concentration [MCHC]) with iron profile (see Table 2.7-10). Iron deficiency anemia should be distinguished from thalassemia and anemia of chronic disease.

TABLE 2.7-10. Iron Deficiency Anemia vs Anemia of Chronic Disease vs. Thalassemia

Most accurate test: Bone marrow iron stain (Prussian blue stain). Peripheral blood smear can show microcytic, hypochromic RBCs (see Fig. 2.7-8) with

anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and a low reticulocyte count.

======================================
KEY FACT

Iron deficiency anemia in an older adult patient may be caused by colorectal cancer until proven otherwise and must therefore be evaluated to rule out malignancy.

MNEMONIC

Causes of microcytic anemia— IRON LAST IRON deficiency Lead poisoning Anemia of chronic disease Sideroblastic anemia Thalassemia 

Treatment Iron supplementation. Oral iron is preferred over IV iron. Duration of oral iron replacement to replenish stores depends on iron deficit (6 weeks to 6 months).

Oral iron may lead to nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and black stools. Alternate-day therapy can minimize GI adverse effects. Antacids may interfere with iron absorption.

IV iron is preferred if the oral route is ineffective (eg, gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, GI malabsorption, post–gastric bypass surgery, hyperemesis gravidarum, and a history of oral iron intolerance).

IV iron is superior to oral iron in achieving a sustained Hb response; reducing the need for packed RBC transfusions; and improving the quality of life for patients with chronic heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis, and cancer- related anemia.

IV iron dextran is associated with a small risk for serious adverse effects, including anaphylaxis. Iron sucrose may be associated with a lower risk for allergy.
======================================
KEY FACT

Anemia secondary to end-stage renal disease is caused by deficiency of EPO. Treatment

with recombinant EPO is effective but often leads to worsening of hypertension.

Anemia of Chronic Inflammation/Disease To limit bacterial proliferation, the body “hides” or “locks” its iron in situations of chronic inflammation such as infection, malignancy, RA, or SLE. Iron is trapped in macrophages or in ferritin (↑ in inflammation). This results in a microcytic or normocytic anemia with normal or ↑ levels of iron storage in the form of ferritin but ↓ serum iron and ↓ total iron binding capacity (TIBC) (see Table 2.7-4). Treatment consists of treating the underlying disease. Anemia associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) responds to EPO replacement, once iron stores have been repleted.

Lead Poisoning Inhibits ferrochelatase and δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase → ↓ heme synthesis and ↑ RBC protoporphyrin. Also inhibits ribosomal RNA (Rrna) degradation → RBCs retain aggregates of Rrna (basophilic stippling). Exposure risk ↑ in adults because of inhalation during industrial work (battery factory) and in children because of eating lead paint (old houses with chipped paint built before 1978). History/PE: Symptoms of LEAD poisoning include:

Lead Lines on gingivae (Burton lines) and on metaphyses of long bones on x-ray Encephalopathy and Erythrocyte basophilic stippling Abdominal pain (lead colic) and sideroblastic Anemia Drops—wrist and foot drops

Dx: Presence of ringed sideroblasts (with iron-laden, Prussian blue–stained mitochondria) on bone marrow smear is diagnostic (see Fig. 2.7-9).

Thalassemias Hereditary disorders involving ↓ or absent production of normal globin chains of Hb. α- Thalassemia is caused by a gene deletion of one or more of the four genes that encode α- hemoglobin. β-Thalassemia results from a point mutation of one or both of the two genes encoding β-hemoglobin.

History/PE Thalassemia is most common among people of African, Middle Eastern, and Asian descent. Disease presentation varies with the number of genes missing (see Table 2.7-11). A typical case can be an asymptomatic or fatigued individual with a microcytic anemia and normal iron studies.

TABLE 2.7-11. Differential Diagnosis of Thalassemias

NUMBER OF GENES SUBTYPE PRESENT CLINICAL FEATURES B-thalassemia 0/28 Patients develop severe microcytic anemia and failure to major (Cooley thrive during late infancy (6-12 months) due to HbF to anemia) HbA transition. Patients need lifelong chronic transfusions or marrow transplant to survive. Extramedullary hemo- poiesis occurs in response to anemia (eg, skull bossing, hepatosplenomegaly). B-thalassemia 1/2B Patients are asymptomatic with mild to moderate and minor well-tolerated anemia, but their cells are microcytic and hypochromic on peripheral smear.

Diagnosis Most accurate test is Hb electrophoresis (normal in α trait, α silent carrier). For α-thalassemia, genetic studies are the most accurate tests. All forms of thalassemia have a normal red cell distribution width (RDW). Only three-gene deletion α-thalassemia is associated with Hb H and ↑ reticulocyte count.

Treatment Most patients do not require treatment (trait is not treated). Those with β-thalassemia major and Hb H disease are often transfusion dependent

(chronic, lifelong transfusion) and require oral iron chelators (deferasirox or deferiprone)

or a parenteral iron chelator (deferoxamine) to prevent overload.
======================================
KEY FACT

Mentzer index: MCV divided by RBC count (MCV/RBC). Can help distinguish between thalassemia and iron deficiency anemia. Mentzer index <13 suggests thalassemia and >13 suggests iron deficiency anemia.

KEY FACT

Patients with Fanconi anemia can be identified on physical examination by café au lait spots, short stature, and radial/thumb hypoplasia/aplasia.

NONHEMOLYTIC, NORMOCYTIC ANEMIAS

Aplastic Anemia Failure of blood cell production (pancytopenia) caused by destruction of bone marrow cells. It may be hereditary, as in Fanconi anemia (genetic analysis will show chromosomal breaks); may have an autoimmune or viral etiology (HIV, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], hepatitis); or may result from exposure to toxins (cleaning solvents, insecticides, benzene), radiation, or drugs (sulfa, chloramphenicol, propylthiouracil, carbamazepine, alcohol, methimazole, chemotherapy).

Q

A 30-year-old man from Greece comes to the physician’s office, complaining of chronic fatigue. He has no significant past medical history and is on no medications. A CBC shows Hb of 10.4 and MCV of 71. The physician starts him on oral iron supplements and sees him back in 4 weeks with no change in the CBC. What is the most likely diagnosis?

History/PE Patients are pancytopenic, with symptoms resulting from a lack of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets: pallor, fatigue, weakness, a tendency to infection, petechiae, bruising, and bleeding.

Diagnosis Diagnosed by clinical presentation and CBC Most accurate test: Bone marrow biopsy revealing hypocellularity and space occupied by

fat

Treatment Supportive therapy: Blood transfusion for anemia, antibiotics for infection, platelets for

bleeding

Consideration of allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in young patients with a matched donor. Some severe cases—patients without a stem cell donor or patients not suitable for BMT (>50 years of age)—call for immunosuppression with cyclosporine, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and eltrombopag to prevent autoimmune marrow destruction. Tacrolimus is an alternative to cyclosporine. Infections should be treated

aggressively.
======================================
KEY FACT

Diamond-Blackfan syndrome presents with pure red cell aplasia and congenital anomalies, such as triphalangeal thumbs and cleft lip.

HEMOLYTIC, NORMOCYTIC ANEMIAS

Occurs when bone marrow production is unable to compensate for ↑ destruction of circulating blood cells. Etiologies can be due to extrinsic and intrinsic hemolytic anemias as follows:

Extrinsic hemolytic anemias: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), microangiopathic

hemolytic anemia (TTP, HUS, DIC), macroangiopathic hemolytic anemia (prosthetic heart valves, aortic stenosis), hemolytic anemia due to infection (eg, malaria, Babesia) Intrinsic hemolytic anemias: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hereditary spherocytosis (see Fig. 2.7-11), sickle cell anemia.

FIGURE 2.7-11. Spherocytes. These RBCs (arrows) lack areas of central pallor. Spherocytes are seen in autoimmune hemolysis and in hereditary spherocytosis. (Reproduced with permission from Bun HF, Aster JC. Pathophysiology of Blood Disorders. New York, NY: McGraw Hill; 2011.)

History/PE Present with pallor, fatigue, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Jaundice often present too. Hepatosplenomegaly, pigmented gallstones (pigment caused

by ↑ indirect bilirubin), and leg ulcers (poor blood flow) may be noted.

MNEMONIC

Other: malaria, hypersplenism Mechanical hemolysis Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Autoimmune anemia Sickle cell disease Spherocytosis GLUCOSE 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency

The most likely diagnosis is β-thalassemia minor. The physician should recognize that this patient has a microcytic anemia that did not respond to iron supplements (probably has normal iron studies) and is from the Mediterranean.

Diagnosis Lab tests: CBC, reticulocytes, electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), haptoglobin,

urinary urobilinogen

Folate deficiency (folate is used from increased cell production) and hyperkalemia (↑ cell breakdown) may be seen. Urine is dark with hemoglobinuria, and there is ↑ excretion of urinary and fecal urobilinogen. A slight ↑ MCV (macrocytosis) is caused by large reticulocytes.

Blood films: Hypochromic microcytic anemia (thalassemia), sickle cells (sickle cell

anemia), schistocytes (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), abnormal cells (hematologic malignancy), spherocytes (hereditary spherocytosis or AIHA), Heinz bodies (seen with supravital staining), bite cells (G6PD deficiency). Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test to identify AIHA.

Treatment Varies with the cause of hemolytic anemia (see later) but often includes corticosteroids to address immunologic causes and iron supplementation to replace losses. Splenectomy or transfusions are helpful in severe cases.
======================================
G6PD DEFICIENCY

An X-linked recessive defect in G6PD, causing the inability to generate glutathione reductase, leaving RBCs susceptible to hemolytic anemia following oxidant stress.

History/PE: Patients are often males of Mediterranean or African descent who present with sudden anemia, episodic dark urine, and jaundice and who have a normal-sized spleen with an infection or use drugs that induce oxidative damage to RBCs. Common triggers include infections (most common), fava beans, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, dapsone, sulfa drugs (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX]), and antimalarials (quinines).

KEY FACT

A classic presentation of G6PD deficiency is a Black male patient presenting with fatigue,

A

dark urine, and shortness of breath (SOB) after taking TMP-SMX for a cold.

Diagnosis:

Best initial test: CBC with smear showing features of hemolysis with bite cells and Heinz bodies

Most accurate test: G6PD level 1 to 2 months after an episode (often normal during acute episode since G6PD-deficient RBCs are hemolyzed first)

Treatment: There is no reversal to the hemolysis. Avoiding triggers is the mainstay of treatment.

HEMOGLOBINURIA factor) and CD59 RBC surfaces protect

PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA

CD55 (complement decay-accelerating factor) and CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) proteins normally found on the RBC surfaces protect them from complement-mediated hemolysis. PNH is a deficiency in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor molecules that inhibit CD55/CD59 attachment or binding to RBCs, resulting in complement-mediated hemolysis and thrombosis. History/PE: PNH can manifest as iron deficiency anemia, episodic dark urine, venous

thrombosis (most commonly mesenteric and hepatic vein thrombosis), pancytopenia, and abdominal pain.

Diagnosis: Most accurate diagnostic test is CD55/CD59 absence via flow cytometry. Treatment: Prednisone is the best initial therapy. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is

curative. Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, can be used for hemolysis and thrombosis. Vaccination for Neisseria meningitidis needs to be administered for patients receiving eculizumab.
======================================
HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS

Autosomal dominant defect or deficiency in spectrin or ankyrin, an RBC membrane protein, resulting in a loss of RBC membrane surface area and characteristic biconcave disc. RBCs are forced to take spherical shapes and are trapped and destroyed by the spleen.

History/PE: Clinically presents as an extravascular hemolytic anemia with splenomegaly and jaundice. Acute cholecystitis from pigmented gallstones is a common complication.

Diagnosis:

Best initial test: CBC with a normal to low MCV, ↑ MCHC, and ⊖ Coombs test. A blood smear shows spherocytes (see Fig. 2.7-10).

Most accurate test: Eosin-5 maleimide flow cytometry (replaced osmotic fragility test) and acidified glycerol lysis test.

Treatment: Manage with a splenectomy (stops hemolysis, but spherocytes will remain) and chronic folic acid replacement (assists in RBC production). Patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) have a characteristically increased MCHC and RDW.

KEY FACT

Patients who had a splenectomy for any reason are at an increased lifelong risk for sepsis (for up to 30 years) from encapsulated bacteria and thus require pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus vaccinations before the operation.

AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

Autoantibodies against RBC membrane destroy blood cells, causing extravascular hemolysis. Two types:

Warm: IgG, associated with SLE, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphoma, penicillin, rifampin, phenytoin, and α-methyldopa

and a-methyldopa Mycoplasma pneumonia, anemia (see Fig®2:7-12). AIHA the most effective test

Cold: IgM, associated with Mycoplasma pneumonia, EBV, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia

History/PE: Presents as a hemolytic anemia Diagnosis: Direct Coombs test (see Fig. 2.7-12). AIHA is also associated with

spherocytes. Cold agglutinin is the most effective test in cold AIHA.

Treatment: If AIHA is mild, no treatment is necessary. Warm AIHA is treated with steroids; recurrent episodes respond to splenectomy. Severe, nonresponsive hemolysis is controlled with IVIG. Severe cold AIHA is managed by avoiding exposure to cold (keeping patient warm) ± rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody).

KEY FACT

Both AIHA and hereditary spherocytosis can present with spherocytes and positive osmotic fragility tests, but only AIHA will have a ⊕ direct Coombs’s test.
======================================
MEGALOBLASTIC, MACROCYTIC ANEMIA

Impaired DNA synthesis (due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, medications) → delayed maturation of nucleus of precursor cells in bone marrow relative to maturation of cytoplasm. Vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia, malabsorption (eg, Crohn disease), pancreatic insufficiency, gastrectomy, insufficient intake (eg, veganism), Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm), or drugs (eg, proton pump inhibitors [PPIs], antacids, metformin). Folate deficiency caused by malnutrition (eg, chronic alcohol overuse), malabsorption, drugs (eg, methotrexate, trimethoprim, phenytoin), ↑ requirement (eg, hemolytic anemia, pregnancy). Drugs that interfere with DNA synthesis include chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine).

History/PE

Megaloblastic anemia presents with fatigue, pallor, glossitis, cheilosis, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and headache.

Vitamin B12 deficiency causes neurologic symptoms: reversible dementia and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (vitamin B12 is required in fatty acid pathways and myelin synthesis) involving the spinocerebellar tract, lateral corticospinal tract (causing motor and upper motor neuron [UMN] signs), and dorsal column (causing sensory and lower motor neuron [LMN] signs).

Folate deficiency does not cause neurologic symptoms. Folate supplementation in vitamin B12 deficiency can correct the anemia, but it worsens neurologic symptoms.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC (↓ Hb, ↑ MCV) with peripheral blood smear showing RBC

macrocytosis and hypersegmented (six or more lobes) neutrophils (see Fig. 2.7-13). Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency are identical hematologically and on blood smear.

A Schilling test measures the absorption of cobalamin via ingestion of radiolabeled cobalamin with and without intrinsic factor. This test is rarely performed. Radiolabeled vitamin B12 in urine: Dietary vitamin B12 deficiency. No radiolabeled vitamin B12 in urine: Pernicious anemia, bacterial overgrowth, or pancreatic enzyme deficiency. The hypothesis undergoes testing with the addition of intrinsic factor, antibiotics, or pancreatic enzymes to radiolabeled B12.
======================================
KEY FACT

Vitamin B12 deficiency can be caused by infection by a tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum. Folate deficiency can occur secondary to chronic phenytoin use, causing malabsorption.

KEY FACT

Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord seen in vitamin B12 deficiency presents as pe-ripheral neuropathy, vibration and proprioception dysfunction, dementia, and spasticity.

KEY FACT

Only megaloblastic anemia (eg, due to vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency) is associated with hypersegmented neutrophils (not nonmegaloblastic anemia, eg, due to chronic alcohol overuse, liver disease).

KEY FACT

Pernicious anemia increases the risk for gastric cancer and is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in people of European descent.

Intramuscular hydroxocobalamin B,, supplementation caused by dysfunction

Treatment Addressing underlying cause. Intramuscular hydroxocobalamin (if vitamin B12 deficiency due to malabsorption), oral vitamin B12 supplementation (if due to dietary causes).

PORPHYRIAS

Porphyrias are metabolic disorders caused by dysfunction in the enzymatic activity of heme synthesis, which results in the abnormal accumulation of heme precursors.

History/PE History reveals acute attacks. The physical examination can reveal signs specific to an enzymatic deficiency such as neurovisceral manifestations (abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy) and cutaneous photosensitivity (blistering). See Table 2.7-5.

Diagnosis For suspected acute intermittent porphyria, measurement of porphobilinogen (PBG) in the

urine at the time of the attack (sensitive and specific) can be diagnostic.

For suspected blistering cutaneous porphyria, measurement of plasma or urine porphyrins can help confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment Supportive treatment (pain, nausea) Avoidance of triggering factors such as alcohol, smoking, OCPs Specific treatments in Table 2.7-12

======================================
POLYCYTHEMIAS

Erythrocytosis (an abnormal elevation of Hct) may be either absolute (↑ RBC production) or relative (↓ plasma volume and hemoconcentration). Absolute polycythemia causes are primary (polycythemia rubra vera) or secondary (caused by hypoxia) or inappropriately ↑ EPO secretion (EPO-producing tumors).

History/PE Polycythemias are characterized by ↑ Hct, ↑ blood viscosity, ↓ tissue blood flow and

by t Hct, t blood with hypoxia (lung cyanotic congenital carcinoma, hepatocellular neoplasm that results

oxygenation, and ↑ cardiac work.

Absolute erythrocytosis is associated with hypoxia (lung disease, heavy smoking, high altitudes, obstructive sleep apnea, cyanotic congenital heart disease, or poor intrauterine environment); neoplasia (renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma); or polycythemia vera (PCV).

A PCV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that results from clonal proliferation of a pluripotent marrow stem cell caused by a mutation in the JAK2, which regulates marrow production. There is excess proliferation of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets → hyperviscosity and thrombosis, but RBCs are most significantly affected. RBCs proliferate at an exceedingly high rate despite a low level of EPO.

Presentation: Hyperviscosity syndrome. Easy bleeding/bruising from engorged blood vessels, fatigue, hypertension, thrombosis (arterial and venous), visual disturbance, neurologic deficits, headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, pruritus after a warm bath, congestive heart failure (CHF), facial plethora, and splenomegaly.

Commonly affects older individuals (>60 years of age). Can convert to acute myeloid leukemia in a small proportion of patients. Relative erythrocytosis is associated with hypovolemia and dehydration: diuresis,

gastroenteritis, alcohol, burns.

KEY FACT

Hemoglobinuria in a hemolytic transfusion reaction may lead to acute tubular necrosis and subsequent renal failure.

KEY FACT

Mutations in the JAK2 gene lead to PCV and account for 30% to 50% of the cases of two other myeloproliferative disorders: Essential thrombocytopenia and myelofigrosis.

Diagnosis PCV: Best initial test is a CBC showing elevated RBCs/WBCs/platelets (↑ reticulocyte, ↑ Hb, ↑ Hct, ↑ packed cell volume) with an arterial blood gas (ABG) and EPO level. ↓ EPO, normal O2, and Hct >60% (key finding) suggest packed cell volume. Most accurate test is the JAK2 mutation (present in 95% of patients).

Relative erythrocytosis also has an ↑ Hct and splenomegaly, but EPO is normal or increased, and O2 is often low compared to packed cell volume.
======================================
KEY FACT

PCV has low EPO and normal O2 levels. Relative erythrocytosis has normal or increased EPO with low O2 levels.

KEY FACT

of stem cell disorders marrow: <20% blasts stem from de novo Phlebotomy and aspirin

Myelodysplastic syndromes consist of stem cell disorders due to ineffective hematopoiesis → ↑ number of blasts in the bone marrow: <20% blasts comparted to AML with >20% blasts. Myelodysplastic syndromes stem from de novo mutations or from exposures (chemotherapy, radiation).

Treatment PCV: Target is hematocrit <45%. Phlebotomy and aspirin provide symptom relief and prevent thrombosis. Hydroxyurea reduces cell counts. Elevated uric acid levels are common due to increased cell turnover. This can lead to gout and kidney stones. Hydroxyurea-resistant disease is treated with ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor).

Relative erythrocytosis: Treatment should address the underlying cause and treat symptoms with phlebotomy.

Q

A 49-year-old man comes into the clinic complaining of “tiredness” over the last several months. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol overuse. A CBC reveals a low Hb and an MCV of 115 Fl. What is the most likely cause of his anemia?

BLOOD TRANSFUSION REACTIONS

Transfusions are generally safe but may result in adverse reactions (see Table 2.7-13). Febrile nonhemolytic and allergic reactions are the most common, occurring in 3% to 4% of all transfusions.

======================================
KEY FACT

Premedication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine is sometimes used to prevent minor transfusion reactions.

The patient has megaloblastic anemia caused by either a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. His history of alcohol dependence strongly suggests folate deficiency, as that is the most common cause of megaloblastic anemia in people with a history of acute/chronic alcohol overuse.

WHITE BLOOD CELL DISORDERS

NEUTROPENIA

An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1500 cells/mm3, where ANC = (WBC count) × (%

bands + % segmented neutrophils). Neutropenia may be caused by a combination of ↓ production, migration away from the vascular space, and ↑ destruction or utilization. It may be acquired or intrinsic. The most common causes of neutropenia in adults are infections and drugs. Other common causes include diseases that infiltrate the bone marrow such as leukemias or lymphomas, aplastic anemias, or vitamin B12/folate deficiencies.

Felty syndrome: Neutropenia along with splenomegaly and rheumatoid arthritis

History/PE Patients are at ↑ risk for infection. Severe infections are typical when <500 cells/mm3. Acute neutropenia: Associated with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, E coli,

Proteus, and Klebsiella sepsis.

Chronic and autoimmune neutropenia: Presents with recurrent sinusitis, stomatitis,

gingivitis, and perirectal infections rather than sepsis. Some chronic neutropenias are accompanied by splenomegaly (Felty syndrome, Gaucher disease, sarcoidosis). The physician should look for drug or toxin exposure, infection, autoimmunity, or

neoplastic disease.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC with a peripheral blood smear. Neutropenia is followed up with

ANC and thrombocytopenia or anemia with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

Serum immunologic evaluation, antinuclear antibody (ANA) levels, and a workup for collagen vascular disease may be merited.

antinuclear antibody merited. patients cannot drugs-implicated in of neutropenia,

Treatment Infection management: Neutropenic patients cannot mount an effective inflammatory

response.

It is important to discontinue drugs implicated in neutropenia.

Neutropenic fever: In the context of neutropenia, fever is a medical emergency that calls for immediate treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cefepime that provide Pseudomonas coverage. Suspected fungal infections also call for appropriate treatment.

Hematopoietic stem cell factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (filgrastim) can be used to shorten the duration of neutropenia. Rarely, IVIG and allogeneic BMT may be used.

Neutropenic Fever Defined as a single oral temperature of ≥38.3°C (≥101°F) in a neutropenic patient or a temperature of ≥38°C (≥100.4°F) for ≥1 hour in a neutropenic patient (ie, an ANC <500 cells/mm3).
======================================
KEY FACT

The ANC (cells/mm3) can be obtained by multiplying the total WBCs found on CBC by percentage of polymorphonuclear cells.

History/PE Common in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (neutropenic nadir 7–10 days

postchemotherapy). Signs of infection may be minimal or absent. Thorough physical examination but no rectal examination in light of the bleeding and infection risk.

Diagnosis CBC with differential, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and transaminases. Testing of blood, urine, lesion, sputum, and stool cultures. The physician should also consider testing for viruses, fungi, and mycobacteria.

X-ray of the chest (CXR) for patients with respiratory symptoms; a CT scan to evaluate for abscesses or other occult infection.

Treatment Empiric antibiotic therapy immediately with antipseudomonal agent (cefepime, piperacillin- tazobactam) and vancomycin for methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) coverage in patients with indwelling catheters, pneumonia, or cutaneous abscess. Routine use of colony- stimulating factors is not indicated. If fevers persist after 72 hours despite antibiotic therapy, the physician should start antifungal treatment (eg, amphotericin B or caspofungin).

LYMPHOPENIA AND EOSENOPENIA

An absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <1500/mm3, where ALC (cells/microL) = WBC (cells/microL) × percent lymphocytes ÷ 100. The most common causes of lymphopenia include viral infections such as HIV, congenital disorders like DiGeorge syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), sepsis, immunosuppressive medications (glucocorticoids), SLE, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Table 2.7-14 presents lymphopenia versus eosinopenia.

Corticosteroids also impair neutrophil adhesion molecules, limiting migration out of the vasculature to sites of inflammation. In contrast, corticosteroids sequester eosinophils in lymph nodes and cause apoptosis of lymphocytes.

History/PE Patients are at ↑ risk for recurrent infections (especially opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections in HIV) and autoimmune disorders.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC with a peripheral blood smear. Neutropenia is followed up with ANC and thrombocytopenia or anemia with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

Treatment Asymptomatic lymphopenia is usually not treated, but is monitored. HIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy. Prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic

infections in HIV are the standard of care.

In case of immunodeficiency syndromes, immunoglobulin replacement may be considered.
======================================
EOSINOPHILIA

An absolute eosinophil count ≥500/mm3. Eosinophilia as a primary disorder is rare. The most common cause in the developed world is allergy, whereas in the developing world, it is parasitic infection. Table 2.7-15 summarizes the different etiologies of hypereosinophilia.

Commonly observed in patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis. The chronic inflammation and mucoid impaction can result in lung damage, particularly bronchiectasis and fibrosis.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA): A type of vasculitis also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, which consists of chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP): Idiopathic disorder caused by high accumulation of eosinophils in the interstitium of the lungs

History/PE Procurement of travel, medication, and diet history. Inquiry into predisposing conditions, including atopy, asthma, sinus symptoms, cystic

fibrosis, peripheral neuropathy, and lymphoma/leukemia.

Examination directed toward cause. Patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) may present with fever, anemia, and prominent cardiac findings (emboli from mural thrombi, abnormal ECGs, congestive heart failure [CHF], murmurs).

Eosinophils able to infiltrate and affect other organs as well (cutaneous, respiratory, GI, and nervous systems).

The absolute eosinophil count does not accurately predict organ damage.

Diagnosis CBC with differential. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing eosinophilia is suggestive of a drug reaction or infection with coccidioidomycosis or a helminth.

Hematuria with eosinophilia is a possible sign of schistosomiasis. ABPA: Serum IgE against A fumigatus or elevated total serum IgE concentration. EGPA: Eosinophilia (≥1500 cells/microL), asthma, rhinosinusitis, and evidence on

histopathology of eosinophilic infiltration with or without vasculitis.

CEP: Bronchoalveolar lavage showing eosinophilia with CT chest imaging findings of opacities.

======================================
Q

A 35-year-old man is airlifted to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. He requires multiple transfusions, which stabilize his blood pressure (BP) and Hb. The following morning, he is transferred to his hospital room, where he begins to complain of numbness in his fingers. A prolonged QT interval is noted on an ECG. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Treatment Immediate treatment: New-onset cardiac findings, eosinophilia >100,000/mm3, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) must be spotted early and should be treated with steroids and discontinuation of offending agents.

Nonemergency treatment: Several steroid-sparing agents can be considered.

Mepolizumab: A monoclonal antibody directed against IL-5, a growth factor needed for the maturation of eosinophils and their activation

Benralizumab: Monoclonal anti-IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5R) Hydroxyurea: Works by suppressing eosinophilopoiesis Other treatments: Imatinib (features of myeloid disease), interferon alpha, alemtuzumab

(anti-CD52 antibody), and JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib and ruxolitinib)

Treatment-specific indications:

ABPA: Steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Antifungal therapy with itraconazole or voriconazole can be considered in addition to steroids during an acute exacerbation.

Omalizumab: Humanized monoclonal antibody can be considered in the setting of poorly

controlled asthma. Mepolizumab and benralizumab can be considered in severe asthma and hypereosinophilia.

EGPA: Steroids are the mainstay of treatment. During remission, steroid-sparing agents with azathioprine or methotrexate are considered. Mepolizumab and benralizumab can be considered.

CEP: Steroids are the mainstay of treatment.

KEY FACT

A characteristic sign for AML subtype M3 (APL) is the Auer rod seen in the WBC cytoplasm (see Fig. 2.7-14), although Auer rods can be seen in other AML subtypes.

======================================
LEUKEMIAS

Malignant proliferations of hematopoietic cells, categorized by the type of cell involved and their level of differentiation

Acute Leukemias Acute myelogenous and lymphocytic leukemias are clonal disorders of early hematopoietic stem cells (blasts), resulting in unregulated growth and differentiation of WBCs in bone marrow. As the bone marrow becomes replaced by leukemia cells, patients present with features of pancytopenia: anemia (↓ RBCs), infection (↓ mature WBCs), and hemorrhage (↓ platelets).

Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are two subtypes that most commonly affect children and adults, respectively.

This patient presents with symptoms of hypocalcemia following multiple blood transfusions. Blood products often contain citrate, which binds to serum calcium, leading to hypocalcemia, which can cause prolonged QT intervals.

History/PE Rapid onset and progression. Patients present with signs and symptoms of anemia (pallor,

A

fatigue), thrombocytopenia (petechiae, purpura, bleeding), infections (ineffective and immature WBCs), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, most commonly seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]). Medullary expansion into the periosteum may lead to bone pain (common in ALL).

Physical examination may show hepatosplenomegaly and swollen/bleeding gums from leukemic infiltration and ↓ platelets. Leukemic cells also infiltrate the skin and the central nervous system (CNS).

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC with smear showing blast cells. Most accurate test: Bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry to classify leukemia type. Marrow that is infiltrated with blast cells is consistent with leukemia. In AML, the leukemic cells are myeloblasts; in ALL, they are lymphoblasts. These cells can be distinguished by morphology (see Fig. 2.7-15), cytogenetics, and immunophenotyping (see Table 2.7-16).

FIGURE 2.7-15. AML and ALL on peripheral smear. (A) AML. Large, uniform myeloblasts with round or kidney-shaped nuclei and prominent nucleoli are characteristic. (B) ALL. Peripheral blood smear reveals numerous large, uniform lymphoblasts, which are large cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Some lymphoblasts have visible clefts in their nuclei.

======================================
TABLE 2.7-16. Myeloblasts vs Lymphoblasts

WBC count can be elevated, but the cells are dysfunctional, and patients may be neutropenic with a history of frequent infection. If the WBC count is very high (eg, >100,000/mm3), there is a risk for leukostasis (blasts occluding the microcirculation, leading to pulmonary edema, CNS symptoms, ischemic injury, and DIC).

symptoms, ischemic are treated with some patients, especially not respond appropriately combined with arsenic (hyperuricemia,

Treatment In general, ALL and AML cases are treated with chemotherapy. Bone marrow transplantation is considered in some patients, especially those with higher risk cytogenetics and those who do not respond appropriately to upfront chemotherapy.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with arsenic trioxide is highly effective in APL. To prevent tumor lysis syndrome (hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, renal

insufficiency, as blasts are destroyed by chemotherapy), patients should be well hydrated. If WBC counts are ↑, they may also be started on allopurinol or rasburicase (often used in the pediatric population) to decrease serum uric acid as renal protection. Rasburicase is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency.

Leukostasis syndrome may be treated with hydroxyurea ± leukapheresis to ↓ WBC count. Indicators of poor prognosis:

ALL: Age <1 year or >10 years; an ↑ in WBC count to >50,000/mm3; presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) (associated with B-cell cancer); CNS involvement at diagnosis

AML: Age >60 years; elevated LDH; poor-risk or complex karyotype

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia A malignant, clonal proliferation of mature but functionally incompetent lymphocytes that accumulate in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. All CLL cases involve well-differentiated B lymphocytes. Primarily affects older adults (median age 65 years); the male-to-female ratio is 2:1.

History/PE Often asymptomatic; patients present with fatigue, malaise, and infection. Common physical findings are lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.
======================================
Q

A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and lymphoma presents with nausea, vomiting, and fever of 2 days’ duration. She just completed her second cycle of high-dose chemotherapy. She has a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). Her CXR is unchanged, and her WBC count is 900/mm3 with 25% neutrophils. After urine and blood cultures have been sent, what is the next step in management?

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC with differential and smear showing mature lymphocytosis (B cells >500/mm3) and characteristic smudge cells (fragile leukemia cells crushed by the slide). See Figure 2.7-16.

smudge cells. The (arrows; fragile malignant characteristic. (Reproduced with shows

FIGURE 2.7-16. CLL with characteristic smudge cells. The numerous small, mature lymphocytes and smudge cells (arrows; fragile malignant lymphocytes are disrupted during blood smear preparation) are characteristic. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Peter McPhedran, Yale Department of Hematology.)

Most accurate test: Flow cytometry shows monoclonal B cells with CD5 and CD23 markers.

Granulocytopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are common as leukemic cells infiltrate bone marrow. Abnormal function by the leukemic cells leads to hypogammaglobulinemia.

Bone marrow biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis but may provide prognostic information.

KEY FACT

The presence of smudge cells may indicate CLL. Smudge cells result from the coverslip crushing the fragile leukemia cells.

Treatment CLL often does not require treatment due to its indolent natural history. Disease

progression should be monitored every 3 to 6 months.

Initial preferred agents are ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor), rituximab (anti-CD20 mAb therapy), venetoclax (anti-BCL2 therapy)

Treatment, however, is palliative and is often withheld until patients are symptomatic: recurrent infection, severe lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia (poorest prognosis).

Although CLL has a low likelihood of long-term cure, extended disease-free intervals may be achieved with adequate treatment of symptoms. The clinical stage correlates with expected survival.
======================================
CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA

Clonal expansion of myeloid progenitor cells, leading to leukocytosis with excess granulocytes and basophils and sometimes ↑ erythrocytes and platelets as well. To truly be CML, the BCR-ABL translocation must be present. In >95% of patients, this is reflected on conventional cytogenetic analysis by the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22). CML primarily affects middle-aged patients (median age 50 years).

The physician should admit the patient and begin IV antibiotics with an antipseudomonal β-lactam (eg, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem). Febrile, neutropenic patients who are on high-dose chemotherapy, have a hematologic malignancy, or have been neutropenic for >14 days should be admitted for empiric IV antibiotics.

History/PE Many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Typical signs and symptoms are those of

at diagnosis. Typical with left upper quadrant loss, anorexia, fever, of treatment go through this phase typically lasts rare:

anemia.

Patients can have splenomegaly with left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain and early satiety. Constitutional symptoms of weight loss, anorexia, fever, and chills may also be seen.

Patients with CML in the absense of treatment go through three disease phases:

Chronic: Without treatment, this phase typically lasts 3.5 to 5 years. Infection and bleeding complications are rare.

Accelerated: This phase embodies a transition toward blast crisis, with an ↑ in peripheral and bone marrow blast counts. It should be suspected when the differential shows an abrupt ↑ in basophils and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/mm3).

KEY FACT

The presence of smudge cells may indicate CLL. Smudge cells result from the coverslip crushing the fragile leukemia cells.

Blast crisis: A large percentage of untreated CML patients will eventually reach this phase. It resembles acute leukemia; survival is 3 to 6 months.

KEY FACT

The likely diagnosis of leukemia is based on age at presentation: ALL: <13 years (but can present in any age group) AML: 13 to 40 years (but can present in any age group) CML: 40 to 60 years CLL: >60 years
======================================
A

Diagnosis Most accurate test: Philadelphia chromosome via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showing the t(9;22) translocation, although some cases lack the translocation.

CBC often shows a very high WBC count—often >100,000/mm3 at diagnosis, sometimes reaching >500,000/mm3. The differential shows granulocytes (predominantly neutrophils) in all stages of maturation. Rarely, the WBC count will be so elevated as to cause a hyperviscosity syndrome.

CML can be confused clinically with a leukemoid reaction (acute inflammatory response to infection with ↑ neutrophils and a left shift). Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score is low in CML and other hematologic malignancies, and LAP is high in leukemoid reactions. See Table 2.7-17.

TABLE 2.7-17. Leukemoid Reaction vs CML 19

LEUKEMOID REACTION CML Leucocyte count 50,000/mm? Often >100,000/mm+?)

More mature (meta- myelocytes > myelocytes) Not present

KEY FACT

Lymphocytosis is a common lab finding of CLL (↑ B cells) vs CML, which shows granulocytosis (↑ granulocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils).

Q 1

A 40-year-old woman sees a physician for a 6-month history of weight loss, fevers, and abdominal discomfort. Her WBC count is 56,000/mm3. The physician orders a leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) to distinguish between a leukemoid reaction and a hematologic malignancy. What is the expected result in a leukemoid reaction?

Q 2

A 41-year-old man is diagnosed with AML. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

analysis reveals that he has APL, M3 subtype (FAB classification). What is the preferred therapy for this subtype of AML?

Treatment Chronic: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, imatinib). Young patients may be candidates for

allogeneic stem cell transplantation if a matched sibling donor is available.

Blast crisis: Same as that for acute leukemia, or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, dasatinib, nilotinib) plus hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or a clinical trial.

Hairy Cell Leukemia A malignant disorder of well-differentiated B lymphocytes. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare disease that accounts for 2% of adult leukemia cases and most commonly affects older males (median age 50–55 years).
======================================
KEY FACT

Imatinib is a selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, the product of the t(9;22) translocation, or Philadelphia chromosome.

bone marrow fatigue, petechiae, bruising, Mycobacterium Presentation is similar to

History/PE Typically presents with pancytopenia, bone marrow infiltration, and splenomegaly. Patients complain of weakness, fatigue, petechiae, bruising, infection (especially with atypical mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare), abdominal pain, early satiety, and weight loss. Presentation is similar to that of CLL except that patients rarely have lymphadenopathy.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC with smear showing pathognomonic “hairy cells” (mononuclear

cells with many cytoplasmic projections; see Fig. 2.7-17) that stain with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Leukopenia can sometimes be seen as well.

FIGURE 2.7-17. Hairy cell leukemia. Note the hairlike cytoplasmic projections from neoplastic lymphocytes. Villous lymphoma can also have this appearance. (Reproduced with permission from Dr. Peter McPhedran, Yale Department of Hematology.)

Most accurate test: Flow cytometry identifying the “hairy cells”

Treatment Best initial treatment: Cladribine.

Alternative treatment options: Pentostatin, rituximab, and interferon (IFN)-α. Median survival without treatment is 5 years. If left untreated, most patients will develop

progressive pancytopenia and splenomegaly, eventually requiring therapy.

1 A

The LAP score would be ↑ . Hematologic malignancies, in contrast, have ↓ LAP score.

2 A

APL has a favorable prognosis, because it is responsive to ATRA therapy. This AML subtype is also associated with an ↑ incidence of DIC and a chromosomal translocation involving chromosomes 15 and 17.

LYMPHOMAS

Malignant transformations of lymphoid cells residing primarily in lymphoid tissues, especially the lymph nodes. Classically organized into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). See Table 2.7-18.

Lymphoma HODGKIN LYMPHOMA Single group of localized and rarely involves

First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 2018. New York, NY: McGraw- Hill; 2018.

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma NHL represents a diverse group of mature B- and T-cell neoplasms. Most NHLs (almost 85%) are of B-cell origin. NHL is the most common hematopoietic neoplasm and is five times more common than HL.

History/PE The median patient age is >50 years, but NHL may also be found in children, who tend to have more aggressive, higher-grade disease. Patient presentation varies with disease (see Table 2.7-19), but often includes painless peripheral lymphadenopathy, “B” symptoms (fevers, night sweats, weight loss), and masses on examination.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Excisional lymph node biopsy A CSF exam should be done in patients with HIV, neurologic symptoms, or primary CNS

lymphoma.

Treatment Radiation and/or chemotherapy can be used as a therapy. Low-grade indolent NHL treatment is generally palliative. High-grade aggressive NHL treatment is aggressive chemotherapy with a curative

approach. A common regimen is rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP).

The treatment of high-grade NHL may be complicated by tumor lysis syndrome, in which rapid cell death releases intracellular contents and leads to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia.

Hodgkin Lymphoma A predominantly B-cell malignancy associated with EBV. HL has a bimodal age distribution: 30 years of age (primarily the nodular sclerosing type) and 60 years of age (mainly the lymphocyte-depleted type). It has a male predominance in childhood.

History/PE HL commonly presents above the diaphragm (classically as cervical adenopathy; see Fig.

2.7-18A). Infradiaphragmatic involvement suggests disseminated disease.

======================================
Patients can have systemic B symptoms, pruritus, and hepatosplenomegaly. Pel-Ebstein fevers (1–2 weeks of high fever alternating with 1–2 afebrile weeks) and alcohol-induced pain at nodal sites are rare signs specific for HL.

KEY FACT

On physical examination, lymph nodes suspicious for malignancy are generally described as firm, fixed, nontender, circumscribed, rubbery, and >1 cm in diameter. Benign nodes (usually from infection) are generally described as bilateral, <1 cm, mobile, and nontender (viral) or tender (bacterial).

Diagnosis Best initial step: Excisional lymph node biopsy shows the classic Reed-Sternberg cells

(giant abnormal B cells with bilobar nuclei and huge, eosinophilic nucleoli, which create an “owl’s-eye” appearance; see Fig. 2.7-18B).

Staging is based on the number of lymph node groups involved, the presence of B

symptoms, and whether the disease involves lymph nodes (both sides of the diaphragm) and extranodal sites (eg, bone marrow).

KEY FACT

Chemotherapy and radiation can lead to secondary neoplasms such as AML, NHL, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer. Preventive measures such as mammography are warranted.

Treatment Treatment is stage dependent, involving chemotherapy and/or radiation (in early stage disease). A common chemotherapy regimen is Adriamycin (doxorubicin), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD).

Radiation increases the risk for premature coronary artery disease, solid tumors (eg, breast, lung, thyroid), and hypothyroidism.

Five-year survival rates are 90% for stage I and II disease (nodal disease limited to one side of the diaphragm), 84% for stage III, and 65% for stage IV. Lymphocyte-predominant HL has the best prognosis.

PLASMA CELL DISORDERS

plasma cells with excessive IgA: or IgG) and/or myeloma (MM) inelude radiation exposure

MULTIPLE MYELOMA

Clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells with excessive production of monoclonal immunoglobulins (typically ineffective IgA or IgG) and/or immunoglobulin fragments (kappa/lambda light chains). Multiple myeloma (MM) primarily affects older adults, peaking in the seventh decade. Risk factors include radiation exposure and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).
======================================
KEY FACT

Chemotherapy often induces nausea in cancer patients and should be managed with ondansetron, a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonist.

MNEMONIC

Clinical features of multiple myeloma— CRAB Cooselycemia Renal involvement/Recurrent infections Anemia/Amyloidosis Bone lytic lesions/Back pain

History/PE Patients present with bone pain or with a pathologic fracture (MM cells infiltrate bone

marrow, where they activate osteoclasts, creating lytic lesions, weak bones, and hypercalcemia).

Patients are prone to infection (IgG and IgA produced by myeloma cells are monoclonal, thus making them ineffective) and have elevated monoclonal (M) proteins in serum and/or urine.

KEY FACT

Similar to MM, MGUS is a monoclonal expansion of plasma cells that is asymptomatic and may eventually lead to multiple myeloma (1%-2% per year). No “CRAB” findings.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Serum protein electrophoresis showing IgG or IgA monoclonal spikes

(see Fig. 2.7-19), and/or serum free light chains.

Albumin oy 02 B Y Serum protein electrophoretic Note that M protein spike permission from’ USMLE-Rx.com.) biopsy shows >10% formation, whereas

FIGURE 2.7-19. Multiple myeloma. Serum protein electrophoretic tracing showing M protein spike IgG/A (diagnostic of MM). Note that M protein spike IgM indicates Waldenström macroglobulinemia. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Most accurate test: Bone marrow biopsy shows >10% monoclonal CD138+ plasma cells. CBC with smear may show rouleaux formation, whereas urine protein electrophoresis may

show Bence Jones protein (paraprotein). Gamma gap (total serum protein – serum albumin) is often elevated.

M protein alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of MM, as MGUS, CLL, lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and amyloidosis can also ↑ M protein.

Patients should also be evaluated for anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Bone lesions are also seen with imaging such as a skeletal survey (see Fig. 2.7-20).

marrow transplant. Common chemotherapeutic agents are cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, daratumumab (anti-CD138 mAb), dexamethasone, and lenalidomide.

Patients who are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation can be treated with daratumumab, lenalidmoide, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and/or bortexomib.

WALDENSTRöM MACROGLOBULINEMIA

A clonal disorder of B cells that leads to malignant monoclonal gammopathy. ↑ levels of IgM result in hyperviscosity syndrome, coagulation abnormalities, cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease (leading to AIHA), and amyloidosis. Tissue is infiltrated by IgM and neoplastic plasma cells. A chronic, indolent disease of older adults.

KEY FACT

Cryoglobulinemia and cold agglutinins are different disorders caused by IgM antibodies. Cryoglobulinemia is most often seen in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and has systemic signs such

as joint pain and renal involvement. Cold agglutinins may cause finger or toe numbness and hemolytic anemia upon cold exposure and are seen with EBV, mycoplasmal infection, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

History/PE Presents with nonspecific symptoms: Lethargy, weight loss, and Raynaud phenomenon

from cryoglobulinemia. Organomegaly and organ dysfunction can be present.

Neurologic problems ranging from mental status changes to sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy and blurry vision (engorged blood vessels can be noted on eye exam) are also seen.

As with MM, MGUS is a precursor to disease.

Diagnosis Most accurate test: Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate. Marrow shows abnormal plasma cells, classically with Dutcher bodies (periodic acid–Schiff [PAS]⊕ IgM deposits around the nucleus). Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation are also used. Nonspecific findings include ↑ erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), uric acid, LDH, and

alkaline phosphatase.

Treatment Rituximab and chemotherapy for patients with symptomatic disease. Plasmapheresis can remove excess immunoglobulin for patients who present with signs or symptoms of hyperviscosity.

History/PE Clinical presentation depends on the type, amount, and tissue distribution of amyloid. In the most common forms of systemic amyloidosis, primary (AL) and secondary (AA), the major sites of clinically important amyloid deposition are in the kidneys, heart, and liver.

In some disorders, amyloid deposition is limited to one organ (eg, cerebral amyloid angiopathy in Alzheimer disease).

Diagnosis Most accurate test: Tissue biopsy with Congo red staining showing apple-green birefringence under polarized light.

Treatment Primary amyloidosis is treated with chemotherapy and/or autologous stem cell transplant.

Chemotherapy agents are similar to those used in MM.

Secondary amyloidosis is treated by addressing the underlying condition.

She has a history of multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs) and was recently hospitalized for pyelonephritis. Urinalysis (UA) reveals pyuria and bacteriuria. Ultrasound performed in the emergency department shows what appears to be a perinephric abscess. What is the next most appropriate step in management?

Q 2

An 80-year-old man is seen in clinic after an incidental finding of elevated IgG on a recent hospital admission for pneumonia. He has no signs of kidney damage, anemia, or bone lesions. The IgG level is 2100 mg/dL, and a subsequent bone marrow biopsy shows 3% plasma cells. What is the next best step?

TRANSPLANT MEDICINE

Three types of tissue transplantation are increasingly used to treat diseases: Autologous: Transplantation from the patient to himself or herself Allogeneic: Transplantation from a donor to a genetically different patient Syngeneic: Transplantation between identical twins (from a donor to a genetically

identical patient)

With allogeneic donation, efforts are made to ABO- and HLA-match the donor and recipient. Despite matching and immunosuppression, however, transplants may be rejected. There are three types of solid organ rejection: hyperacute, acute, and chronic (see Table 2.7-21).

TABLE 2.7-21. Types of Solid Organ Transplant Rejection

HYPERACUTE VARIABLE Timing after transplant Within minutes (intraopera- tively) ACUTE Between 5 days and 3 months CHRONIC Months to years Pathogenesis Tissue findings Prevention Treatment Preformed antibodies Vascular thrombi; tissue ischemia Check ABO compatibility Cytotoxic agents Mixed T-cell and B-cell mediated response against mismatched HLA class | and class II antigens Laboratory evidence of tissue destruction such as T gamma- glutamy! transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, LDH, BUN, or creatinine Confirmation with sampling of transplanted tissue; initial treatment with corticosteroids. Additional immunosuppressive therapy can include antilym- phocyte antibodies (OKT3), tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) Chronic immune reaction causing fibrosis Gradual loss of organ function No treatment; biopsy to rule out treatable acute reaction

Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a complication specific to allogeneic BMT in which donated T cells attack host tissues, especially the skin, liver, and GI tract. It may be acute (<100 days posttransplant) or chronic (>100 days afterward).

Minor histocompatibility antigens are thought to be responsible for GVHD, which presents with skin changes, cholestatic liver dysfunction, obstructive lung disease, or GI problems.

Patients are treated with high-dose corticosteroids. Typical posttransplant immunosuppression regimens include prednisone; mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); FK506 (tacrolimus) to suppress immune-mediated rejection; and TMP- SMX, ganciclovir, and fluconazole to prevent subsequent infection in the immunosuppressed host.

A variant of GVHD is the graft-vs-leukemia effect, in which leukemia patients who are treated with an allogeneic bone marrow transplant have significantly lower relapse rates of leukemia than those treated with an autologous transplant. This difference is thought to be caused by a recognition of leukemia cells by the donor T cells.
======================================
1 A

Patients with multiple myeloma frequently have renal dysfunction secondary to urinary immunoglobulins (also known as Bence Jones protein) that have the ability to form casts, leading to cast nephropathy.

2 A

This patient has MGUS, as seen by the elevated IgG in the absence of other clinical abnormalities or symptoms. No treatment is required, but because MGUS can progress to MM, this patient should be seen regularly for signs of renal failure, anemia, or bone pain.

MULTISYSTEM HEMATOLOGY

HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS

Life-threatening state of severe immune system activation due to overactive macrophages and lymphocytes with phagocytosis of blood cells. This commonly occur in infants 0 to 18 months but can be seen in adults of all ages.

all ages. hepatosplenomegaly, neurologic dysfunction, cytopenias,

History/PE Presents with fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, neurologic disturbances (seizures, mental status changes, ataxia), multiorgan dysfunction, cytopenias, coagulopathies, and hemodynamic instability.

Diagnosis Clinical findings as mentioned: ↑ inflammatory markers (ferritin, Scd25, CXCL9)↑ Bone marrow aspirate demonstrating hemophagocytosis

Treatment Acutely ill: dexamethasone and etoposide. Supportive care (blood transfusion for anemia and thrombocytopenia), antibiotics for infection due to pancytopenia, immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (eg, dexamethasone and etoposide).

MASTOCYTOSIS

Rare disorder involving excessive release and accumulation of mastocytes in the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) or other tissues (systemic mastocytosis).

History/PE Physical examination demonstrating skin findings: diffuse red-brown cutaneous maculopapular lesions and splenomegaly.

Diagnosis Skin or bone marrow biopsy with KIT stain (mast cell specific) with ↑ mast cell

concentration, KIT mutation, serum tryptase >20.

Bone marrow biopsy can also show cytopenia due to crowding of the bone marrow by mastocytosis.

Treatment Aimed at preventing mast cell degranulation with antihistamines, cromolyn, and antileukotrienes.
======================================
LANGERHANS CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS

Proliferative disorders of Langerhans cells characterized by histiocyte infiltration of tissue, commonly due to BRAF V600E mutation.

History/PE Langerhans cell histiocytosis can present with multisystem involvement (eg, skin, lymph

nodes, liver, lung, CNS).

Skin or oral mucosa: Can present with eczematous rash (resembles Candida infection) and/or brown, purplish papules.

Lung: Can present with nonproductive cough, dyspnea, chest pain, constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss).

Bone: Can present with localized bone pain due to osteolytic lesions. CNS: Can manifest as cognitive dysfunction and ataxia. Diabetes insipidus: Present with polyuria, nocturia, and polydipsia due to hypothalamic-

bone pain due to dysfunction and ataxia. polyuria, nocturia, and May also-have impaired-glucose

pituitary axis (HPA) involvement. May also have associated endocrinopathies (hypogonadism, growth failure, impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes mellitus, and thyroid enlargement).

Diagnosis Bone or skin biopsy, pathology demonstrating collections of histiocytes and Langerhans cells (large ovoid mononuclear cells).

Treatment Treatment depends on the organ involved in the disease. Bone disease can be treated with curettage or radiotherapy. Skin involvement can be treated with topical steroids or methotrexate. Lymph node involvement can be treated with vinblastine chemotherapy. Steroids can also be considered when the lungs are involved, along with smoking cessation.

======================================
COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME

A pain syndrome accompanied by loss of function and autonomic dysfunction, usually occurring after trauma. Not linked with true nerve injury.

The disease has three phases: 1) Acute/traumatic: Development of pain → 2) Dystrophic: Progression of soft tissue edema, muscle wasting → 3) Atrophic: Limited movement, contracted digits, trophic skin. Radiograph shows severe demineralization of bones.

KEY FACT

Median nerve injury leads to the “benediction sign” caused by an inability to close the first through third digits. Ulnar nerve injury leads to the “claw hand” caused by an inability to open the fourth to fifth digits.

History/PE Diffuse pain occurs out of proportion to the initial injury, often in a nonanatomic

distribution. Pain is also unrelated to timing of initial injury.

Loss of function of the affected limb is seen. Sympathetic dysfunction occurs and may be documented by skin, soft tissue, or blood

======================================
OSTEOSARCOMA

Although a rare tumor, osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone in children and adolescents (Table 2.8-3). It tends to occur in the metaphyseal regions of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus, and it often metastasizes to the lungs. Bimodal age distribution occurs in young adults and patients >65 years of age. Risk factors for older patients are radiation, Paget disease, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and familial retinoblastoma.

Q

A 55-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer presents with low back pain (LBP) and bilateral leg weakness. On examination, he is found to have point tenderness on the lumbar spine and ↓ sensation in his legs. What is the best next step?

Diagnosis Best initial test: X-rays. These can show a Codman triangle (formation of periosteal new bone at the diaphyseal end of the lesion) or a “sunburst” pattern of the osteosarcoma (see Fig. 2.8-6) in contrast with both the multilayered “onion skinning” that is classic for Ewing sarcoma and the “soap bubble” appearance of giant cell tumor of bone (see Fig. 2.8-7).

Most accurate test: Bone biopsy. MRI and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or bone scan for staging and workup.

KEY FACT

The most common benign bone tumor is an osteochondroma. It commonly presents as a painless mass and does not typically require treatment—just serial monitoring with x-rays.

The best next step would be to obtain an MRI. MRI is the best study, but preventing permanent neurologic disability is the priority. Remember to consider multiple myeloma, which can present almost identically. Treatment is to administer steroids to relieve spinal cord compression resulting from likely bone metastasis.

Treatment Limb-sparing surgical procedures and preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy (eg,
======================================
A

methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin, ifosfamide)

Amputation possibly necessary

SEPTIC ARTHRITIS

An infection of the joint space that typically occurs after open injury or bacteremia.

History/PE Presents as a warm, red, immobile joint. Palpable effusions may also be present. Fevers and chills can be seen if the patient is bacteremic. Intense pain with brief joint movement (short arc sign) is pathognomonic. Typically unable to bear weight. Prosthetic joints greatly ↑ risk. Other risk factors include recent trauma, underlying joint disease (eg, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoarthritis), older age, recent articular injection, and bacteremia from endocarditis or intravenous (IV) drug use.

Diagnosis Most accurate test: Joint aspiration. See Table 2.8-4 and Figure 2.8-8

Treatment Empiric ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially until culture test results; then modification of therapy for specific organisms. Septic arthritis is considered a surgical emergency. Septic joints are considered surgical emergencies and are treated with joint drainage or debridement. Delay in treatment may lead to permanent joint destruction.
======================================
KEY FACT

Any patient presenting with a red, hot, and swollen joint should have joint aspiration/arthrocentesis to rule out septic arthritis.

A 15-year-old youth presents with several months’ history of pain in the upper part of his thigh. The pain is worse at night. A plain film shows a small lucent nidus. What over-the- counter (OTC) remedy is indicated?

KEY FACT

In sexually active individuals with joint pain, consider the diagnosis of gonococcal septic arthritis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae septic arthritis can present with asymmetric oligoarthritis, tenosynovitis, and skin rash.

OSTEOMYELITIS

Bone infection caused by direct spread from a soft tissue infection (80% of cases) is most common in adults, whereas infection caused by hematogenous seeding (20% of cases) is more common in children (metaphysis of the long bones) and patients who use injectable drugs (vertebral bodies). Common pathogens are outlined in Table 2.8-6. Patient characteristics are important to keep in mind, as they can clue you in to commonly associated pathogens.

Osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes should be treated with antibiotics targeting gram ⊕ organisms and anaerobes.

This adolescent patient is likely presenting with osteoid osteoma, a benign bone-forming tumor characterized by prostaglandin formation. Relief of pain is thus often achieved with NSAIDs. Tumors may resolve on their own, but surgical removal of the nidus may be necessary for symptom relief.

Diagnosis Labs: ↑ WBC count; ↑ erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)

levels in most cases. Blood cultures may be ⊕.

Imaging:

X-rays are often ⊝ initially but may show periosteal elevation within 10 to 14 days. Bone scans are sensitive for osteomyelitis but lack specificity.

MRI (the test of choice) will show ↑ signal in the bone marrow and associated soft tissue infection (see Fig. 2.8-9).

Most accurate test: Bone aspiration with Gram stain and culture. However, clinical diagnosis made by probing through the soft tissue to bone is usually sufficient, as aspiration carries a risk for infection.

Treatment Most accurate treatment: Surgical debridement of necrotic, infected bone followed by IV antibiotics for 4 to 6 weeks. Empiric antibiotic selection is based on the suspected organism and Gram stain.

The physician should consider clindamycin plus ciprofloxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, or oxacillin/nafcillin (for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus); vancomycin (for methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]); or ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin (for gram ⊝ bacteria).

Complications Chronic osteomyelitis, sepsis, septic arthritis. Long-standing chronic osteomyelitis with a draining sinus tract may eventually lead to squamous cell carcinoma (Marjolin ulcer).

KEY FACT

Penicillin and cephalosporins have minimal cross-reactivity. If a patient had an allergic rash to penicillin, cephalosporins are considered safe. If a patient had an anaphylactic reaction or developed angioedema while on penicillin, use a non–β-lactam antibiotic.

An 11-year-old boy with a history of multiple hospitalizations for pain crises, all related to his sickle cell anemia, presents with fever and severe pain in his right hand. Physical examination shows an area of redness, tenderness, and swelling near the right second metacarpal. Laboratory results show leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). MRI shows an area of ↑ intensity in the painful area. What pathogen is the most likely cause of his condition?

OSTEOARTHRITIS

A common chronic, noninflammatory arthritis of the synovial joints. Characterized by deterioration of the articular cartilage and osteophyte bone formation at the joint surfaces. Risk factors include age, female sex, prior joint trauma, malalignment, sedentary lifestyle, ⊕ family history, obesity, and a history of joint trauma. Osteoarthritis (OA) is considered primary if no underlying etiology is found. Secondary OA may be due to prior trauma, avascular necrosis (AVN), inflammatory arthritis, osteochondritis dissecans, and more.

History/PE Presents with crepitus, ↓ range of motion (ROM), and initially pain that worsens with activity and weight-bearing but improves with rest. Morning stiffness generally lasts for <30 minutes. Stiffness is also experienced after periods of rest (“gelling”). Bony nodes occurring on distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in the hands are called “Heberden nodes,” and the ones on the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are referred to as “Bouchard nodes.”

Salmonella is the most likely pathogen causing the patient’s condition. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause in patients without sickle cell disease and is the second most common organism that causes osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease.
======================================
KEY FACT

There is a minimal role for opioids in the treatment of osteoarthritis because potential risks outweigh benefits. If patients have refractory, severe pain and are unwilling or unable to

Laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers, are typically normal.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Physical therapy, weight reduction (if comorbid obesity present),

and NSAIDs. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may provide temporary relief.

Most definitive treatment: Surgery—consider joint replacement (eg, total hip/knee/shoulder arthroplasty) in advanced cases. Patients are at higher risk for developing osteoporosis.

OSTEOPOROSIS

Refer to Endocrinology chapter.

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

A systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic, destructive, inflammatory arthritis with symmetric joint involvement resulting in synovial hypertrophy and pannus formation, ultimately leading to erosion of adjacent cartilage, bone, and tendons. Risk factors include female sex, 35 to 50 years of age, smoking, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–death receptor (DR)4.

KEY FACT

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca secondary to Sjögren syndrome is a common ocular manifestation

of RA.

History/PE Insidious onset of prolonged morning stiffness (>30 minutes) occurs along with painful, warm swelling of polyarticular symmetric joints (wrists; metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joints; PIP joints of hands, ankles, knees, shoulders, hips, and elbows) for >6 weeks.

Rheumatoid nodules may form at bony prominences and near joints affected by the disease.

In advanced disease, ulnar deviation of the fingers is seen with MCP joint hypertrophy. RA also presents with ligament and tendon deformations (eg, swan-neck and boutonnière

deformities), vasculitis, atlantoaxial subluxation (↑ intubation risk), and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (if accompanying Sjogren syndrome is present). RA typically spares the lumbosacral spine.

KEY FACT

The DIP joint is spared in RA compared to OA and psoriatic arthritis, where the DIP is involved.

Diagnosis Diagnostic criteria (need ≥6 points):

↑ rheumatoid factor (RF) (IgM antibodies against Fc IgG) or the presence of anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies (1 point)

↑ ESR or CRP (1 point) Inflammatory arthritis of three or more joints (up to 5 points) Symptom duration >6 weeks (1 point) Exclusion of diseases with similar clinical presentations such as psoriatic arthritis,

gout, pseudogout, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Labs:

↑ ESR and CRP (nonspecific signs of inflammation); anemia of chronic disease is common.

Synovial fluid aspirate showing turbid fluid, ↓ viscosity, and an ↑ WBC count (2000– 50,000 cells/μL)

X-rays (not necessary to confirm RA):

Early: Soft tissue swelling and juxta-articular demineralization Late: Symmetric joint space narrowing and erosions

Treatment Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be started early. They include methotrexate (initial drug of choice), hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine. Second-line

agents include tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, rituximab (anti-CD20), and leflunomide.

NSAIDs or glucocorticoids can be used for symptom flares or while bridging to DMARD therapy.

KEY FACT

Hydroxychloroquine causes irreversible retinal toxicity. Patients must undergo regular screening while taking this medication for long periods (>5 years) to look for findings indicative of toxicity (“bull’s-eye” appearance).

Complications Articular manifestations: Joint deformation, osteopenia, OA Extra-articular manifestations: Anemia, rheumatoid nodules, scleritis, amyloidosis,

POLYMYOSITIS AND DERMATOMYOSITIS

Both diseases are progressive immune-mediated myopathies characterized by striated muscle inflammation manifesting as symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Polymyositis presents with muscle weakness; dermatomyositis is differentiated by cutaneous involvement. They most often affect patients 50 to 70 years of age; the male-to-female ratio is 1:2. Black individuals are affected more often than White individuals (see Table 2.8-8).

Aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are also muscle enzymes. In patients with unexplained elevation of AST and ALT (not due to alcohol abuse or liver disease) and especially if AST > ALT, creatine kinase (CK) should be checked to evaluate for myopathy.

Treatment Best initial treatment: High-dose corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) with taper after 4 to 6

weeks to ↓ the maintenance dose

Azathioprine and/or methotrexate used in steroid-resistant or intolerant cases

TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DISORDERS

Several factors contribute to the development of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, including joint trauma (eg, bruxism) and history of psychiatric illness (eg, depression, anxiety).

History/PE/Diagnosis Patients present with unilateral morning heading and with waxing and waning facial pain that worsens with jaw motion. The pain can be accompanied by tinnitus and may radiate to the ear and periorbital region and down the mandible.

On physical examination, muscles of mastication may be tender, tooth wear from bruxism can be present, and jaw movement may result in clicking or even locking that limits jaw opening.

The diagnosis of TMJ disorders is primarily based on history and physical examination findings.

Treatment Patient education and self-care measures: Avoidance of triggers and consumption of a

soft diet

corticosteroid injections SYNDROME some‘clinical features trigger points within

Pharmacology: NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections Dental splints if bruxism is suspected
======================================
MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROME

Myofascial pain syndrome shares some clinical features with fibromyalgia. It is characterized as a regional pain disorder having trigger points within fascia and muscles.

History/PE Patients complain of a deep aching pain, often accompanied by a burning sensation and

restricted active motion in the affected area.

Physical examination reveals indurated regions known as trigger points. Palpating a trigger point reproduces pain in another location known as the “target zone.” Myofascial pain syndrome differs from fibromyalgia, as the latter does not have indurated trigger points and the tender points are located within tissues other than muscles.

Treatment Multidisciplinary patient education, sleep hygiene, low-impact exercise, physical therapy, non-narcotic pain medications, antidepressants, gabapentin, and muscle relaxants.

SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS

Also called scleroderma; characterized by chronic inflammation leading to progressive tissue fibrosis through excessive deposition of types I and III collagen. Commonly manifests as CREST syndrome (limited form, 80% of cases), but can also occur in a diffuse form (20% of cases) involving the skin and multiple organ systems. Risk factors include female sex and age between 35 and 50 years.

Scleroderma renal crisis is characterized by an abrupt onset of hypertension and acute renal failure in patients with scleroderma. Early recognition is crucial, as scleroderma renal crisis has a high mortality rate if not treated.

Diagnosis Diagnosis and categorization depend on constellation of symptoms. RF and ANA may be ⊕. Ninety-five percent of patients will have ⊕ ANA. Antiscleroderma (anti-Scl)-70/antitopoisomerase-I is highly specific (>99%) but only has ∼20% to 45% sensitivity. These antibodies are associated with diffuse disease and poor prognosis.

RF may also be ⊕. Anticentromere antibodies are specific for CREST syndrome (see Table 2.8-9).

Severe disease may cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes.
======================================
KEY FACT

Presence of anti-RNA polymerase III antibody in scleroderma is a risk factor for renal crisis.

Treatment Organ-based treatment that includes frequent monitoring for progressive damage and

symptomatic support where necessary

Corticosteroids for acute flares (but they increase the patient’s risk for renal crisis); methotrexate for limited scleroderma

Calcium channel blockers (dihydropyridine) such as amlodipine for Raynaud phenomenon Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for treatment of renal crisis

Complications Mortality is most commonly caused by complications of ILD/pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and resulting renal or cardiac disease.

SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

A chronic multisystem autoimmune disorder related to antibody-mediated cellular attack and deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in any organ system, resulting in variable clinical manifestations and presentations. Black women are at highest risk. SLE usually affects women of childbearing age.

History/PE Presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss, and symmetric joint pain. Clinical heterogeneity and nonspecific symptoms present a diagnostic difficulty in many patients, making SLE a diagnosis of exclusion.

Diagnosis Best initial test: ESR >50 mm/hr (influenced by age). Most accurate test: Temporal artery biopsy. The physician should look for thrombosis; necrosis of the media; and the presence of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and giant cells.

Treatment Best initial treatment: High-dose prednisone immediately to prevent ocular involvement (or involvement of the remaining eye after onset of monocular blindness). If suspected as contribution to vision loss, give pulse-dose steroids.

A temporal artery biopsy to confirm diagnosis. However, do not delay treatment. Conduct a follow-up eye examination.

Complications

The most feared manifestation is blindness from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) secondary to occlusion of the posterior ciliary artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery, which itself is a branch of the internal carotid artery. Central retinal artery (a branch of the internal carotid artery) occlusion is less common; however, if affected it may initially present as transient vision loss.

Q

A 55-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a chief complaint of “blindness.” She states that she experienced a temporary loss of vision in her left eye. She has also been experiencing new headaches and soreness in her jaw. Her vision exam is unremarkable. What diagnostic exam should be ordered?

TAKAYASU ARTERITIS

Large-vessel autoimmune vasculitis affecting the aorta and primary branches. Common in Asian females <40 years of age. Diagnosis made through clinical presentation and imaging. Classic symptoms include aortic claudication, differential blood pressure in both upper extremities, and the absence of palpable pulses (pulseless disease). ESR and CRP are often highly elevated. Imaging (magnetic resonance angiography [MRA] or computed tomography angiography [CTA]) will show narrowing of aorta or its primary branches. Treatment calls for oral high-dose steroids.

BEHçET SYNDROME

Autoimmune vasculitis common in males of Turkish or Middle Eastern descent. Characterized by recurrent, painful oral and genital ulcers and uveitis. Thrombosis is a common cause of morbidity. To prevent recurrence, patients should be treated with colchicine. Topical steroids can treat oral and genital ulcers, with ophthalmic steroids treating ocular involvement.

FIBROMYALGIA

A chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder that primarily affects young females and is characterized by soft tissue and axial skeletal pain in the absence of joint pain. Inflammation is notably absent (see Table 2.8-10). Fibromyalgia may be difficult to distinguish from myofascial pain (<11 painful areas).

Avoidance of narcotics.

Monocular amaurosis fugax is associated with giant cell (temporal) arteritis and may progress to complete vision loss. A temporal artery biopsy should be obtained.
======================================
POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA

An inflammatory rheumatic condition characterized by aching and stiffness in the shoulders, hips, and neck. Associated with temporal arteritis. Risk factors include female sex and >50 years of age (see Table 2.8-10).

History/PE Patient presents with pain and stiffness of the shoulder and pelvic girdle musculature with

difficulty getting out of a chair or lifting arms above the head.

UPPER EXTREMITY

ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS

Adhesive capsulitis (“frozen shoulder”) is a pathology of the glenohumeral joint in which the shoulder loses its normal ROM. This condition can be either idiopathic or result from several predisposing conditions such as shoulder injury (eg, rotator cuff tear, humeral fracture, or surgery), subacromial bursitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, Dupuytren contracture, or paralytic stroke.

History/PE Adhesive capsulitis presents in middle-aged and older individuals. Patients complain of gradual onset of poorly localized, nagging shoulder pain that is worse

at night.

The pain is accompanied by a significant reduction in both active and passive shoulder ROM. Patients may particularly complain of their inability to reach overhead or difficulty in back scratching or putting on a coat.

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis. Based on demonstration of both active and passive shoulder mobility reduction in multiple planes. Imaging is not typically required unless to rule out another shoulder pathology.

Treatment Most cases are managed with ROM exercises and physical therapy. Cases having limited success with ROM exercises may be treated with corticosteroid

injections, as well as arthroscopic distention and surgical release and NSAIDs.

ROTATOR CUFF INJURIES

Rotator cuff pathology is a common cause of pain in older adults, and it typically relates to impingement, glenohumeral OA, or an acute traumatic event. The supraspinatus is most commonly torn, but the subscapularis, infraspinatus, or teres minor may also be involved. Sports that require overhand motion (eg, baseball, swimming) may cause tears in young adults. Impingement or tendinopathy may precede a full rotator cuff tear.
======================================
KEY FACT

Tendinitis is a slight misnomer, as a classic cellular inflammatory response is absent or minimal in cases of overuse tendinopathy. Tendinosis is a more appropriate term referring to chronic tendinopathy without cellular inflammation (eg, rotator cuff tendinopathy).

KEY FACT

Rotator cuff tears can be acute or chronic. Chronic tears cause gradual pain and typically are seen in older adults. Impingement syndrome involves pain caused by compression of soft tissue structures, and it may have a more insidious onset.

History/PE Impingement: Normal ROM but painful abduction and external rotation. Neer sign and

Hawkins test for impingement may be positive (see Table 2.8-11).

TABLE 2.8-11. Physical Examination Maneuvers for Shoulder Pathology

DISEASE TEST DESCRIPTION Impingement Neer Positive if pain upon passively raising an internally rotated arm (thumb pointing toward the floor). Arm should be halfway between forward elevation and abduction while being raised. Hawkins Positive if pain upon internally rotating an arm that is 90 degrees flexed at the shoulder and elbow Rotator cuff tear Drop arm Positive if patient drops their arm (due to pain or weakness) while slowly lowering it from 90 degrees of abduction

Positive if patient drops while slowly lowering it and external rotation. include trauma,

Tear: Painful and weak abduction and external rotation. Drop arm sign may be positive if supraspinatus is torn. Risk factors include trauma, dislocation, and age >40 years.

Diagnosis Impingement: X-ray Tear: If suspicion high (eg, preceding trauma, weakness, and ⊕ drop arm), MRI best next

test

Treatment Many patients improve with conservative management (eg, physical therapy). The physician may consider repair if patient is refractory or fails physical therapy.

COMPARTMENT SYNDROME

↑ pressure within a confined space that compromises nerve, muscle, and soft tissue perfusion. Occurs most commonly in the anterior compartment of the lower leg and in forearm secondary to trauma to the affected limb (fracture or muscle injury). Compartment syndrome can also occur due to nontraumatic causes such as (1) thrombosis leading to ischemia- reperfusion injury or (2) prolonged limb compression (eg, in a patient who overuses alcohol or drugs).

History/PE Symptoms develop acutely over several hours. Patient presents with Pain Out Of

Proportion (POOP) to physical findings; Pain with passive motion of the fingers and toes; and Paresthesias, Pallor, Poikilothermia, Pulselessness, and Paralysis (the six Ps). Paralysis and pulselessness occur as late signs of compartment syndrome.
======================================
KEY FACT

Volkmann contracture of the wrist and fingers is caused by compartment syndrome, which is associated with supracondylar humerus fractures. These fractures may affect the brachial artery and radial nerve. Ischemia results in fibrosis of dead muscle.

KEY FACT

Timeline of the six Ps in compartment syndrome: Early (nerve dysfunction) — Pain out of proportion, paresthesia Late (vascular insufficiency) — Pallor, poikilothermia → Paralysis, pulselessness

Diagnosis Based on history, serial examinations, and elevated compartment pressure >30 mm Hg (although not necessary). The physician should calculate delta pressure (diastolic pressure – compartment pressure); the diagnosis is ⊕ if delta pressure ≤30 mm Hg.

is © if delta pressure and + tissue perfusion. most important prognostic limb recovery approaches residual nerve dysfunction,

Treatment Emergent fasciotomy to ↓ pressures and ↑ tissue perfusion. Time to fasciotomy is one of the most important prognostic factors. If <6 hours from symptom onset, limb recovery approaches ∼100%. If >6 hours from symptom onset, residual nerve dysfunction, muscle death, and need for

amputation likelihood increase.

KEY FACT

Open fractures are an orthopedic emergency. Closed tibia and forearm fractures have higher rates of compartment syndrome. Patients should be taken to the operating room within 8 to 24 hours for irrigation and debridement followed by fracture repair. The physician should reduce infection risk with antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis.

RHABDOMYOLYSIS

Caused by muscle necrosis and subsequent release of byproducts into systemic circulation. Hallmark finding is elevated CK. Etiologies include direct muscle damage (trauma, compression, compartment syndrome), extreme exertion (power lifters, marathon runners), toxins, or a syndrome such as malignant hyperthermia.

History/PE Commonly presents with muscle pain and weakness; however, can be asymptomatic Dark or “bloody” urine secondary to myoglobinuria

Diagnosis ↑↑ serum CK, usually >1500 U/L or five times the upper limit of normal Urinalysis ⊕ for myoglobin, minimal RBCs, possibility of acute kidney injury (AKI) Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia

Treatment IV fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities Treatment of etiology if applicable (compartment syndrome, malignant hyperthermia)

Complications AKI occurs in 15% to 50% with rhabdomyolysis due to volume depletion and direct nephron injury from myoglobin acting as a direct toxin.

Q

A 37-year-old man is seen after a motorcycle accident. He complains of intense leg pain, tingling in his foot, and inability to move his toes. A physical examination reveals pain with passive motion of his toes and palpable dorsalis pedis pulses. An x-ray film confirms a tibial fracture. What is the best treatment?

CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

Entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist caused by ↓ size or space of the carpal tunnel, leading to paresthesia, pain, and occasionally paralysis. Can be precipitated by overuse of wrist flexors; associated with pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, RA, and amyloidosis

KEY FACT

Pronator syndrome (PS) is due to compression of the median nerve at the elbow. Symptoms include paresthesia in a similar distribution to carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients also have fewer night symptoms and may have a positive Tinel sign at the proximal, anterior forearm. One risk factor: Hypertrophic forearm muscles.

KEY FACT

Sensory loss in carpal tunnel syndrome is a late finding that spares the thenar eminence, as this area is supplied by the palmar sensory cutaneous nerve, which arises proximal to the carpal tunnel and passes over it.

History/PE Difficulty with daily activities such as typing, turning doorknobs, opening a bottle cap, and

driving

Presents with aching over the thenar area of the hand and proximal forearm Paresthesia or numbness seen in a median nerve distribution (first three and a half digits)

Symptoms that worsen at night and awaken patient from sleep Examination that shows thenar eminence atrophy (if disease is long-standing) Phalen maneuver and Tinel test ⊕ (see Fig. 2.8-15). Durkan test (carpal compression test)

is another provocative method to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.

(A) The Tinel test nerve. (B) The Phalen surfaces of the hand with median nerve distribution.

FIGURE 2.8-15. Carpal tunnel syndrome. (A) The Tinel test is performed by tapping the volar surface of the wrist over the median nerve. (B) The Phalen maneuver is performed by compressing the opposing dorsal surfaces of the hand with the wrists flexed together as shown. This causes tingling over the median nerve distribution. (Modified with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Diagnosis Usually a clinical diagnosis from symptoms and signs Electrodiagnostic tests: Nerve conduction studies and electromyography

Treatment Best initial treatment: Splinting the wrist in a neutral position at night and during the day

if possible

Medical treatment: Corticosteroid injection of the carpal canal and NSAIDs Most definitive treatment: Surgical decompression of the tunnel, a widely accepted

treatment, particularly for fixed sensory loss, thenar weakness, or intolerable symptoms with no improvement after splinting and/or glucocorticoids
======================================
Complications Permanent loss of sensation, hand strength, and fine motor skills.

GANGLION CYST

Fluid-filled cyst arising from tendon sheaths, ligaments, or joint connective tissue. Most commonly arises in the dorsum of the wrist (see Fig. 2.8-16)

FIGURE 2.8-16. Ganglion cyst. (Reproduced with permission from Vaishya R, Kapoor C, Agarwal AK, Vijay V. A rare presentation of ganglion cyst of the elbow. Cureus. 2016 Jul 1;8(7):e665. doi: 10.7759/cureus.665.)

History/PE A ganglion cyst commonly presents with a slowly growing mass overlying the joint and

causing wrist pain.

The mass will be rubbery, round, and firm. It will be relatively immobile due to association with joint connective tissue.

tissue. fluid-filled structure, and it multiloculated cyst or a

Diagnosis Transillumination will show a fluid-filled structure, and it can guide diagnosis. Ultrasound may differentiate a simple from a multiloculated cyst or a solid structure (eg, lipoma, tumor, nodule).

The best treatment is immediate fasciotomy for compartment syndrome (within 6 hours to prevent muscle necrosis) followed by fracture stabilization. Remember that nonpalpable pulses are a late finding.

Treatment Observation. Up to 50% of ganglion cysts spontaneously regress. Surgical excision for ganglion cysts that do not regress, are symptomatic, or have features

concerning for malignancy. The recurrence rate is ∼10%.

DUPUYTREN CONTRACTURE

Due to disorder in fibroblastic proliferation and deposition of collagen in the palmar fascia of the hand with progressive fibrosis. Dupuytren contracture often presents after the fifth decade of life, predominantly in White males.

History/PE Often begins as a painless nodule in the palm with progressive thickening and

development of palmar cords

A

Eventually advances to a permanent contracture and flexion of the digits with inability to extend

Mostly affects ulnar aspect of hands, with MCP and PIP joints of the fourth and fifth digits most commonly affected

Diagnosis Characteristic palmar nodules or cords, depending on clinical stage Physical examination demonstrating inability to extend the fingers or joints

Treatment Surgical correction with fasciotomy (transection) or fasciectomy (excision) of cords Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy less invasive but less effective in relieving contracture
======================================
Complications High recurrence rate, even after surgical correction.

AVASCULAR NECROSIS

AVN, also known as osteonecrosis or ischemic necrosis, is caused by disruption of proximal blood supply, leading to death of bone (see Fig. 2.8-17). Two commonly tested concepts are AVN of the scaphoid bone (after a fall onto an outstretched hand [FOOSH]) and AVN of the femoral head (associated with a variety of conditions).

Treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head with focal anatomic-resurfacing implantation (HemiCAP): Preliminary results of an alternative option. J Orthop Surg Res. 2015;10:56. Published 2015 Apr 28. doi:10.1186/s13018- 015-0199-3.)

History/PE Scaphoid necrosis: Pain at the anatomic snuff box after a FOOSH Femoral head necrosis: Dull or sharp pain in the affected hip Children: Idiopathic AVN (Legg-Calve-Perthes disease) or slipped capital femoral

epiphysis

Sickle cell disease, prolonged glucocorticoid or bisphosphonate use, femoral fracture

Diagnosis X-ray of the affected wrist or hip. MRI is gold standard for those with negative x-ray and

high suspicion for AVN.

In scaphoid fractures, x-rays possibly negative for 2 to 6 weeks after a fall. It is important to get delayed follow-up imaging to rule out necrosis or displacement.

Treatment Scaphoid AVN: Wrist splints after fall; surgical referral for displaced fractures or those

with neurovascular compromise

Femoral head AVN: Total hip replacement

RAYNAUD PHENOMENON

Abnormal vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries in response to cold, leading to characteristic progression of digit color changes reflecting pathologic process. Ischemia: Vasospasm of artery causing occlusion and pallor → pale “white” digits Cyanosis: Dilation of capillaries and filling of deoxygenated blood → “blue” digits Rubor: Resolution of arterial vasospasm and reperfusion → “red” digits

May be primary or associated with other autoimmune conditions. Test for ANA and RF to lead to diagnosis. First-line treatment is general avoidance of triggers. Pharmacologic treatment calls for calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine).
======================================
KEY FACT

triggered by cold temperatures treated with calcium channel BITE7-(WOUNDS

Raynaud phenomenon may be triggered by cold temperatures and stress. Keeping the body’s core warm is essential. It can be treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as nifedipine or amlodipine.

HAND INFECTIONS AND BITE WOUNDS

Acute hand infections and bites should be promptly evaluated and treated. Both animal and human bites should be empirically treated. A “fight bite” is a laceration from striking another’s mouth and should be carefully examined due to high mouth colonization and possibility for progression to a septic joint. Surgical debridement should be done by an orthopedic or hand specialist.

History/PE Presents with hand pain and erythema, often with loss of ROM due to edema Alarm signs: Crepitus, indicating possible necrotizing infection, and skin discoloration,

indicating necrosis or ischemia

Diagnosis Laboratory studies: Leukocytosis may assess severity of infection and help monitor

progression. Cultures of wounds can help guide antibiotic treatment.

Imaging: Plain radiographs should be first-line to evaluate bones for possible fracture or osteomyelitis, foreign bodies, affected joints, or subcutaneous gas.

Treatment Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be first-line until cultures can guide therapy. Treatment should be based on source of bite. Dog and cats—Pasteurella, Staphylococcus,

Streptococcus. Human—Eikenella, group A Streptococcus.

Necrotizing infections and severe infections require surgical debridement and source control to prevent permanent compromise.

Septic arthritis requires joint aspiration and urgent surgical debridement.

Complications Progression of infection can require emergent surgical intervention, and without proper treatment can lead to loss of digits, limb, or permanent disfigurement and disability.

LOWER EXTREMITY

OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) often presents in adolescent children in which a part of the subchondral bone detaches from the underlying bone (see Fig. 2.8-18). OCD has a propensity to affect boys. It results from repeated trauma in highly active children. The most common joints involved include the knee, elbow, and ankle (often with a history of ankle inversion).

FIGURE 2.8-18. Osteochondritis dissecans. Subchondral bone detaches from the underlying bone. (Reproduced with permission from Kanto R, Nakayama H, Iseki T, Yoshiya S. Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans in the lateral femoral condyle requiring osteochondral autograft as a revision procedure: A case report. J Med Case Rep. 2016;10:3 doi:10.1186/s13256-015-0795-1.)

Hx: Patients complain of dull, poorly localized joint pain that worsens with activity. Accompanying swelling, stiffness, crepitus, and tenderness may be present. In advanced stages of the disease, patients can have an antalgic gait (patients rotate the affected limb laterally to reduce pain from weight-bearing) and complain of a catching and locking sensation.

Dx: Based on visualization of subchondral bone fragment on plain radiograph. In case of high suspicion and normal radiograph, an MRI can be obtained.

Tx: Rest, physical therapy, and surgery (in severe disease).
======================================
BURSITIS

Inflammation of the joint bursa by repetitive use, trauma, infection, systemic inflammatory disease (eg, autoimmune disease), or crystalline disorders (eg, gout). Common sites of

bursitis include subacromial, olecranon, trochanteric, popliteal fossa (Baker cyst), prepatellar (housemaid’s knee), and infrapatellar bursae. Hx/PE: Presents as pain, tenderness, swelling, and reduction on active ROM but with limited impact on passive ROM. Presence of abrasion, overlying cellulitis, or puncture wound/history of bursal injection with accompanying fever and chills suggests a septic etiology (often due to S aureus).

Dx: Based on history and PE. In case of suspected septic or crystalline etiology, aspiration should be performed.

Tx: Activity modification and NSAIDs for nonseptic cases. In case of septic etiology, systemic antibiotics are required, with surgical debridement in selected cases.

PES ANSERINUS PAIN SYNDROME

Also called anserine bursitis. Common in young adults active in sports, overweight middle- aged females, and older adults with OA. Presents with localized pain at the anteromedial tibia at the insertion of the pes anserinus (just below the joint line) that is aggravated by overuse, obesity, knee OA, and pressure from the opposite knee while lying on the side. Pain typically develops over weeks and worsens overnight. Valgus stress test will not aggravate the pain, and x-rays will also be normal. Treatment includes NSAIDs and strengthening of quadricep muscles.

Q

A 23-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a swollen and erythematous right hand following an altercation at a bar a few days ago. The dorsum of the hand shows abrasions, and x-ray films reveal a fracture of the fifth metacarpal. What is the next step in management?

PATELLOFEMORAL PAIN SYNDROME

Anterior knee pain caused by overuse. Common in females, runners, cyclists, and athletes. Pain can be reproduced with knee extension or using stairs. Treatment calls for activity modification (often rest) and NSAIDs.

History/PE Presents with localized tenderness, ↓ ROM, edema, and erythema; possible history of trauma or inflammatory disease. Pain is reproducible with squatting, and it worsens with ascending or descending stairs. Diagnosis can occur with patellar tendonitis (localized pain directly beneath patella).
======================================
KEY FACT

Infection of the superficial bursae occurs after trauma to the skin. Infection of deep bursae is often iatrogenic following injections or aspirations.

Diagnosis Mainly a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and physical exam findings.

Needle aspiration indicated if septic bursitis is suspected. No labs or imaging is needed.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Rest, heat and ice, elevation, and NSAIDs. Patient should increase

quadriceps strength with physical therapy.

An intrabursal corticosteroid injection can be considered, but it is contraindicated if septic bursitis is suspected.

Septic bursitis should be treated with 7 to 10 days of antibiotics.

KEY FACT

In a child with gout and inexplicable injuries, consider Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase [HGPRT] deficiency).

MORTON NEUROMA

Neuropathic degeneration of nerves (most commonly between the third and fourth toes) that causes numbness, pain, and paresthesia. Often associated with a “clicking sensation” when palpating this joint space. Morton neuroma occurs in runners, and symptoms worsen when metatarsals are squeezed together (eg, from wearing high-heeled shoes or walking on hard surfaces). Treatment requires padded shoe inserts to decrease pressure on metatarsal heads or surgical removal.

shoe inserts to decrease arthritis resulting by disorders of urate

GOUT

Recurrent attacks of acute monoarticular arthritis resulting from intra-articular deposition of monosodium urate crystals caused by disorders of urate metabolism (↑ production or ↓ excretion). Risk factors include male sex, obesity, postmenopausal status in women, and binge drinking.

KEY FACT

Gout crystals appear yeLLow when paraLLel to the condenser.

If skin is broken in a boxer’s fracture, assume infection by human oral pathogens and treat with surgical irrigation, debridement, and IV antibiotics to cover Eikenella.

History/PE Presents with sudden onset of excruciating joint pain. Gout is associated with erythema, warmth, swelling, and decreased ROM. Fever and mild leukocytosis can be present.

Eighty percent of cases are monoarticular. Gout most commonly affects the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (podagra) and the midfoot, knees, ankles, and wrists; the hips and shoulders are generally spared.

Tophi (urate crystal deposits in soft tissue) can be seen with chronic disease and are
======================================
A

associated with tissue destruction (see Fig. 2.8-19). Tophi are virtually pathognomonic for gout and are painless and nontender. They can ulcerate and discharge a chalky white substance.

FIGURE 2.8-19. Tophaceous gout. Note the slowly enlarging nodule of the right second toe in a 55-year-old man who is hypertensive, takes hydrochlorothiazide, and overuses alcohol. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Uric acid kidney stones are seen with chronic disease.

Diagnosis Diagnosis requires joint synovial fluid aspiration because septic arthritis can present

similarly. Aspirate shows needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals (vs pseudogout; see Table 2.8-12).

Lab tests and imaging:

Serum uric acid is usually elevated (≥7.5 mg/dL), but patients may have normal or even decreased levels during an acute attack of gout. ESR and CRP are typically elevated, and joint fluid aspiration and analysis are required to clarify the diagnosis.

X-rays may show punched-out erosions with overhanging cortical bone (“rat-bite” erosions, see Fig. 2.8-21) that are seen in advanced gout.

======================================
KEY FACT

Causes of hyperuricemia: ↑ cell turnover (hemolysis, blast crisis, tumor lysis, myelodysplasia, psoriasis) Drugs: Cyclosporine, diuretics, low-dose salicylates Physiologic states: Dehydration, starvation, obesity

Disease: DI, HGPRT deficiency, G6P deficiency Diet (eg, ↑ red meat, alcohol) Diuretics Lead poisoning Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Salicylates (low dose)

Q

A 49-year-old man presents with a painful, swollen big toe after a night of heavy drinking. How does alcohol affect uric acid metabolism?

Treatment Acute attacks:

High-dose NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin) are first-line. NSAIDs should be avoided in cases of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), peptic ulcer disease, and for anticoagulated patients. Colchicine may also be used; it is most effective when used within 24 hours of attack onset.

Steroids are used when NSAIDs are ineffective or contraindicated (eg, renal insufficiency).

is preferable if only should be used: in case of two or more Maintenance medications Allopurinol and febuxostat. Contraindicated in

Intra-articular steroid injection is preferable if only one or two joints are involved. Otherwise, systemic steroids should be used.

Maintenance therapy is indicated in case of two or more attacks annually, presence of tophi, or structural joint damage. Maintenance medications include:

Xanthine-oxidase inhibitors: Allopurinol and febuxostat. Can ↑ incidence of urate nephropathy

Uricosuric agents: Probenecid. Contraindicated in patients with tophi, nephrolithiasis, or CKD

Weight loss and avoidance of triggers (eg, binge drinking, red meat) will prevent recurrent attacks in many patients.

KEY FACT

Allopurinol and febuxostat are both xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Allopurinol and febuxostat decrease metabolism of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, leading to profound toxicities, and they should be avoided in patients who are on azathioprine or mercaptopurine (6-MP).

PSEUDOGOUT

Pseudogout is acute synovitis presenting similarly to gout attacks. Flares are common in a setting of recent surgery or medical illness. It is a disease of older adults, characterized by calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition into the joint space. Peripheral joints are most commonly involved, classically the knee joint. Risk factors include hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism, and hypercalcemia.
======================================
KEY FACT

Colchicine inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis and is most effective in pseudogout when used within 24 hours of flare onset. However, it can cause diarrhea, neuromyopathy, and bone marrow suppression (neutropenia).

Hx/PE: Same as gout (see previous section). Dx: Based on joint aspiration showing rhomboid-shaped birefringent crystals. Imaging

classically reveals chondrocalcinosis (see Fig. 2.8-22).

Tx: Intra-articular steroids, NSAIDs, and colchicine.

Alcohol is a source of purines, which are metabolized into uric acid, increasing serum concentrations and predisposing patients to gout flares.

TRUNK

LOW BACK PAIN

Low back pain (LBP) is the second-leading symptom-related cause for office visits in the United States. Although often self-limited, it can also be a sign of more severe disease, including infection, malignancy, or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Routine imaging studies are not indicated in the majority of patients with acute LBP unless alarming symptoms are present.

KEY FACT

Most LBP is mechanical, so bed rest is contraindicated.

A

Red Flag Symptoms Patient histories involving back pain that would warrant further imaging include: Constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, chills, night sweats) Sensory or motor deficits (eg, paresthesia or urine retention) Suspicion of infection (eg, immunosuppressive drugs, recent spinal procedure,

endocarditis)

Risk factors for compression fracture (eg, glucocorticoid use, older age, osteoporosis) History of drug abuse or malignancy
======================================
KEY FACT

Red flags for LBP include >50 years of age, >6 weeks of pain, previous cancer history, severe pain, constitutional symptoms, neurologic deficits, and loss of anal sphincter tone.

HERNIATED DISK

Causes include degenerative changes, trauma, or neck/back strain or sprain. A herniated disk most commonly occurs (95%) in the lumbar region, especially at L5–S1 (most common site) and L4–L5 (second most common site).

severe, electricity-like pain older males pressure (eg, coughing, muscle weakness,

History/PE Presents with sudden onset of severe, electricity-like LBP, usually preceded by several

months of aching, “diskogenic” pain

coughing)

Associated with sciatica, paresthesia, muscle weakness, atrophy, contractions, or spasms A contralateral (crossed) straight-leg raise ↑ pain (highly specific but not sensitive) Large midline herniations can cause cauda equina syndrome

Diagnosis Diagnosed with a ⊕ passive straight-leg raise with increased pain (sensitive, not specific). Imaging: MRI (see Fig. 2.8-23) is the preferred test. It is necessary for cauda equina

syndrome or for a severe or rapidly progressing neurologic deficit.

x-ray causes fracture). overflow incontinence), equina syndrome, a

KEY FACT

Bowel or bladder dysfunction (urinary overflow incontinence), impotence, and saddle-area anesthesia are consistent with cauda equina syndrome, a surgical emergency.

Treatment Best initial treatments: NSAIDs in scheduled doses, physical therapy, and local heat. The

physician should not prescribe bed rest; continuation of regular activities is preferred.

Epidural steroid injection or nerve block: Patients who do not respond to initial treatment.

Most definitive treatment: Surgery—only in focal neurologic deficits, cauda equina syndrome, and in cases of persistent pain for at least 6 weeks.
======================================
SPINAL STENOSIS

Narrowing of the lumbar or cervical spinal canal, leading to compression of the nerve roots and spinal cord. Most commonly caused by degenerative joint disease; typically occurs in middle-aged or older adult patients

History/PE Spinal stenosis presents with neck pain, back pain that radiates to the arms or the buttocks

and legs bilaterally, and leg numbness/weakness.

In lumbar stenosis, leg cramping is worse with standing and with walking downhill. In lumbar stenosis, symptoms improve with flexion at the hips and bending forward,

which relieves pressure on the nerves, aka, the “shopping cart sign.”

KEY FACT

Neurogenic claudication or pseudoclaudication is an important feature of lumbar spinal stenosis and is characterized by worsening symptoms with walking and relief with sitting or lying down.

Diagnosis MRI is the main imaging modality to use.

Treatment Mild to moderate: Treatments include NSAIDs, weight loss, and abdominal muscle

strengthening.

Advanced: Epidural corticosteroid injections can provide relief. Refractory: Surgical laminectomy is needed in 75% of patients with refractory symptoms. Table 2.8-13 outlines the motor, reflex, and sensory deficits with which LBP is associated.

SPONDYLOLISTHESIS AND SPONDYLOSIS

Spondylosis is a common cause of LBP in preadolescent children and athletes with repetitive back extension and rotation (divers, gymnasts). It represents a bilateral fracture of the posterior arch, whereas spondylolisthesis involves the anterior displacement of vertebrae (usually L5, S1) due to a defect in the posterior arch. Hx/PE: Presents as chronic back pain exacerbated with lumber extension. Both

spondylolisthesis and spondylosis may be accompanied by neurologic dysfunction and palpable step-off in the lumbosacral area.

Dx: Primarily based on history/PE. Patients can follow prescribed bed rest for 2 weeks to see if there is a resolution of symptoms. If symptoms persist or if LBP danger signs are present (eg, night pain, neurologic symptoms), imaging should be sought.

Tx: Mainly centered around rest, symptom control (eg, stretching exercises), and close follow-up. However, if patients start to exhibit signs of neurologic injury (eg, radiculopathy), a spine surgery consult should be obtained.

Prognosis/complications: Usually complete recovery. Long-term complications from surgery include spinal canal stenosis and disk degeneration.

BRAIN

The brain is organized into diverse areas that allow it to carry out a wide variety of specific functions. Most of the sensory areas are located posterior to the central sulcus, whereas the motor areas are located anterior to the central sulcus. The visual cortex is in the occipital lobe, and the auditory cortex is in the temporal lobe. Further details are shown in Figure 2.9- 1.

The primary motor and somatosensory cortices can also be mapped to represent specific parts of the body. This is called the homunculus. Note the disproportionate representation of various areas of the body, based on the innervation density of nerve cells to these areas and the complexity of their functions (Fig. 2.9-2).

Neuroimaging helps assess complications of intracranial pathology such as herniation syndromes, as shown in Figure 2.9-3. The most common types of brain herniation include:

Falx cerebri Lateral ventricles Supratentorial Uncus Tentorium cerebelli Kernohan notch hemorrhage

FIGURE 2.9-3. Herniation syndromes. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Cingulate (subfalcine) herniation under the falx cerebri, which can compress the anterior cerebral artery.

Central/downward transtentorial herniation that leads to brainstem displacement with rupture of paramedian basilar artery branches and Duret hemorrhages in the brainstem. It is usually fatal.

Uncal transtentorial herniation, or herniation of the medial temporal lobe: Early herniation leads to ipsilateral blown pupil (secondary to ipsilateral cranial nerve [CN] III compression) and contralateral hemiparesis. Late presentation leads to coma and Kernohan phenomenon (ipsilateral hemiparesis due to contralateral compression against the Kernohan notch and a subsequent misleading contralateral blown pupil).

Cerebellar tonsillar herniation into the foramen magnum, which compresses the brainstem and may lead to coma and death.
======================================
KEY FACT

Onn

A “blown pupil” suggests ipsilateral third nerve compression secondary to uncal herniation.

CIRCLE OF WILLIS AND ARTERIAL SUPPLY/VENOUS DRAINAGE OF BRAIN

There are three major blood vessels arising from the circle of Willis to supply the brain, and the respective cortical territories supplied by them are shown in Figure 2.9-4.

& Anterior cerebral artery (supplies anteromedial surface) B Middle cerebral artery (supplies lateral surface) ] Lacunar vessels (supply subcortical structures) I] Posterior cerebral artery (supplies posterior and inferior surfaces) Anterior Anterior Posterior Posterior

common sites (∼85% of all intracranial aneurysms) are the junction of the anterior communicating artery with the anterior cerebral artery (35%), junction of the posterior communicating artery with the internal carotid artery (30%), and bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery (22%).

MENINGES

The brain and the spinal cord are protected by layers of membranous covering (meninges) that protect them from mechanical damage and help provide a structural framework for the vasculature. There are three layers of meninges: the outermost dura mater, the innermost pia mater, and the one in between called the arachnoid mater, as shown in Figure 2.9-6.

Bridging veins Arachnoid Dura mater mater Subarachnoid

FIGURE 2.9-6. Different layers of meninges. (Modified with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Dura mater: Two-layered thick connective tissue sheath that houses the dural venous sinuses, which empty into the internal jugular veins. Blood supply comes from the middle meningeal artery and vein. Nerve supply is from CN V (anterior and middle cranial fossa), CN X (posterior fossa), sympathetics, and C1–C3 cervical nerves.

Arachnoid mater: Avascular middle layer that gives rise to small projections called arachnoid granulations, which allow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to re-enter the circulation. CSF is present underneath this layer of the meninges in a space called the subarachnoid space.

meninges that is very cord. mater are commonly inflammation of these

Pia mater: Innermost layer of the meninges that is very thin and tightly adhered to the surface of the brain and spinal cord.

The pia mater and the arachnoid mater are commonly referred to collectively as the leptomeninges. Meningitis refers to inflammation of these layers.
======================================
LUMBAR PUNCTURE

Lumbar punctures are one of the most commonly used examinations to diagnose a central nervous system (CNS) problem. They are commonly performed distal to the inferior tip of the spinal cord, below the level of the lumbar (L)1–L2 vertebrae in adults (L3–4 and L4–5 are common locations) and below the L4 vertebra in children. Lumbar puncture entails piercing the subarachnoid space (which extends to the lower border of the sacral [S2] vertebra and contains the CSF). The layers pierced by the needle to enter this space are shown in Figure 2.9-7.

PERIPHERAL AND CRANIAL NERVES

Some commonly tested CN lesions appear in Table 2.9-1.

TABLE 2.9-1. Cranial Nerve Lesions

CRANIAL NERVE CN Ill FEATURES CN Ill nerve comprises both motor (centrally located) and parasympathetic (peripherally located) components. Common causes include: = Ischemia —> pupil sparing (motor fibers affected more than parasympathetic fibers) = Uncal herniation > coma » Posterior communicating (PCom) artery aneurysm — sudden-onset headache = Cavernous sinus thrombosis — proptosis, involvement of CNs IV, V1/V2, VI « Midbrain stroke > contralateral hemiplegia Motor output to extraocular muscles and levator palpebrae superioris—affected primarily by vascular disease (eg, diabetes mellitus) due to J diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to the interior fibers from compromised vasculature on the outside of the nerve. Signs: ptosis, “down-and-out" gaze. For parasympathetic output—fibers on the periphery first affected by compres- sion (eg, posterior communicating artery aneurysm, uncal herniation). Signs: diminished or absent pupillary light reflex, “blown pupil,’ often with “down-and- out” gaze. CNIV Pupil higher in the affected eye. Characteristic head tilt to contralateral/unaffected side to compensate for lack of intorsion in affected eye. Patient has diplopia, most severe when attempting to look down and in (eg, going downstairs, reading). CNV Deviation of jaw toward the side of the lesion due to unopposed actions of oppo- site pterygoid muscle. CNVI Affected eye unable to abduct and is displaced medially in primary position of gaze. CNX Deviation of uvula away from side, dysarthria due to unilateral paralysis of vocal cord. CN XI Weakness turning head away from side of lesion (sternocleidomastoid) with drooped shoulder (trapezius). CN XII = Deviation of tongue toward side of the lesion due to strong action of contralateral genioglossus overpowering the weak muscles on the affected side.

Facial Nerve Palsy Facial weakness is broadly categorized into either upper or lower motor neuron weakness. UMN facial weakness is most often due to a stroke in the contralateral hemisphere while LMN facial weakness is most often due to a lesion of the facial nerve itself (Table 2.9-2).
======================================

TYPE Upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion DESCRIPTION Lesion of the motor cortex: contralateral paralysis of the lower face only. Lower motor neuron (LMN) Peripheral ipsilateral facial paralysis with inability to close the lesion eye on the involved side. Bell palsy is usually due to herpes simplex reactivation. Gradual recovery occurs in most cases; however, prednisone speeds recovery. Other causes Can be congenital but may also appear in adults. Facial nerve palsy may develop slowly when due to facial nerve schwan- noma. It also is seen as a complication in AIDS, Lyme disease, Sarcoidosis, parotid Surgery, Tumors, and Diabetes.

TABLE 2.9-6. Spinal Cord Lesions

AREA AFFECTED DISEASE Poliomyelitis and spinal mus- cular atrophy CHARACTERISTICS LMN lesions only, caused by destruction of anterior horns; presents with flaccid paralysis. Poliomyelitis is caused by enterovirus (picornavirus, RNA), transmitted via fecal-oral route, Similar lesions and symptoms may occur with West Nile virus infection. Lumbar puncture (LP) shows pleocytosis (neutrophils first and then lymphocytes) with slightly elevated protein and normal glucose. Treatment calls for supportive therapy and rehabilitation, Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is due to mutation in SMN1 and SMN2 genes. It presents with weak- ness and muscle wasting in limbs, respiratory, or brainstem muscles, Diagnosis relies on genetic testing (prenatal and postnatal); normal CSF findings and normal creatine kinase (CK) levels. Supportive therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Multiple sclerosis Can be caused by infections (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV}), immune disorders, environmental factors (eg, vitamin D deficiency), and genetic factors. Leads to focal inflammation and macroscopic plaques with injury to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and subsequent neurodegeneration. Features: Demyelination involves patchy areas of the subcortical white matter, brainstem, and spinal cord, mostly cervical region. Optic nerve demyelination leads to monocular vision loss. Diagnosis: Clinical + MRI + to rule out other causes. Lesions are disseminated in space and time. Treatment: Glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, interferon-beta preparations, and dimethy! fumarate modify disease course. Treat underlying cause for relapse and symptoms of neurologic issues- course of IV steroids (methylprednisolone) can hasten recovery from flare or relapse. Transverse myelitis Can be an acquired, focal, inflammatory disorder that usually is a part of multiple sclerosis. However, it can occur with infections by enterovirus, HIV, Mycoplasma, Treponema pallidum, and others. Presentation: Most commonly in thoracic levels, leads to paraplegia with loss of bladder/bowel function. It can have both UMN and LMN signs. Pathology: Perivascular infiltration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Diagnosis: Exclude cord compression first with MRI and then do LP. Treatment: High-dose intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids, pain management. Lesion Brown-Séquard hemisection Caused most commonly by trauma to the spinal cord, Leads to contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation one to two levels below the lesion and ipsilateral hemiparesis and diminished dorsal column sensation (vibration and propriocep- tion) below the level of the lesion, Amyotrophic lateral scle- rosis (ALS) Commonly known as Lou Gehrig disease in the United States and motor neuron disease in the United Kingdom. Combined UMN and LMN deficits with no sensory or oculomotor deficits; both UMN and LMN signs. Commonly presents as asymmetric painless weakness, fasciculations, and eventual atrophy and weakness of arms and legs; fatal. Riluzole treatment has modest benefit by J presynaptic gluta- mate release, For Lou Gehrig disease, give riluzole.

HEADACHES

Headaches can either be primary/idiopathic (eg, migraine, cluster, tension type) or secondary (resulting from underlying disease, such as tumor or intracranial hemorrhage). The differences in these types of headaches are discussed in Table 2.9-7.

Headache CLUSTER HEADACHE Severe pain behind the eye, usually unilateral, and usually in smokers Without preceding aura and 15- 180-minute headaches that

MIGRAINE HEADACHE

Recurrent headache disorder with attacks that last 4 to 72 hours. Headache typically unilateral, pulsating, and moderate or severe in intensity and aggravated by routine physical activity. Usually preceded by auras (auditory or visual most common). Affects women more than men; often familial; onset usually by teens to early 20s, but peak age is 30 to 39 years. Linked to changes in vascular tone and neurotransmitters (especially calcitonin gene-related peptide [CGRP]). Triggers: Certain foods (eg, red wine, cheese), fasting, stress, menses, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), bright light, and disruptions in normal sleep patterns, among others. Increased stroke risk in women with classic migraine headaches who take OCPs and smoke.

Diagnosis Based on history and recognition of pattern of headache (usually preceded by an aura and

a trigger). Physician should query about past events that may have started the headache at first.

Recognition of associated features such as nausea, dizziness, light sensitivity, smell changes, and disturbed bowel movements. Headaches typically last 4 to 72 hours (untreated or successfully treated), with two of four characteristics (unilateral, pulsating, moderate/severe pain intensity, aggravated by routine physical activity) and association with nausea/vomiting or photophobia/phonophobia. At least five attacks needed for migraine diagnosis.

Treatment Avoidance of known triggers Abortive therapy, including triptans (after over-the-counter [OTC] nonsteroidal anti-

inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] have failed), alone or in addition to other analgesics such as naproxen. The physician should consider symptomatic treatment for nausea. IV metoclopramide can be used for abortive therapy in the ED. Other treatments include ergots or CGRP antagonists (rimegepant, ubrogepant).

Prophylaxis for frequent or severe migraines, including anticonvulsants (eg, valproate, topiramate), tricyclic antidepressants ([TCAs], eg, amitriptyline), and β-blockers (propranolol; first-line prevention in pregnant patients). Erenumab blocks CGRP action and has a prophylactic role. Chronic cases may benefit from injection of botulinum toxin.

Routine aerobic exercise and good sleep hygiene.

women; average age of of headache.
======================================
CLUSTER HEADACHE

Men are affected more often than women; average age of onset is 25 years. Patients who smoke have a higher risk of this type of headache.

History/PE Presents as a brief, excruciating, unilateral, periorbital headache that lasts from 30 minutes to 3 hours, during which time the patient tends to be extremely restless. Patients do not have auras (vs migraine headache).

Tends to occur in clusters of time, affecting the same part of the head at the same time of day (commonly during sleep) during a certain season of the year.

Associated autonomic symptoms include ipsilateral lacrimation, conjunctival injection, Horner syndrome, and nasal stuffiness.

KEY FACT

If a 25-year-old man wakes up repeatedly during the night with unilateral periorbital pain associated with ipsilateral lacrimation, think cluster headache.

Diagnosis Classic presentations with a history of repeated attacks over an extended period do not need imaging. First episodes require a workup (eg, MRI, carotid artery ultrasound) to exclude structural brain lesion or disorders associated with Horner syndrome (eg, carotid artery dissection, cavernous sinus infection).

Treatment Acute therapy: High-flow O2 or sumatriptan injection Prophylactic therapy: Verapamil—first-line treatment, typically prescribed with

prednisone (10-day course); alternatives include lithium, valproic acid, and topiramate

TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE

Hx: Presents with tight, bandlike pain around the head that is triggered by fatigue or stress. Nonspecific symptoms (eg, anxiety, poor concentration, difficulty sleeping) may also be seen.

KEY FACT

If a 30-year-old woman complains of headaches at the end of the day that worsen with stress and improve with relaxation or massage, think tension-type headache.

pressing/tightening quality, mild to moderate intensity, and not aggravated by routine physical activity. The physician should rule out giant cell arteritis in patients >65 years of age with new headaches (usually accompanied by jaw claudication) by obtaining an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), even if headaches are mild with no associated constitutional or vascular symptoms.

(ESR), even if headaches baths, and avoidance of abortive therapy.

Tx: Relaxation, massage, hot baths, and avoidance of exacerbating factors. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line abortive therapy.
======================================
SECONDARY HEADACHES

The physician should consider secondary headaches when “red flags” (eg, sudden onset, great severity, nocturnal presentation, age >65 years of age, with focal neurologic symptoms, post– head trauma) are present.

History/PE Significant findings include fever or rash (consider meningitis or other infectious causes),

jaw claudication (specific for temporal arteritis), or constitutional symptoms such as weight loss (associated with neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious conditions).

Photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness can be associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and meningitis caused by meningeal irritation.

Full general and neurologic examinations, including a funduscopic examination, should occur.

Neurologic sequelae: The physician should look for diplopia, altered mental status or associated symptoms (numbness, weakness, dizziness, ataxia, visual disturbances), papilledema, or pupillary abnormalities (partial CN III palsy or Horner syndrome).

KEY FACT

Headache red flags—First, worst, sudden onset of most severe headache ever; neurologic sequelae; nocturnal headache; morning vomiting; onset of headache >65 or <10 years of

age; focal neurologic signs or symptoms; papilledema; headache subsequent to head trauma.

Diagnosis Based on the etiology.

If SAH is suspected: Procure a head CT without contrast. If CT is negative, perform a lumbar puncture to look for xanthochromia, which, if positive, supports the diagnosis of SAH.

In the emergency room, when SAH is suspected:

Check ABCs and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Consider early intubation if required. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines and start fluid infusion to maintain intravascular

volume.

Obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) to check for systemic infections. If temporal arteritis is suspected, obtain an ESR.

CT of the head is indicated for “red flag” symptoms.

Q

A 28-year-old woman with no prior medical history presents with throbbing, unilateral headache that is exacerbated by menstruation and minimally relieved by acetaminophen and lying in a dark room. She would like something that would provide more symptomatic relief. What abortive therapy should the physician prescribe?

menstruation and minimally like something that the physician prescribe? of headaches. Some whereas’cases of temporal

Treatment Directed toward underlying cause of headaches. Some conditions such as SAH may

require emergency surgery, whereas cases of temporal arteritis may require steroid use.

Analgesics administered for pain relief as search for underlying disorders begins.
======================================
TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA

Recurrent, severe, and shocklike shooting or stabbing pain along distributions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), often triggered by cold, minor trauma, or even chewing food or brushing teeth. The pain is often unilateral. It lasts a maximum of 2 minutes.

Pathophysiology: Compression of trigeminal nerve root most common cause. Demyelination occurs in multiple sclerosis.

Dx: Clinical, with precipitation by innocuous stimulus and not accounted for by another diagnosis. If bilateral, the physician should suspect multiple sclerosis.

Ddx: Herpes zoster–induced trigeminal neuropathy, postherpetic neuropathy. Tx: First line with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. Surgery (microvascular

decompression and rhizotomy, among various options) is required for refractory cases only.

VASCULAR DISORDERS

TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. Most TIAs last 5 to 10 minutes, but can rarely last up to 24 hours. The highest risk for stroke is on the day following the TIA, a risk estimated with the ABCD2 score.

Pathophysiology Embolism, lacunar, or small-vessel obstruction; low flow in a large vessel.

Diagnosis Based on clinical features of transient attack (transient monocular blindness, aphasia/dysarthria, hemianopia, hemiparesis, or sensory loss).

Treatment If symptoms are ongoing and potentially disabling: Emergency evaluation for intravenous

(IV) thrombolysis + thrombectomy

If symptoms resolve or are ongoing but nondisabling: Evaluation with MRI or neurovascular imaging to rule out stroke

Once cause is identified, a plan is implemented to reduce the risk of future stroke by use of medications (antiplatelet therapy), modification of stroke risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes), or carotid endarterectomy

modification of stroke with migraine therapy.

This patient’s symptoms are consistent with migraine headaches. The physician should prescribe a triptan for abortive therapy.
======================================
STROKE

Disruption of cerebral blood flow leads to death of brain cells, resulting in acute onset of focal neurologic deficits. A stroke can be ischemic (80%) or hemorrhagic (20%). Table 2.9-8 contrasts modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors associated with stroke. Common etiologies are listed later.

Diagnosis Best initial step: Head CT without contrast (see Fig. 2.9-9A) to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke and identify potential candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Ischemic strokes <6 hours old are usually not visible on CT scan.

Check blood glucose first. Labs to draw immediately, in case thrombolytic therapy or

intervention may be required, include CBC, prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT), cardiac enzymes and troponin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine. Diffusion-weighted MRI (follow-up to CT) (see Fig. 2.9-9B) to identify early ischemic

changes not detected on CT.

Determine underlying cause of stroke:

Cardioembolic: ECG; echocardiogram; Holter monitor if initial ECG normal. Thrombotic: Carotid ultrasonography; MRA; CT angiography (CTA); transcranial

Doppler; conventional angiography (see Fig. 2.9-9C).

Other potential causes that should be worked up if there is a high index of suspicion: Hypercoagulable states; sickle cell disease; vasculitis.

======================================
Ischemic stroke, hospital (emergency department):

Airway support for patients with low GCS (<8) or with bulbar dysfunction. Supplemental oxygen to keep SpO2 >94% only in hypoxic patients. Treatment of hypotension for adequate organ perfusion. Use of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for diagnosis and assessment. Emergency brain imaging on hospital arrival: Noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT)

head is investigation of choice.

Assessment of blood glucose levels and treatment to keep levels between 140 and 180

mg/dL.

IV alteplase indicated in patients without contraindications; consideration of mechanical thrombectomy. Give alteplase even if thrombectomy is being considered (especially for anterior large vessel occlusions within 24 hours of presentation).

Thrombolytics (tissue plasminogen activators [tPAs]) if <3 to 4.5 hours since onset of stroke and no bleeding or absolute contraindications. Permissive hypertension is allowed in stroke for perfusion of ischemic area, but patient’s systolic blood pressure (SBP) must be <185 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <110 mm Hg for tPA.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) if >3 hours since onset of stroke/TIA. If BP is high but patient is eligible for alteplase, lowering of BP to <185/110 mm Hg

slowly before therapy initiation. Use labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine.

Treatment of high (>200 mm Hg SBP or >120 mm Hg DBP) or low BP prior to initiating treatment for stroke. Raised BP can lead to further injury (cerebral edema, hemorrhagic transformation, or expansion of hematoma), whereas a low BP can lead to further infarction and perihematomal ischemia. Treatment goals include:

======================================
SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE

Etiologies of SAH include ruptured saccular aneurysms (berry aneurysms), arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and trauma.

History/PE

Aneurysmal SAH presents with an abrupt-onset, intensely painful “thunderclap” headache, often followed by neck stiffness (caused by meningeal irritation). Other signs of meningeal irritation, including photophobia, nausea/vomiting, and meningeal stretch signs (Kernig and Brudzinski signs), can also be seen.

More than one third of patients will give a history of a “sentinel bleed” (“warning leak”) days to weeks before presentation.

In the absence of neurosurgical intervention, rapid development of obstructive hydrocephalus or seizures often leads to ↓ arousal or frank coma and death.

KEY FACT

SAH = “the worst headache of my life” with sudden onset. Migraine = a gradually worsening headache (peak intensity >30 minutes)

KEY FACT

Xanthochromia (blood on an LP) is seen in two situations—herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis and SAH.

Conditions associated with berry aneurysms that can MAKE an SAH more likely— Marfan syndrome Aortic coarctation Kidney disease (autosomal dominant, polycystic) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Sickle cell anemia; Smoking tobacco Atherosclerosis History (familial); Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia

Treatment Most definitive treatment: Neurosurgery. May perform angiographic coiling and/or

stenting to stabilize aneurysm first.

Prevention of rebleeding (most dreaded complication and most likely to occur in the first 24 hours) by maintenance of SBP <150 mm Hg until the aneurysm has been coiled or clipped. Choice between coiling and clipping dependent on site of lesion, neck of aneurysm, and availability. Generally, coiling is preferred.

↓ ICP by raising the head of the bed and instituting hyperventilation in an acute setting (<30 minutes after onset).

Treatment of hydrocephalus through a lumbar drain, serial LPs, or ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE

Bleeding within brain parenchyma. Commonly affects deep brain regions such as the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, pons, and cerebellum. Some risk factors include hypertension, tumor, and illicit drug use. Hypertension is the most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage, followed by amyloid angiopathy (in older adults).

History/PE Early symptoms/signs: Focal motor or sensory deficits that often worsen as the

hematoma expands

Late symptoms/signs: Features of increased ICP (eg, vomiting and headache, bradycardia, reduced alertness)

Diagnosis Immediate noncontrast head CT (see Fig. 2.9-12). The physician should look for hyperdense areas, mass effect, or edema that may predict herniation.

FIGURE 2.9-12. Intracerebral hemorrhage.

Herniation is a medical emergency. Treat initially with mannitol or hypertonic saline in all patients, followed with emergency decompressive craniectomy to allow edema to expand outward.
======================================
SUBDURAL AND EPIDURAL HEMORRHAGE

Patients who present after head trauma with headache, focal neurologic deficits, and confusion should always be assumed to have a subdural or epidural hematoma and are in need of urgent neuroimaging. Overall, subdural hematomas are more common in the elderly, whereas epidural hematomas are more common in younger individuals. See Table 2.9-10.

TABLE 2.9-10. Subdural vs Epidural Hemorrhage

======================================
KEY FACT

Altered mental status associated with an expanding epidural hematoma occurs within minutes to hours and classically includes acute loss of consciousness → lucid interval → gradual loss of consciousness. With a subdural hematoma, such changes can occur within days to weeks.

CAVERNOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS

The cavernous sinus is a blood-filled collection of venous sinuses on either side of the pituitary gland. Common etiologies involve uncontrolled infections of central facial skin, the orbit, or nasal sinuses that lead to septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative agent. Current antimicrobials have greatly ↓ both incidence and mortality. However, this can also occur in the setting of trauma or postsurgery in patients with thrombophilia.

History/PE Headache is the most common presenting symptom. Patients may present with orbital pain, edema, diplopia, other CN signs secondary to oculomotor, abducens, trigeminal, or trochlear involvement. On examination, they

typically appear ill and have a fever.

Late findings: Altered mental status such as confusion, drowsiness, or coma suggests spread to the CNS or sepsis.

Diagnosis MRI (with gadolinium and magnetic resonance [MR] venography) is the main method for

diagnosis, but CTA and CT venography are also often used for diagnosis.

Lab studies show ↑ WBC count. Blood cultures reveal the causative agent in up to 50% of cases.

Treatment Cavernous sinus thrombosis calls for aggressive and empirical treatment with broad- spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin + third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (eg, ceftriaxone or cefepime).

Metronidazole covers anaerobic infection from sinus or dental sources. Antifungal therapy is required for fungal cases. IV antibiotics are recommended for at least 3 to 4 weeks. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin may be used

to decrease mortality. This may be required for several months.

Surgical drainage may be necessary if there is no response to antibiotics within 24 hours.

contrast before other precede LP in light
======================================
KEY FACT

Procurement of a head CT without contrast before other imaging to evaluate for hemorrhage or structural changes. Imaging should precede LP in light of the risk for herniation.

COMA AND ENCEPHALOPATHY

A state of “unarousable unresponsiveness,” ie, unconsciousness marked by limited to no response to stimuli. Lesser states of impaired arousal are known as “obtundation” or “stupor.” Coma is caused by dysfunction of both cerebral hemispheres or the brainstem (pons or higher), which stems from structural or toxic-metabolic insults. Common causes may include encephalopathy (hypoxic/ischemic), diffuse axonal injury, brainstem herniation, electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypoglycemia), toxins, and central pontine myelinolysis.

History/PE Obtain a complete medical history from witnesses, including current medications (eg,

sedatives).

Conduct thorough medical and neurologic examinations, including assessments of mental status, spontaneous motor activity, muscle tone, breathing pattern, fundoscopy (to look for papilledema), pupillary resting diameters and responses to light response, eye movements, corneal reflex, gag reflex, and motor or autonomic responses to noxious stimuli applied to the limbs, trunk, and face (eg, retromandibular pressure, nasal tickle).

Diagnosis Typically made by a combination of the history/physical examination and laboratory tests or

neuroimaging:

Best initial step: Check of glucose, electrolytes, calcium; procurement of renal panel, liver function tests (LFTs), arterial blood gases (ABGs), a toxicology screen, and blood and CSF cultures.

Next step: Vital signs, ventilatory pattern, neurologic examination. The physician can identify treatable conditions such as infection, metabolic conditions, seizures, intoxications/overdose, and surgical lesions.

Test of choice: CT head. MRI is superior for encephalitis, early strokes, diffuse axonal injury (DAI), and multiple small hemorrhages. LP and electroencephalography (EEG) should also be part of the diagnostic workup when neuroimaging and metabolic studies have not disclosed the etiology.

Procurement of an MRI to exclude structural changes and ischemia (eg, brainstem).

A 59-year-old man with prior medical history of polycystic kidney disease is admitted for treatment of SAH. Four hours after admission, he develops weakness in his left arm. What is the cause of this new finding?

Rule out catatonia, conversion unresponsiveness, “locked-in” syndrome, or persistent vegetative state (PVS), all of which can be confused with true coma (see Table 2.9-11).

Stabilize the patient: Attend to ABCs. Reverse the reversible: Administer DONT—Dextrose, Oxygen, Naloxone, and

Thiamine.

Identify and treat the underlying cause and associated complications. Prevent further damage.

1 A

Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) is suspected, as aphasia and contralateral sensory loss and weakness are part of the description. CT of brain without contrast should be done to rule out hemorrhage and assess whether tPA should be initiated.
======================================
2 A

This patient’s focal weakness is probably caused by ischemia secondary to vasospasm, so nimodipine administration could prevent this adverse event.

3 A

New onset of neurologic symptoms within 24 hours following an SAH is most likely caused by rebleeding of the aneurysm (as opposed to ischemia days after, which is caused by vasospasm).

APHASIA

A general term for speech and language disorders. Usually results from lesions (eg, strokes, tumors, abscesses) in the “dominant hemisphere.” The left hemisphere is dominant in >95% of right-handed people and in 60% to 80% of left-handed people.

BROCA/EXPRESSIVE APHASIA

A disorder of spoken and/or written language production with intact comprehension. Caused by an insult to the Broca area in the posterior inferior frontal cortex (see Fig. 2.9-13). Often secondary to a left superior middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Also known as motor aphasia.

History/PE Presents with impaired speech production, frustration with awareness of deficits, arm and facial hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and apraxia of the oral muscles. Speech is described as “telegraphic” with few words and frequent pauses.

KEY FACT

Broca aphasia = motor aphasia, expressive aphasia, or nonfluent aphasia Wernicke aphasia = sensory aphasia, receptive aphasia, or fluent aphasia

with intermediate repetition is impaired.

Treatment Speech therapy (varying outcomes with intermediate prognosis).

KEY FACT

In true Broca and Wernicke aphasia, repetition is impaired. If repetition is intact, the deficit is called transcortical motor aphasia (TMA) or transcortical sensory aphasia (TSA), and it is caused by a lesion around either the Broca area or the Wernicke area, respectively. Also called secondary aphasia.

WERNICKE/RECEPTIVE APHASIA

A disorder of language comprehension with intact yet nonsensical production. Caused by an insult to the Wernicke area in the left posterior superior temporal (perisylvian) lobe. Often secondary to left inferior/posterior MCA embolic stroke (see Fig. 2.9-13).

SEIZURE DISORDERS

Sudden changes in neurologic activity caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can often be detected on EEG. See Table 2.9-12 for common etiologies by age. Etiologies of seizures, and their distinguishing features, include the following:

TABLE 2.9-12. Causes of Seizure by Age Group

INFANTS CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS ADULTS ADULTS (<2 YEARS) (2-10YEARS) — (10-18 YEARS) (18-35YEARS) (>35 YEARS) Perinatal injury Idiopathic Idiopathic Trauma Trauma Infection Infection Trauma Alcoholism Stroke Metabolic Trauma Drug withdrawal Braintumor Metabolic disorders Genetic Febrile Arteriovenous mal- Alcoholism formations (AVMs) Brain tumor

Idiopathic epilepsy (recurrent, unprovoked seizures): May be caused by genetics, developmental factors, early life brain injuries, and so on.

Causes of acquired epilepsy:

Structural brain lesion (tumor, stroke, AVM hemorrhage, or developmental abnormality): tend to have focal onset or focal postictal deficit, suggesting focal CNS pathology.

Nonneurologic etiologies (ie, provoked seizures): Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hyperosmolar states, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, porphyria, drug overdose (cocaine, antidepressants, neuroleptics, methylxanthines, lidocaine), drug withdrawal (alcohol and other sedatives), eclampsia, hyperthermia, hypertensive encephalopathy, head trauma, and cerebral hypoperfusion.
======================================
CLASSIFICATION OF SEIZURE

A seizure is classified as partial (focal) or generalized (see Fig. 2.9-15).

KEY FACT

partial seizures may evolve

Both simple partial and complex partial seizures may evolve into secondary generalized seizures.

KEY FACT

Onn

Focal seizures can change into bilateral tonic-clonic type and may have associated loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.

KEY FACT

If an adult patient presents with an episode of lip smacking associated with an impaired level of consciousness and followed by confusion, think complex partial seizures.

KEY FACT

If a patient presents with uncontrollable twitching of their thumb and is fully aware of their symptoms, think simple partial seizures.
======================================
KEY FACT

If a patient presents with clonic movements associated with loss of consciousness and incontinence, think tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures.

History/PE Focal (partial): Abnormal electrical activity arises from a discrete region (or multiple discrete regions) of the brain. It can involve motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic features (eg, fear, déjà vu, hallucinations). Aura is common (auditory, visual, olfactory, or tactile hallucinations). Automatisms like lip smacking, picking, and swallowing are common. A postictal focal neurologic deficit (eg, hemiplegia/hemiparesis, or Todd paralysis) is possible and usually resolves within 24 hours. It can be simple or complex.

Aware: Previously called simple partial seizures. No impaired level of consciousness. Impaired awareness: Previously called complex partial seizures. Typically start on one side of the brain, often involving the temporal lobe (70%–80%) with bilateral spread of the aberrant electrical discharge, leading to impaired level of consciousness. Postictal confusion, disorientation, and amnesia are characteristic.

Generalized seizure: Seizure activity that involves both cerebral hemispheres, resulting in impaired level of consciousness. Classified as motor (tonic-clonic, other motor) or nonmotor (absence) type.

Tonic-clonic seizure: Sudden loss of consciousness with extension of the back and contraction of muscles (chest and extremities); repetitive, symmetric clonic (alternation between muscle contraction and relaxation) movements. Etiology often idiopathic. Simple and complex partial seizures may evolve into secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

Marked by incontinence and tongue biting. Patients may appear cyanotic during the ictal period. Postictal confusion and drowsiness. Muscle aches and headaches may also be present.

drowsiness. Muscle aches:and generalized seizure. Presents impaired consciousness can appear to be motion, lipssmacking, eyelid There is no before adulthood. It is

often unnoticeable episodes of impaired consciousness (petit mal seizures) occurring up to hundreds of times per day. Patient can appear to be daydreaming or staring. Symptoms may include sudden stops in motion, lip smacking, eyelid fluttering, and chewing motions. It can be triggered by hyperventilation. There is no postictal phase. Absence seizure begins in childhood and subsides before adulthood. It is often familial.

Unknown seizure: Generalized or focal. Often the beginning of seizure is not clear.

This patient presents with Broca or expressive aphasia. In Broca aphasia, the lesion is in the posterior frontal cortex of the dominant side of the brain. In this case, the lesion also involves the face and arm regions of the motor cortex, which are immediately adjacent to Broca area on the left hemisphere.

Diagnosis Clinical history by a bystander and physical examination are always clues to the diagnosis and differentiation among similarly appearing clinical symptoms. The history should look for brain trauma, infection, neoplasm, stroke, or developmental issues.

Best initial step: EEG. Brain MRI is considered for focal seizures. Focal seizure: Search for epileptogenic focus (CT or contrast MRI). Absence seizure: EEG shows three-per-second spike-and-wave discharges (remember

classic EEG findings, but do not worry about learning how to read them!). EEG changes can be triggered by hyperventilation.

Tonic-clonic seizure: EEG typically shows 10-Hz activity during the tonic phase and slow waves during the clonic phase (normal = pseudoseizures).
======================================
A

Serum prolactin levels may be elevated in the immediate postictal period of generalized and complex-partial seizures (vs pseudoseizures).

To rule out: Systemic causes with a CBC, electrolytes, calcium, fasting glucose, LFTs, a renal panel, ESR, and a toxicology screen.

Treatment Secure airway when appropriate. For acute seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes, see treatment of status epilepticus later in

chapter.

In cases of systemic secondary seizures, treat the underlying cause (eg, low blood sugar, alcohol withdrawal, or fever in children).

Anticonvulsants for partial and tonic-clonic seizures: levetiracetam, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid have similar efficacy and can be used as chronic monotherapy.

In children, levetiracetam is the first-line anticonvulsant. If fever is present, treat fever but also give lorazepam.

If a certain antiepileptic is ineffective as monotherapy, try an alternative. If the alternative is ineffective, try a regimen of multiple antiepileptics.

Other treatment options include gabapentin, topiramate, and oxcarbazepine. Absence seizure: First-line is ethosuximide; second-line is valproic acid.

Q

A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a single simple partial seizure of 1 minute but is no longer symptomatic. He also complains of 2 months of morning headaches and one episode of vomiting in the past week. What is the next step in management?

Intractable temporal lobe seizure: Consider anterior temporal lobectomy (epilepsy surgery) and/or vagal nerve stimulator.

Treatment is not necessary for a single episode of seizure.

STATUS EPILEPTICUS

A medical emergency consisting of prolonged seizures (usually >5 minutes) or two or more seizures that occur without a return to baseline consciousness within 30 minutes or continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity

Common causes include anticonvulsant withdrawal/noncompliance, anoxic brain injury, EtOH/sedative withdrawal or other drug intoxication, and metabolic disturbances (eg, hyponatremia), head trauma, and infection.

Mortality is 10% to 20%.

Diagnosis Treatment and diagnostic workup should be initiated simultaneously. Determination of the underlying cause should entail collateral history, physical exam, CBC, electrolytes, calcium, glucose, ABGs, LFTs, BUN/creatinine, ESR, antiepileptic drug levels, and a toxicology screen.

Continuous EEG monitoring is indicated if nonconvulsive status epilepticus is suspected or if patient is not waking up after clinically obvious seizures stop.

If intracranial pathology is suspected, the physician should obtain a stat head CT. An LP should be procured in the setting of fever or meningeal signs, but only after a CT

scan has been obtained to assess the safety of the LP.

Although status epilepticus is traditionally defined as seizures lasting >5 minutes, treatment should begin for any seizure lasting >5 minutes to prevent brain-induced cardiac, pulmonary, and other complications.

Treatment Best initial step: Like in all emergencies, treatment starts with the ABCs. During the

stabilization phase, the following interventions usually occur simultaneously:

Stabilization of the airway for breathing and circulation Check of oxygen saturation and use of supplemental oxygen or consideration of

intubation

Connection of ECG monitor Determination of capillary blood glucose reading and treatment if it is less than 60

mg/dL

collect blood for anticonvulsant levels*(if already are given to IV\benzodiazepines) persists after 5 minutes

Procurement of IV access to collect blood for electrolytes, hematologic workup, toxicology screen, and anticonvulsant levels (if already on medications)

Best initial therapy: Benzodiazepines are given intravascularly: IV lorazepam or IV diazepam. These steps (from ABCs to IV benzodiazepines) are carried out between 5 and 20 minutes of resuscitation:

This is given if the seizure persists after 5 minutes (ie, the stabilization phase) or recurs when the patient is being treated.

Alternatives include phenobarbital, rectal diazepam for children, and intranasal midazolam.

Next step in management: If seizure persists despite these treatments, the physician should consider IV fosphenytoin, IV valproic acid, or IV levetiracetam.

Last-resort options include repetition of second-line drugs or induction of coma by use of general anesthetics (eg, propofol).

MNEMONIC

Withdrawal from ABBA can cause seizures— Alcohol Benzodiazepines Barbiturates Anticonvulsants

A

The next step in management is to order a CT of the brain because the history is suggestive of a brain tumor and the patient is no longer symptomatic. If seizures recur, consider beginning anticonvulsant therapy.

VERTIGO

Before discussing conditions that cause vertigo, it is worth defining vertigo and differentiating it from lightheadedness. “Dizziness” is often used to describe vertigo and lightheadedness. Vertigo feels as if one or one’s surroundings are moving when there is no actual movement. Lightheadedness feels as if one is about to faint or “pass out.” Conscious sensation of vertigo occurs in the cerebral cortex as a result of an error signal of observed over expected from the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear and brainstem, or in response to imbalances in vestibular input between left and right sides.

lesions in the CNS. Common characteristics include severe postural and gait instability, purely vertical or purely torsional nystagmus, and other focal neurologic signs. Peripheral vertigo is caused by lesions in the inner ear. Common characteristics include deafness, tinnitus, horizontal torsional nystagmus, and absent focal neurologic signs.
======================================
BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO

POSITIONAL vertigo resulting in the semicircular The posterior canal vertigo (lasting <1

A common cause of recurrent peripheral vertigo resulting from displacement of otoliths (“ear stones”), which lead to disturbances in the semicircular canals—the parts of the ear responsible for detecting head rotation. The posterior canal is the most common site.

History/PE Patients present with transient, episodic vertigo (lasting <1 minute) and nystagmus triggered by changes in head position (eg, while turning in bed, getting in and out of bed, or reaching overhead). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

KEY FACT

Progressive bilateral (high-frequency) sensorineural hearing loss and occasional tinnitus are normal (presbycusis). They are typically noticed by 60 years of age.

Diagnosis Dix-Hallpike maneuver (used primarily to identify posterior canal BPPV): The patient

should turn their head 45 degrees right or left and go from a sitting to a supine position. If vertigo and the typical nystagmus (rotatory nystagmus with the fast phase toward the affected side) are reproduced, BPPV is the likely diagnosis. If positive, the test should be repeated. In BPPV, the vertigo fatigues with the second attempt due to washout of the otoconia.

Nystagmus that persists for >1 minute, is not suppressed by visual fixation, and lacks fatigability along with gait disturbance should raise concern for a central lesion.

Treatment Epley maneuver (an extended version of the Dix-Hallpike maneuver used as treatment)

resolves 85% of cases.

BPPV usually subsides spontaneously in weeks to months, but up to 30% recur within 1 to 3 years. Long-term use of antivertigo medications (eg, meclizine) are generally contraindicated, as they have limited efficacy, they are sedating, and they inhibit vestibular compensation, which may lead to chronic unsteadiness.

ACUTE PERIPHERAL VESTIBULOPATHY (LABYRINTHITIS OR VESTIBULAR NEURITIS)

History/PE Presents with acute onset of severe vertigo, head motion intolerance, and gait unsteadiness

Presents with acute onset of severe vertigo, head motion intolerance, and gait unsteadiness accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus. Often preceded by viral infection.

accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus. Often preceded by viral infection. Labyrinthitis: Inflammation of the labyrinth, which contains organs of both hearing and equilibrium. Auditory or aural symptoms (tinnitus, ear fullness, or hearing loss) present. Lateral pontine/cerebellar stroke (anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory) may present with similar symptoms but may have additional occipital headache, ataxia, nystagmus, and somatosensory deficits (supplies spinal tract of CN V and spinothalamic tract).

Vestibular neuritis: Inflammation of the vestibular nerve, responsible for balance and equilibrium. Lacks auditory or aural symptoms. Lateral medullary/cerebellar stroke (posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory) can present with similar symptoms, but patients have focal findings on exam (ie, ataxia, sensory loss, dysphagia, Horner syndrome).

aural symptoms. Lateral territory) can present exam (ie, ataxia, sensory
======================================
KEY FACT

If a patient complains of vertigo and vomiting without hearing loss for 1 week after having been diagnosed with a viral infection, think acute vestibular neuritis.

Diagnosis A diagnosis of exclusion once the more serious causes of vertigo (eg, cerebellar/brainstem stroke) have been ruled out. Acute peripheral vestibulopathy presents with vertigo over minutes to hours, but the onset of vertigo due to a vascular event is more hyperacute.

Acute peripheral vestibulopathy demonstrates the following:

An abnormal vestibulo-ocular reflex, as determined by a bedside head impulse test (ie, patient not able to maintain visual fixation during rapid head rotation toward side of the lesion, followed by a compensatory saccade once the head stops moving)

A predominantly horizontal nystagmus that always beats in one direction, towards the opposite side of the lesion

No vertical eye misalignment by alternate cover testing

If patients are “high risk” (ie, atypical eye findings or neurologic symptoms or signs; cannot stand independently; have a new-onset headache, head, or neck pain; are >50 years of age; or have one or more stroke risk factors), MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging and MRA are indicated.

Treatment

Acute treatment consists of corticosteroids given <72 hours after symptom onset, antivertigo agents (eg, meclizine), and antiemetics. The condition usually subsides spontaneously within weeks to months.

MÉNIÈRE DISEASE

A cause of recurrent vertigo with unilateral auditory symptoms that affects at least 1 in 500 individuals in the United States. More common among women. This disorder of the inner ear is characterized by ↑ volume of endolymph (endolymphatic hydrops).

History/PE Presents with the classic tetrad of episodic vertigo, tinnitus, aural fullness, and hearing loss. Episodes often last minutes to hours. Nausea and vomiting are typical. Patients progressively lose low-frequency hearing over years and may become deaf on the affected side.

Diagnosis Usually clinical. Based on the following:

Two episodes lasting ≥20 minutes with remission of symptoms between episodes Hearing loss documented at least once with audiometry Tinnitus or aural fullness

helpful to rule out other to control spinning

MRI of the temporal bone often helpful to rule out other causes that present similarly (eg, tumors, aneurysms, multiple sclerosis)

Treatment Acute: Meclizine or benzodiazepines to control spinning sensation during acute attacks;

antiemetics for nausea/vomiting.

Chronic: Dietary/lifestyle changes that limit salt, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol intake to avoid fluid retention. Betahistine (vasodilator that improves circulation in the inner ear) or diuretics can be used for patients with refractory symptoms not amenable to lifestyle changes.

For severe unilateral cases, intratympanic injection of gentamicin into the middle ear (absorbed by the inner ear) is shown to reduce the frequency and severity of vertigo attacks.
======================================
KEY FACT

The incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type B meningitis has greatly ↓ over the past 10 to 15 years as a result of routine vaccination.

KEY FACT

A petechial or purpuric rash is characteristic of meningococcal meningitis. Waterhouse- Friderichsen syndrome (acute adrenal insufficiency caused by adrenal gland hemorrhage) is characterized by profound hypotension and has a high mortality.

CNS INFECTIONS

MENINGITIS

Acute bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening emergency. Viral (also called “aseptic”) meningitis is more common and clinically less morbid. Risk factors for meningitis include recent ear infection, sinusitis, immunodeficiencies, recent neurosurgical procedures, crowded living conditions (ie, college dorms, military), and sick contacts. Commonly encountered causative organisms are listed in Table 2.9-13.

Diagnosis Best initial test: An LP for CSF analysis, Gram stain, and culture, ideally before initiation of antibiotics and procurement of glucose, protein, WBC count plus differential, RBC count, and opening pressure (in the absence of papilledema or focal neurologic deficits) information.

Viral polymerase chain reactions ([PCRs]; eg, herpes simplex virus [HSV]); cryptococcal antigen (for HIV patients).

CT or MRI indicated in a minority of patients before LP, in particular those with altered mental status, papilledema, or focal neurologic deficits to exclude a mass lesion or ↑ ICP. If CT is being obtained, empiric antibiotics should be started beforehand. Obtain blood cultures. CBC may reveal leukocytosis. CSF findings vary (see Table 2.9-14).

KEY FACT

The CSF antigen test for cryptococcal meningitis is highly sensitive and specific.

Q

A 19-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department from her dorm room, where she was found by her roommate in a confused state. She complains of fever, nausea, vomiting, and pain in her neck and head. She has a petechial rash on her legs. CSF examination reveals a glucose level of 22 mg/dL, a protein level of 140 mg/dL, and a WBC count of 1400/mm3. What is the most likely organism responsible for her condition?

with fever, headache, altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits.

Diagnosis Serology, PCR (indicates exposure and risk for reactivation), and occasionally tissue exam

for histology.

In the setting of CNS involvement, CT scan (toxoplasmosis indicated by multiple isodense or hypodense ring-enhancing mass lesions) or an MRI (has a predilection for the basal ganglia; more sensitive).

Treatment Most accurate treatment: Induction with high-dose PO pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine and leucovorin (a folic acid analog to prevent hematologic toxicity) for 4 to 8 weeks; maintenance with a low-dose regimen until the disease has resolved clinically and radiographically

Use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ([TMP-SMX], eg, Bactrim DS) or pyrimethamine + dapsone for prophylaxis in patients with a CD4+ cell count <100/mm3 and a ⊕ toxoplasmosis IgG
======================================
KEY FACT

Ring-enhancing lesions in patients with AIDS should always prompt consideration of toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphoma.

KEY FACT

The presence of RBCs in CSF (pink-colored CSF) without a history of trauma is highly suggestive of HSV encephalitis.

ENCEPHALITIS

HSV and arboviruses are the most common causes of encephalitis. Rarer etiologies include CMV, toxoplasmosis, West Nile virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Borrelia, Rickettsia, Legionella, enterovirus, Mycoplasma, and cerebral malaria. Children and older adults are the most vulnerable.

History/PE Altered consciousness, headache, fever, seizures. Lethargy, confusion, coma, focal neurological deficits may also be present. Differentials include brain abscess, malignancy, SDH, SAH, toxic-metabolic

encephalopathy.

KEY FACT

meningitis abscess encephalitis

CNS infections key words: Photophobia, nuchal rigidity = meningitis Focal neurologic deficits = brain abscess Confusion, altered mental status = encephalitis

Diagnosis The physician should procure a CT immediately to rule out other life-threatening

conditions that cause neurologic symptoms and may demonstrate characteristic temporal lobe signal abnormalities in HSV encephalitis (see Fig. 2.9-17).

FIGURE 2.9-17. HSV encephalitis. Coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image of a young man with HSV encephalitis shows the characteristic MRI pattern within the cortex of the right temporal lobe (circle). The left temporal lobe is also involved (arrow), but to a lesser extent. (Reproduced with permission from Fauci AS et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 17th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis and moderately ↑ protein. The glucose level is low in tuberculous, fungal, bacterial, and amebic infections.

Perform CSF Gram stain (bacteria); acid-fast stain (mycobacteria); India ink stain (Cryptococcus); cultures for all organism types; and PCR for HSV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), VZV, and enterovirus. Obtain West Nile IgM serologies and consider a wet preparation (free-living amebae) and a Giemsa stain (trypanosomes) if the history is suggestive.

Neisseria meningitidis is the most likely organism responsible for her condition. The physician should suspect meningococcal meningitis in a very ill patient with fever, headache, altered mental status, a petechial rash in the lower extremities, and a CSF profile indicative of bacterial meningitis.

BRAIN ABSCESS

A focal suppurative infection of the brain parenchyma, usually with a “ring-enhancing” appearance caused by a fibrous capsule (see Fig. 2.9-18). The most common pathogens are Streptococci, Staphylococci, and anaerobes; 80% to 90% are polymicrobial. Nonbacterial causes include Toxoplasma and Candida; Aspergillus and zygomycosis should be considered in immunocompromised hosts, and neurocysticercosis should be considered in relevant epidemiologic settings (Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia). Modes of transmission include the following:

A

FIGURE 2.9-18. Brain abscess. Postcontrast MRI of the brain shows ring-enhancing lesions in the lateral right frontal lobe, with “daughter” lesions (smaller adjacent rings of enhancement) also noted. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Direct spread (25–50% of cases): Caused by paranasal sinusitis (frequently affects young men and is often caused by Streptococcus milleri [of the α-hemolytic viridans streptococcus]), otitis media, mastoiditis, or dental infection

Direct inoculation: History of head trauma or neurosurgical procedures Hematogenous spread (25% of cases): Often shows an MCA distribution with multiple

trauma or cases): Often shows and located at the inattention, confusion, increasing ICP and focal

abscesses that are poorly encapsulated and located at the gray-white junction

History/PE Headache (most common), drowsiness, inattention, confusion, and seizures are early symptoms, followed by signs of increasing ICP and focal neurologic deficits.

KEY FACT

The classic clinical triad of headache, fever, and a focal neurologic deficit is present in 50% of cases of brain abscess.

Diagnosis CT scan will show a ring-enhancing lesion with a low-density core. Most accurate test: MRI has a higher sensitivity for early abscesses and posterior fossa

lesions.

CSF analysis is not necessary and may precipitate brainstem herniation. Lab values may show peripheral leukocytosis, ↑ ESR, and ↑ C-reactive protein (CRP).

Treatment IV antibiotics: Metronidazole + a third-generation cephalosporin ± vancomycin for 6 to 8 weeks. The physician should obtain serial CT/MRIs to follow resolution. Lesions <2 cm can often be treated medically.

Surgical drainage (aspiration or excision) may be necessary for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.

Dexamethasone with taper may be used in severe cases to ↓ cerebral edema; IV mannitol

may be used to ↓ ICP. Prophylactic anticonvulsants should be given.
======================================
KEY FACT

In general, LP is contraindicated for a patient with a mass lesion in the brain because of the potential but life-threatening risk for uncal or cerebellar herniation.

DISORDERS OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder caused by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies. These autoantibodies bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic neuromuscular membrane, which results in a fatiguing muscular weakness syndrome with a sex-specific age distribution (women aged 20– 30 years; men aged 60–80 years). Seventy-five percent of patients have thymic disease (85% thymic hyperplasia; 15% thymoma; Fig. 2.9-19).

FIGURE 2.9-19. CT image of an encapsulated thymoma (arrow) in a 61-year-old female with myasthenia gravis set to undergo surgical resection. (Reproduced with permission from Lee JH, Park CM, Park SJ, et al. Value of computerized 3D shape analysis in differentiating encapsulated from invasive thymomas. PLoS One. 2015;10[5]:e0126175. Published 2015 May 4. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0126175.)

History/PE Hallmark: Muscle fatigability. Small, often-used muscles (eyelid, jaw muscles) are more

sensitive to AChR-Ab interference, which results in ocular symptoms (most common initially: ptosis, diplopia), facial weakness, bulbar symptoms (chewing fatigue, dysphagia,

dysarthria), and upper/lower extremity muscle weakness notably worse at the end of the day and with sustained activity.

Other distinguishing features: Absence of autonomic symptoms (only a neuromuscular junction disorder) along with normal pupillary responses, sensations, and deep tendon reflexes. Progressive muscle weakness occurs with increased use. See Table 2.9-16.

it can lead to respiratory distress and airway obstruction due to respiratory and bulbar muscle fatigue, respectively. Precipitating factors include infection (most common), surgery, and drugs. Notably, antibiotics (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones), hydroxychloroquine, and β-blockers can precipitate crisis and/or worsen symptoms. Avoid if possible.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies (AChR-Ab). If seronegative for AChR-Ab and symptoms suggest MG, the case calls for muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) autoantibodies.

Most accurate test: Electromyography (EMG). It shows muscle fatigability with a decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation. This occurs as endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) stores are depleted and AChR-Ab outcompete endogenous ACh for nicotinic receptors.

Best initial imaging test: Contrast CT or MRI of the chest to evaluate the anterior mediastinum for thymic disease.

Bedside tests: Application of ice for 1 to 2 minutes on the eyelid to relieve ptosis by decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity and increasing endogenous ACh in the synapse. Edrophonium is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase antagonist that raises endogenous ACh in the synapse to briefly improve motor symptoms.

Chronic drug therapies: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (best initial treatment; pyridostigmine) ± glycopyrrolate (antimuscarinic drug used to control autonomic side effects of anticholinesterase treatment). Most need immunotherapy initially with steroids, followed by a transition to nonsteroidal immunosuppressants such as azathioprine.

Anticholinesterase drug toxicity: Because patients with MG lack autonomic symptoms, alertness is required for patients presenting with widespread cholinergic activation.

Surgery: Thymectomy indicated for all patients with thymomas and for all patients <60 years of age with mild to moderate disease.

LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder caused by voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) autoantibodies. These autoantibodies bind to VGCCs on the presynaptic neuromuscular membrane and other presynaptic terminals located throughout the autonomic nervous system → ↓ ACh release. This results in a muscular weakness syndrome with autonomic dysfunction. It can occur as a non-paraneoplastic syndrome or a paraneoplastic syndrome (more common) that is classically associated with small cell lung carcinoma (62% of cases).
======================================
KEY FACT

Repetitive nerve stimulation reveals a characteristic incremental response in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle usability) but shows a decremental response in myasthenia gravis (muscle fatigability).

History/PE Hallmark: Muscle usability. LEMS is characterized by slow-onset proximal muscle weakness (difficulty rising from chair, walking, combing hair, reaching upward on shelves) that is distinguished from myositis as creatine kinase (CK) levels are normal and myalgia is absent. The symptoms of LEMS improve with activity (muscle usability) as repeated depolarizations of presynaptic terminals help overcome the autoantibody blockade of presynaptic VGCCs.

presynaptic VGCCs impair Ach release in the neuromuscular junction and throughout the autonomic nervous system. This results in autonomic dysfunction, including xerostomia, erectile dysfunction, constipation, and impaired pupillary light response. Initial deep tendon reflexes are diminished/absent but increase with repeated testing due to “muscle usability.”

Diagnosis Best initial test: Anti-P/Q–type VGCC autoantibodies. Most accurate test: EMG. Shows muscle usability with an incremental response to

VGCC autoantibodies. muscle usability with repeated depolarizations of presynaptic MRI facilitates evaluation (contrast CT chest).

repetitive nerve stimulation as repeated depolarizations of presynaptic terminals helps overcome the autoantibody blockade of presynaptic VGCCs.

Best initial imaging test: CT or MRI facilitates evaluation for underlying malignancy, classically small cell lung cancer (contrast CT chest).

carcinoma).

Amifampridine (3,4-diaminopyridine [3,4-DAP]) or guanidine. Both ↓ potassium efflux from presynaptic neurons → prolonged depolarization → ↑ ACh release. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine) are also used to ↑ ACh.

IVIG followed by oral immunosuppressive agents if persistent disease despite medical therapy and treatment of underlying malignancy.
======================================
KEY FACT

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome presents with proximal muscle weakness that briefly improves with use, initially diminished/absent reflexes that improve with testing, and autonomic dysfunction—classically in a patient with a lung mass on imaging.

BOTULISM

Symmetric descending paralysis caused by ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores or exposure to spores in soil of endemic regions (California, Utah). Disease calls for IV

botulism IG and respiratory support. Consider in any infant with bulbar palsies, ptosis, constipation, or hypotonia. Avoid honey to prevent exposure in young infants (see Table 2.9- 17).

DISORDERS demyelinating disorder of the female-to-male ratio

DEMYELINATING DISORDERS

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disorder of the CNS of unclear etiology, but it is thought to be immune mediated. The female-to-male ratio is 2:1, and it is typically diagnosed between 20 and 40 years of age. MS becomes more common with increasing distance from the equator during childhood and in patients with a history of autoimmune disease. MS has been associated with the HLA-DRB1 locus. Subtypes are relapsing remitting (most common), primary progressive, secondary progressive, and progressive relapsing.

History/PE Multiple neurologic complaints that are separate in time and space and are not explained

by a single lesion. As the disease progresses, permanent deficits accumulate.

Bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia caused by bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lesions is classic for MS.

Limb weakness, gait unsteadiness, paresthesias, Lhermitte sign (electric shock sensation that radiates down the spine or limbs), blurry vision, vertigo, nystagmus, urinary retention, sexual and bowel dysfunction, depression, and cognitive impairment are also seen. Symptoms classically worsen transiently with hot showers.

Attacks are unpredictable but on average occur every 1.5 years, lasting for 2 to 8 weeks. Neurologic symptoms can come and go or be progressive. Those with a relapsing and

remitting history have the best prognosis.
======================================
KEY FACT

Pregnancy may be associated with a ↓ in MS symptoms, but this comes with increased risk of exacerbation postpartum.

Diagnosis Thorough history and physical examination are important. Most accurate tests: Use MRI and LP for definitive diagnosis. MRI (diagnostic test of choice for MS) shows multiple asymmetric, often periventricular, white matter lesions (Dawson fingers), especially in the corpus callosum. Active lesions are enhanced with gadolinium.

CSF reveals ↑ IgG index or at least two oligoclonal bands not found in the serum (nonspecific).

LP is only indicated for atypical cases where the diagnosis is unclear clinically and by MRI.

Treatment Acute exacerbations: High-dose IV corticosteroids. Plasma exchange in patients who do

not respond to corticosteroids

Disease-modifying medications: Natalizumab and ocrelizumab are highly effective in patients who haven’t responded to other therapies. Risk of PML with natalizumab. Patients with less active disease can be started on oral medications, such as dimethyl fumarate or fingolimod. Beta-interferon therapy and glatiramer have the highest safety profiles but decreased effectiveness.

therapy baclofen for spasticity, incontinence, carbamazepine for clinical depression.

Symptomatic therapy includes baclofen for spasticity, cholinergics for urinary retention, anticholinergics for urinary incontinence, carbamazepine or amitriptyline for painful paresthesias, and antidepressants for clinical depression.

GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME

An acute, rapidly progressive demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the peripheral and cranial nerves that results in weakness. Associated with recent Campylobacter jejuni infection, viral infection, or influenza vaccine (in extremely rare cases). This preceding infection triggers an autoimmune response against the myelin or axon of peripheral nerves. Approximately 85% of patients make a complete or near-complete recovery (may take up to 1 year). The most common type is called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Another subtype is Miller Fisher syndrome, characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and absent reflexes.

The 4 As of Guillain-Barré syndrome— Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy Ascending paralysis Autonomic neuropathy Albuminocytologic dissociation (increased albumin in CSF)

History/PE

Classically presents with progressive (hours to days), symmetric, ascending paralysis (distal to proximal) and areflexia. Paralysis can progress to involve the trunk, diaphragm, and cranial nerves. Twenty-five percent of patients experience respiratory failure and may require intubation.

Autonomic and sensory nerves may also be affected, leading to glove-and-stocking distribution paresthesias and autonomic dysregulation (eg, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, arrhythmias).

Increased risk of hyponatremia (poor prognostic factor).

Diagnosis Evidence of diffuse demyelination is seen on nerve conduction studies, which show ↓

nerve conduction velocity.

Diagnosis is supported by an elevated CSF protein level >55 mg/dL and normal WBC count (albuminocytologic dissociation).

KEY FACT

Remember that ascending paralysis with normal CSF findings and without autonomic dysfunction is characteristic of tick-borne paralysis, not Guillain-Barré syndrome.

negative inspiratory should be admitted to the first-line. Corticosteroids is imperative.

Treatment Frequent monitoring of maximal negative inspiratory force (NIF) and vital capacity can determine whether the patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for impending respiratory failure.

Plasmapheresis and IVIG are first-line. Corticosteroids are not indicated. Aggressive physical rehabilitation is imperative.

NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS

Neurodegenerative disorders commonly present with cognitive complaints. Early on, it can be difficult to determine whether this is due to normal aging or mild or major neurocognitive impairment (see Table 2.9-18).

DEMENTIA

Dementias are progressive, chronic diseases characterized by the continuous degeneration of neurons. So focus on the onset of early presenting features to diagnose them in vignettes, as middle-to-late findings can overlap. Table 2.9-19 and the sections that follow contrast the time course, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of common types of dementia.

KEY FACT

In HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) can occur in HIV/AIDS patients regardless of HIV treatment status. HAND is partly caused by HIV-infected microglia in the

CNS. Dx: Diagnosis of exclusion; early findings include mild cognitive impairment that can progress to HIV-associated dementia. Tx: antiretroviral therapy; avoid efavirenz due to CNS side effects.

ALZHEIMER DISEASE

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease that represents the most common cause of dementia (66%). Degeneration of cholinergic circuits → diffuse atrophy of cortex + subcortex (hippocampus = hallmark of recent memory impairment). Age is the most important risk factor for sporadic AD, as 95% of patients present at age >65. The apolipoprotein E gene can be harmful or protective (ε4 allele → amyloid precursor protein [APP] → promotes formation of amyloid β [pathologic]). ε2 allele → APP → promotes formation of amyloid α (nonpathologic). ↑ number = ↑ risk. Early-onset AD (5% cases, <65 years of age) is familial (APP + presenilin 1,2 gene mutations) and associated with Down syndrome (APP on chromosome 21).

History/PE Neurocognitive dysfunction: Degeneration of cholinergic circuits to hippocampus →

declarative episodic recent memory impairment = earliest, most important clinical finding. Continued degeneration of cortex + subcortex → progressive memory impairments (eg, long-term memories) later in the disease. Other early-to-intermediate findings include executive dysfunction with judgment/problem solving (poor work performance) + visuospatial impairments (getting lost in familiar places) + language deficits (naming, comprehension, fluency). Other cognitive domains = intermediate-to-late findings.

disease. judgment/problem solving lost in familiar places) cognitive domains = to late in the course socially disengaged, incontinence +

Behavioral + psychiatric: Middle to late in the course of AD. Patients exhibit personality changes and can become apathetic, socially disengaged, irritable, aggressive, and psychotic.

Incontinence + motor: Bowel/bladder incontinence + motor dysfunction (eg, apraxia for learned motor tasks) are not present in the early-to-intermediate course of AD (mainly late findings).
======================================
MNEMONIC

Symptom onset distinguishes AD from normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): Alzheimer (DUM): Dementia (early, short-term memory) > Urinary incontinence > Motor NPH (MUD): Motor (early, gait ataxia) > Urinary incontinence > Dementia

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis:

Imaging: MRI/CT reveals diffuse cortical (especially temporal/parietal lobes) + hippocampal atrophy → hydrocephalus ex vacuo

Pathologic examination reveals extracellular neuritic plaques (amyloid β entrapping neuritic processes → cerebral amyloid angiopathy → lobar hemorrhage) + intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (hyperphosphorylated tau proteins) + intracellular Hirano bodies (rod-shaped aggregates actin/associated proteins, especially in hippocampus)

Treatment Best first-line treatment of mild to moderate AD: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

Degeneration of cholinergic neurons → widespread cholinergic deficiency → treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) → modest improvement in cognitive + global functioning. No evidence for altering disease progression. Adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, and insomnia, among other cholinergic side effects.

Avoid anticholinergic medications! Vitamin E can be supplemented for its antioxidant role in mild to moderate dementia. Although evidence is inconclusive, it is often prescribed due to its good safety profile. Moderate to severe AD → add memantine → N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist → ↓ glutamate excitotoxicity → neuroprotective → modifies progressive symptomatic decline. Adverse effects include dizziness, confusion, and hallucinations.

VASCULAR DEMENTIA

Dementia associated with a history of stroke and cerebrovascular disease. Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia.

History/PE Stepwise decline in cognitive ability, with impaired executive function often preceding

memory deficits

and a history of stroke

KEY FACT

If a patient shows abrupt changes in symptoms (especially motor symptoms) over time rather than a steady decline, think vascular dementia.

Diagnosis The diagnosis is made when there is dementia or mild cognitive impairment and all of the following:

Cerebrovascular disease as evidenced by history/PE or neuroimaging Clinical course that is abrupt, stepwise, or related to stroke Symptoms not better explained by other disorders such as progressive nonvascular

dementia

Treatment Protocols for the prevention and treatment of vascular dementia are the same as those for stroke, including treatment of risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA (PICK DISEASE)

A rare progressive, irreversible neurodegeneration of mainly the frontal and/or temporal lobes. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) manifests as early-onset dementia (50s to 60s) and encompasses a spectrum of subtypes that present with predominately frontal lobe (Pick personality/behavioral changes/possibly motor) and/or temporal lobe (aphasia) features.

History/PE Behavioral variant FTD (most common) is characterized by early progressive changes in behavior that represent a dramatic, persistent shift in predisease personality. Representing degeneration of the frontal cortex, presentations include disinhibition, socially inappropriate behavior, apathy, loss of empathy/sympathy, hyperorality (binge eating, putting objects in mouth), compulsive behaviors, and depending on subtype/locations of degeneration, motor symptoms.

Primary progressive aphasia represents an aphasia subtype of FTD that presents with an insidious onset and gradual progression of speech/language impairment such as speech apraxia ± word finding/usage/comprehension difficulties. Early in the disease, other cognitive domains remain intact.

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis Imaging:

MRI reveals unilateral or bilateral frontal and/or temporal lobe atrophy → hydrocephalus ex vacuo

hypoperfusion + neuronal intracellular (spherical [round]

FDG-PET reveals frontotemporal hypoperfusion + hypometabolism

Pathologic examination reveals neuronal intracellular accumulations of ubiquitinated TDP-43 proteins ± Pick bodies (spherical [round] aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins)

Treatment No disease-modifying therapies exist. Supportive care only (eg, for depression, agitation, insomnia).
======================================
NORMAL-PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS

A relatively rare, potentially reversible form of dementia that arises in adults age >60. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a form of chronic communicating hydrocephalus: ↓ CSF absorption → ↑ CSF → enlargement of ventricles → lateral ventricles expand → stretching of the corona radiata → gait ataxia (early, altered corticospinal tract) + urinary urgency/frequency/incontinence (loss detrusor inhibition) + dementia. NPH can be idiopathic or arise secondarily from damage to the arachnoid granulations (impairs CSF absorption) triggered by inflammatory (meningitis) and hemorrhage-induced (intraventricular/subarachnoid) causes.

Q

A 71-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician’s office by her son, who is concerned that she has had worsening recent memory, difficulty participating in her daily activities, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping for the past year. She scores a 22 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). What is the most likely diagnosis?

History/PE Pressures: NPH is characterized by a normal opening pressure on LP. Continuous ICP monitoring in studies shows normal or episodically ↑ ICP. As such, NPH is a form of hydrocephalus that occurs in the absence of diffusely ↑ ICP symptoms (papilledema, headaches, nausea/vomiting, vision loss). The ↑ CSF in NPH causes regional, not diffuse, ↑ ICP via the stretching of the lateral ventricles → stretching of the corona radiata → classic triad of gait ataxia (wobbly), urinary incontinence (wet), and dementia (wacky).

Gait ataxia (wobbly) is an early hallmark sign. The magnetic gait is like the shuffling gait seen with Parkinson disease (PD) (slow, wide based). It is distinguished by arm swing preservation + lack of other motor findings (tremor).

Urinary incontinence (wet). Early in disease, urinary urgency/frequency is more common. Later in disease, urinary incontinence is more common and is accompanied by apathy.

Dementia (wacky) evolves over months to years after gait dysfunction with psychomotor delay, decreased concentration/attention, executive dysfunction, and apathy.

Diagnosis Clinical: Patients do not need to have the complete triad of gait ataxia, urinary

incontinence, and dementia.

Gait dysfunction is key, as it can be the only symptom and must be present for the diagnosis. The physician should establish the presence of urinary urgency/frequency/incontinence via history and dementia via cognitive testing.

establish the presence via history and dementia CT and shows.ventriculomegaly Fig. 2.9-20).

Best initial imaging test: MRI > CT and shows ventriculomegaly without cortical atrophy = without sulcal enlargement (see Fig. 2.9-20).

FIGURE 2.9-20. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. T2-weighted MRI from a 60-year-old woman with early gait ataxia, slowly developing urinary incontinence, and dementia shows marked dilation of the lateral ventricles (red arrow). This is out of proportion to the sulcal enlargement (ie, without sulcal enlargement) (yellow arrow). (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Best confirmatory test: Improvement of symptoms following LP (opening pressure is normal/slightly ↑).
======================================
KEY FACT

Classic triad of NPH in order of onset = “Wobbly (gait ataxia), Wet (urgency/incontinence), and Wacky (dementia).”

Treatment Definitive treatment: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting. A lumbar drainage trial, over the course of 2 to 7 days, can be used to determine potential response to VP shunting. Predominant gait symptoms indicate a favorable surgical response, while the presence of moderate to severe dementia does not.

CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE

Although it is the most common prion disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) remains an extremely rare form of dementia. CJD occurs when an abnormal protease-resistant prion protein accumulates in the brain, causing spongy degeneration, neuronal loss, and astrocytic proliferation.

with ataxia and/or noted weeks to months disease) is’a more slowly eating contaminated

History/PE CJD causes a subacute dementia with ataxia and/or startle-induced myoclonic jerks, with

rapid clinical progression that is noted weeks to months after symptom onset.

New-variant CJD (mad cow disease) is a more slowly progressive prion disease seen in younger people with a history of eating contaminated beef or contaminated human brains (kuru).

Iatrogenic CJD can be seen after ophthalmologic or neurosurgical procedures such as corneal transplant due to poor equipment sterilization.

KEY FACT

CJD’s rapid progression and presence of myoclonus distinguish it from other dementias.

Alzheimer disease is the likely diagnosis. The key differences between Alzheimer disease and normal aging are that in normal aging, patients can perform their activities of daily living, complain of memory loss yet provide detailed information about their forgetfulness, and have a score >27 on the MMSE.

protein misfolding within CSF samples.

Brain MRI may show hyperintensity in the caudate and putamen (“hockey stick sign”) or a cortical ribboning pattern.

Differential diagnosis includes paraneoplastic syndromes, drug induced, and autoimmune encephalitis. Probable diagnosis of CJD is made when there is a rapid progression of symptoms with no other cause identified by MRI, EEG, or CSF samples, plus corroborating findings as listed in this section.

Treatment Symptomatic management. Most patients die within 1 year of symptom onset as there is no cure and progression cannot be halted.

LEWY BODY DEMENTIA

Lewy body dementia is an umbrella term for PD (Lewy body) dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)—distinguished by the 1-year rule (see Diagnosis). DLB is the second most common cause of dementia (10%–20% of cases) and classically presents in patients age >65 and classically presents in patients age >65 with associated depression and suicidality.

History/PE Classic triad of dementia + parkinsonism + visual “hallewynations.”

+ executive and visuospatial motor symptoms = TRAP instability): +detailed (animals, arousal, and attention

Dementia is characterized by executive and visuospatial dysfunction. Parkinsonism = extrapyramidal motor symptoms = TRAP (Tremor, Rigidity,

Akinesia/bradykinesia, Postural instability).

Visual hallucinations are well-formed + detailed (animals, people, abstract shapes/colors). Fluctuations are present in cognition, arousal, and attention (range from baseline to brief

decline to strokelike).

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder → recurrent dream-related vocalizations/motor behaviors.

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis. One-year rule distinguishes PD dementia from DLB:

DLB is diagnosed when cognitive impairment occurs with parkinsonism or within <1 year before parkinsonism.

Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) is diagnosed when cognitive impairment occurs >1 year after parkinsonism.

Imaging: MRI can show cortical atrophy with limited hippocampal atrophy (vs AD). Pathology: PD, PDD, and Lewy body dementia all have round, eosinophilic inclusions of α-synuclein (Lewy bodies) on pathologic examination and represent a disease spectrum. Inclusions are found in cortical cells (Lewy body dementia) and basal ganglia (PD, PDD).
======================================
Treatment Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for dementia: Donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine.

Only used in AD + Lewy body dementias

Parkinsonian symptoms: Similar to PD treatment with an emphasis on lower doses/slower titration to avoid exacerbating psychotic symptoms and hallucinations via ↑

dopamine

MOVEMENT DISORDERS

HUNTINGTON DISEASE

An autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by excessive trinucleotide (CAG) repeats on chromosome 4 during spermatogenesis → abnormally long huntingtin protein → glutamate excitotoxicity via the NMDA-R→ degeneration of cerebrum + striatum (caudate + putamen) → loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/ACh, unbalanced dopamine (DA) activity → triad of motor (chorea), memory (executive dysfunction), and mood (irritability) symptoms. Huntington disease (HD) is slowly progressive, with only symptomatic treatments, and results in death in 10 to 20 years.

History/PE Typically presents at 30 to 50 years of age with a family history that is indicative of anticipation (worsening/earlier symptoms in successive generations) and/or with relatives being misdiagnosed with psychiatric conditions/suicide. HD is characterized by a triad of motor, memory, and mood symptoms:

disease (chorea, hyperreflexia, hypokinetic late in Chorea refers to face, trunk, and:limbs that manifest’as (executive dysfunction) and

Motor: Hyperkinetic early in disease (chorea, hyperreflexia, ↑ urine flow [incontinence], hyperhidrosis) early in disease → hypokinetic late in disease (rigidity, dystonia, bradykinesia, dysphagia, dysarthria). Chorea refers to random, brief, and irregular involuntary movements of the face, trunk, and limbs that flow between muscle groups. Early in the disease, chorea may manifest as restlessness/fidgetiness with delayed saccades.

Memory: Cognitive impairment (executive dysfunction) + dementia. Mood: Symptoms of irritability, depression, and disruption of relationships precede

chorea. Other psychiatric symptoms include obsessive-compulsive tendencies, aggression, anxiety, paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, suicidality, and psychosis, which may be mistaken for substance abuse.

Diagnosis Clinical features (motor, memory, mood) + family history (look for anticipation and

misdiagnosed parents/grandparents with psychiatric conditions/suicide). Test creators may obscure these details in adopted children + genetic confirmation (CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions ≥36 repeats).
======================================
Imaging:

FDG-PET early in disease shows altered glucose metabolism in striatum (caudate + putamen).

CT/MRI is important in diagnosing + assessing severity of disease (mainly). Late disease findings are marked atrophy of the cerebrum and the striatum (caudate + putamen). Atrophy, especially head of the caudate nuclei, → dilation of the lateral ventricles (hydrocephalus ex vacuo; see Fig. 2.9-21).

FIGURE 2.9-21. Atrophy of the head of the caudate nuclei in Huntington Disease. (A) Noncontrast CT in a 54-year-old patient with Huntington disease shows atrophy of the cerebrum and caudate nuclei (arrows) → dilation of the lateral ventricles (hydrocephalus ex vacuo). (B) A normal 54-year-old patient with normal cerebral mass, caudate nuclei (arrows), and lateral ventricles. (Modified with permission from Ropper AH, Samuels MA. Adams & Victor’s Principles of Neurology, 9th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2009.)

Treatment No cure exists, and disease progression cannot be halted. Genetic counseling is

recommended. Medical treatment is symptomatic and aimed at motor and associated psychiatric features. Mood disorders such as psychosis/agitation (atypical neuroleptics) and depression/anxiety (first-line treatment: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) should be treated. When approaching treatment, it is important to consider the presence of chorea that interferes with functioning, as it guides drug selection.

Chorea + psychiatric features result from unbalanced DA (loss of GABA/ACh) in brain: Chorea + comorbid depression, agitation ± psychosis → atypical neuroleptics (↓ risk of parkinsonism versus typical psychotics; monitor for adverse effects on motor function).

Chorea without comorbid depression, agitation, and/or psychosis → inhibit vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine) = monoamine depleting agents → inhibit VMAT2 → ↓ DA packing into vesicles → ↓ DA release.

PARKINSON DISEASE AND PARKINSONISM

A progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of neuromelanin- containing dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (part of the basal ganglia). Pathologic examination reveals round, eosinophilic inclusions of alpha-synuclein in degenerating neurons. Typical age at presentation is >50 years, and risk factors include older age and family history of PD—with smoking being protective. PD is the most common hypokinetic movement disorder and is characterized by a unilateral hand tremor (“pill rolling”), oscillating rigidity (cogwheel), akinesia/bradykinesia (shuffling gait), and postural instability (frequent falls). PD is an idiopathic condition, but the motor symptoms (parkinsonism) can occur secondary to other neurodegenerative disorders, trauma, and medications. Treatment aims to ↑ dopaminergic activity (mainly) + ↓ cholinergic activity.
======================================
KEY FACT

The gaits of NPH and PD are similar. A significant difference between them, for diagnostic purposes, is the arm swing: PD gait = Reduced arm swing NPH gait = Preservation of arm swing

swing nonmotor signs of leg syndrome, excessive that predate motor

History/PE Preclinical stage: Characterized by nonmotor signs of constipation, anosmia, sleep disturbances (REM disorders, restless leg syndrome, excessive sleepiness) and by mood disorders (depression, apathy, anxiety) that predate motor symptoms by up to 20 years.

Clinical: Characterized by motor signs (mainly), autonomic dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric features:

Motor signs: Unilateral at onset with possible progression to the contralateral side. Asymmetric (worse on one side). See the TRAPSS mnemonic to recall the following motor signs = parkinsonism:

Tremor: Unilateral resting (4–6 Hz) tremor that improves with movement and worsens with distraction. “Pill-rolling” quality arises from 4- to 6-Hz frequency of thumb and finger movements.

Rigidity: Increased resistance to passive movement that can be uniform (lead pipe) but is classically cogwheeled, resulting in oscillating (“ratchet-like”) joint movements. Akinesia/bradykinesia: Lack of or slowness of movements that can manifest as a narrow-based Shuffling gait with shortened strides + lack of arm swing; Small handwriting (micrographia); hypomimia (masked faces/limited facial expressions); hypophonia (soft speech).

Postural instability: Characterized by a flexed axial posture, loss of balance with stopping/turning, and an increased risk for frequent falls.

Autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (supine hypertensive and/or orthostatic hypotension), increased sweating, oily skin, constipation, sexual dysfunction,

urinary urgency, dysphagia.

Neuropsychiatric: Dementia (advanced disease, see “Diagnosis”), executive/visuospatial dysfunction, visual hallucinations, delusions, sleep disorders (insomnia, restless leg syndrome, REM disorders, daytime sleepiness with sleep attacks, vivid dreams, sleep fragmentation [night awakenings]), depression, anxiety, apathy, anosmia.

Common causes: Typical > atypical antipsychotics, antiemetics (metoclopramide), vesicular dopamine depleters (tetrabenazine, reserpine), CCBs (flunarizine, cinnarizine).

Infrequent causes: Atypical antipsychotics (clozapine and quetiapine [it’s “quiet” so use in PD psychosis]), mood stabilizer (lithium), antiepileptics (valproic acid, phenytoin), antiarrhythmic (amiodarone), MPTP (used in illegal drugs → destruction of substantia nigra → PD).

Liver findings: Consider Wilson disease or hemochromatosis. Dementia = PDD or Lewy body dementia (see “Dementia” section).

KEY FACT

Treatment of Parkinson disease is based on ↑ dopaminergic activity + ↓ cholinergic activity as these circuits become unbalanced with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Dopamine activates the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway to promote

movement.

Acetylcholine inhibits the direct pathway and activates the indirect pathway to inhibit movement.

Treatment General guidelines: With the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, cholinergic circuits operate relatively unopposed. Treatment aims to restore balance by ↑ dopaminergic activity + ↓ cholinergic activity (see Fig. 2.9-22). General side effects of agents that ↑ DA activity include nausea/vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sleepiness, dyskinesias, and confusion/hallucinations. Initial treatment, if possible, involves agents other than levodopa-carbidopa (especially in patients age <65), as long- term use limits utility → “on-off” phenomena.

Tremor-dominant: M1 muscarinic ACh receptor antagonists (trihexyphenidyl, benztropine), with cautious use in older adults or amantadine (↑ DA

activity/anticholinergic).

Mild to moderate symptoms + impact daily living:

KEY FACT

In a patient with severe Parkinson disease who develops psychosis, the patient should not stop PD medications (this would lead to severe akinesia); instead, the patient should use quetiapine (which is the antipsychotic with the least amount of movement side effects—it’s “quiet”).

Best therapy: Nonergot DA receptor agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) → useful as monotherapy in younger patients (age <65).

Moderate to severe symptoms + significant impact on daily living:

first-line treatment in patients age >65 years. Carbidopa blocks peripheral dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase → ↑ CNS bioavailability of levodopa + ↓ peripheral adverse effects.

Quetiapine is “quiet” and has the least movement side effects of the antipsychotics. It is first line in PD patients who develop psychosis. Pimavanserin is an antipsychotic that inhibits 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), not DA, and can also be used.

Anticholinergic side effects: Blind as a bat (mydriasis + impaired lens accommodation), mad as a hatter (altered mental status), red as a beet (flushing), hot as a hare (hyperthermia), dry as a bone (dry mucosae + skin), the bowel and bladder lose their tone (organ paralysis), and the heart runs alone (tachycardia).

Pathology determines phenotype: Parkinson disease → loss of dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia → extrapyramidal

motor symptoms.

Alzheimer disease → loss of cholinergic circuits in cortex/subcortex → dementia.

KEY FACT

If a 55-year-old man presents with slowly progressive weakness with increased reflexes in his left upper extremity and later in his right (upper motor neuron signs) associated with fasciculations and atrophy (lower motor neuron signs) but without bladder disturbance and with a normal cervical MRI, think amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS

Also known as “Lou Gehrig disease” and “motor neuron disease,” amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons. It is often sporadic (90% of cases) but can also be genetic. Age, family history, and cigarette smoking are risk factors. ALS has an unrelenting course and almost always progresses to respiratory failure and death, usually within 5 years of diagnosis. Men are more commonly affected than women, and onset is generally between 40 and 80 years of age.

women, progressive weakness lower cranial nerves. but.can also present

History/PE Presents with asymmetric, slowly progressive weakness (over months to years) affecting

the arms, legs, diaphragm, and lower cranial nerves. Initial presentation is often asymmetric extremity weakness, but can also present with fasciculations (muscle twitching). Weight loss is common.

Associated with UMN and/or LMN UMN and/or LMN signs (Table 2.9-3). Sensation, eye movements, and sphincter tone are generally spared. Emotional lability is a common feature. Differences in symptom onset and spread cause a variable disease presentation in

individuals.
======================================
KEY FACT

About 20% of people have “bulbar onset” ALS, which means patients first present with speech and swallowing symptoms (eg, dysarthria, dysphagia, loss of tongue mobility). Patients may also have pseudobulbar affect (sudden inappropriate laughing or crying episodes).

Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually clinical and follows these criteria:

Progressive motor dysfunction preceded by previously normal motor function Evidence of UMN and LMN involvement in one body segment or evidence of LMN

involvement in at least two body segments

Investigations excluding other diseases that explain these symptoms EMG/nerve conduction studies revealing widespread denervation and spontaneous action potentials (fibrillation potentials). Such studies are principally performed to exclude other demyelinating motor neuropathies

CT/MRI of the cervical spine often performed to exclude structural lesions, such as cervical spondylosis with compressive myelopathy. Especially useful in those without bulbar involvement

KEY FACT

Bulbar involvement (involvement of the tongue [CN XII] or oropharyngeal muscles [CN IX, X]) suggests pathology above the foramen magnum, which distinguishes ALS from cervical spondylosis with compressive myelopathy as the cause of symptoms.

Treatment Supportive measures and patient education. Baclofen can be used for spasticity Serial pulmonary assessments beginning at diagnosis. Patients with ALS most commonly

die from respiratory failure. First-line treatment for respiratory insufficiency is noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV).

Supportive measures and patient education. Riluzole may delay disease progression by 2– 3 months by decreasing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Edaravone, although new, is a medication used for advanced ALS.

RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME

Hx/PE: A common disorder characterized by leg dysesthesias (abnormal sensations of crawling/itching) and an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest, especially when lying flat. These symptoms are partially relieved with movement, and they typically occur with inactivity, classically in the evening/night at bedtime and while sleeping (bed partner may report being kicked at night).

Causes: Classified as primary (idiopathic) or secondary if it occurs in association with the following conditions: iron-deficiency anemia (misuse of iron in CNS → impairs CNS dopaminergic pathways), located near circadian control centers), uremia (end-stage renal disease [ESRD]/chronic kidney disease [CKD]), cancer (especially colon cancer), pregnancy, diabetes, MS, PD, drugs (eg, antidepressants, metoclopramide).
======================================
Dx: Clinical + serum iron studies in all patients. Tx:

Iron supplementation with deficient or low to normal serum ferritin (≤75μg/L) If symptoms are mild/intermittent: Addition of supportive measures (leg massage, heating pads, exercise) + avoid aggravating factors (caffeine, sleep deprivations, certain medications)

If symptoms are persistent/moderate to severe: Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole); neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin, pregabalin)

KEY FACT

Lesions to the superior colliculus can result in Parinaud syndrome: paralysis of conjugate vertical gaze.

WILSON DISEASE OR HEPATOLENTICULAR DEGENERATION

This is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to accumulation of copper in various tissues. Mutation in intracellular copper transporter ATP7B leads to impaired biliary copper excretion and accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea.

Clinical Features Patients usually develop liver disease before 40 years of age: jaundice, hepatitis, ascites, and cirrhosis. Associated neurologic disease (eg, dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism) may manifest early in the course of the disease. Proximal tubular dysfunction leading to Fanconi syndrome can present with glucosuria, aminoaciduria, hypouricemia, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Kayser-Fleischer rings due to copper deposition in the Descemet membrane of the peripheral cornea may be noted on slit-lamp examination.

Q

A 65-year-old man presents to his internist with 10 years of bilateral hand tremors. His mother and older brother have similar tremors. He denies difficulty concentrating, trouble

with rising from seated positions, or recent falls. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Diagnosis Initial test: LFT (look for aspartate aminotransferase [AST]: alanine aminotransferase

[ALT] ratio >2); CBC (look for anemia).

Diagnostic test: Ceruloplasmin level (<20 mg/dL) and urinary copper levels (>100 mcg/dL) with Kayser-Fleischer rings confirm diagnosis.

Most specific test: Liver biopsy.

Treatment Penicillamine is commonly used for chelation, but trientine has fewer side effects. Oral zinc can also be considered as an alternative. A diet low in copper with avoidance of mushrooms, chocolate, nuts, dried fruit, liver, and shellfish is generally advised.

Essential tremor (“benign familial tremor”) is the most likely diagnosis. Unlike the unilateral resting tremor generally seen in Parkinson disease that improves with movement, essential tremors are usually bilateral action tremors that are worsened by movements. Understand that unilateral tremors are classic for Parkinson disease but can progress to bilateral tremors with other motor symptoms (not present in patient history). Patients classically self-medicate essential tremors with alcohol. First-line treatment of essential tremors is with propranolol or primidone.

Intracranial neoplasms may be primary (30%) or metastatic (70%). Of all primary brain tumors, 40% are benign, and these rarely spread beyond the CNS. Metastatic tumors are most often from primary lung, breast, kidney, and GI tract

neoplasms and melanoma. They occur at the gray-white junction; may be multiple discrete nodules; and are characterized by rapid growth, invasiveness, necrosis, and neovascularization.

Neoplasms are more common in males than in females, except for meningiomas.
======================================
KEY FACT

Most CNS tumors are metastatic. The most common primary CNS tumors in adults are glioblastoma multiforme and meningiomas. The most common primary CNS tumors in children are astrocytomas, followed by medulloblastomas.

History/PE Symptoms depend on tumor type and location (see Table 2.9-21), local growth and

resulting mass effect, cerebral edema, or ↑ ICP secondary to ventricular obstruction.

Seizures or slowly progressive focal motor deficits are the most common presenting features.

Although headaches are often thought of as the main presenting symptom, only 31% of patients present with headache at diagnosis, and only 8% have headache as the sole presenting feature.

When ↑ ICP is the presenting feature, symptoms include headache, nausea/vomiting, and diplopia (false localizing CN VI palsies). In the era of neuroimaging, it is relatively rare for patients to present with ↑ ICP.

Other presenting symptoms: Visual field abnormalities, neurologic deficits, psychiatric

symptoms.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CT and MRI with and without contrast to localize and determine the

extent of the lesion.

biopsy or surgical in adults are supratentorial.

KEY FACT

Two thirds of primary brain tumors in adults are supratentorial. One third of those in children are supratentorial.

Treatment Consider resection (if possible), radiation, and chemotherapy after appropriate consultation

with medical and surgical oncology teams.

Therapy is highly dependent on tumor type, histology, progression, and site (see Table 2.9-21).

If ICP is ↑, management of ICP calls for the following: Head elevation (↑ venous outflow from brain) Hyperventilation (↓ CO2 leads to cerebral vasoconstriction resulting in ↓ vasogenic

edema)

Corticosteroids (↓ vasogenic edema) Mannitol and hypertonic saline (extraction of free water from brain via osmotic

diuresis)

Removal of CSF

Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be used in patients who have had a seizure.

Symptoms of ↑ ICP:

Nausea Vomiting Diplopia Headache that is worse in the morning, with bending over, or with recumbency

NEUROCUTANEOUS DISORDERS

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS

The most common neurocutaneous disorder. There are two major types: neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1, or von Recklinghausen syndrome) and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). Both are autosomal dominant diseases caused by mutations to tumor suppressor genes.

History/PE Diagnostic criteria for NF1 include two or more of the following:

1. Six café au lait spots (flat, uniformly hyperpigmented macules). 2. Two neurofibromas (benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors) of any type (see Fig. 2.9-24).
======================================
FIGURE 2.9-24. Neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

3. Freckling in the axillary or inguinal area. 4. Optic glioma (mainly patients under age 6 years). 5. Two Lisch nodules (pigmented iris hamartomas). These are the most specific clinical

features of NF1.

6. Bone abnormality (eg, kyphoscoliosis). 7. A first-degree relative with NF1.

Diagnostic criteria for NF2 are as follows:

Bilateral vestibular schwannomas (also known as acoustic neuromas) First-degree relative with NF2 and either: Unilateral acoustic neuromas, or Two of any of the following tumor types: neurofibroma, meningioma, glioma, or

schwannoma

Other features, including seizures, skin nodules, and café au lait spots

Diagnosis Usually clinical. MRI of the brain, brainstem, and spine with gadolinium. A complete dermatologic examination, ophthalmologic examination, bone evaluation, and family history. Auditory testing is recommended. Genetic testing is often not required for diagnosis.

Evaluation for renal artery stenosis. Patients with NF1 are at increased risk of hypertension due to renovascular lesions, developing as early as childhood.

Carefully screen patients under age of 6 years for optic nerve glioma.

KEY FACT

Treatment There is no cure; treatment is symptomatic (eg, surgery for kyphoscoliosis or debulking of

tumors).

Vestibular schwannomas (see Table 2.9-21) and optic gliomas can be treated with surgery or radiosurgery. Rapidly growing meningiomas can be resected.

Mutation in NF1 tumor suppressor gene causes increased signal transduction through the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway. Use of MEK or MAPK inhibitors (ie, selumetinib) can be used to induce tumor regression.
======================================
TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS

Autosomal dominant disorder that affects many organ systems, including the CNS, skin, heart, retina, lungs, and kidneys. A mutation in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene leads to this disorder. TSC1 codes for the tumor suppressor gene hamartin, and TSC2 codes for the tumor suppressor gene tuberin. Mutations in TSC2 are more common than in TSC1.

History/PE Seizures are the most frequent presenting symptom, with infantile spasms being the most common type. Tuberous sclerosis also presents with “ash-leaf” hypopigmented lesions (Fig. 2.9-25A) on the trunk and extremities and with mental disability (↑ likelihood with early age of onset).

FIGURE 2.9-25. Tuberous sclerosis. (A) “Ash-leaf” macules on a patient with tuberous sclerosis and (B) angiofibromas in a butterfly distribution. (Image A reproduced with permission from Falsafi P, Taghavi-Zenouz A, Khorshidi-Khiyavi R, et al A case of tuberous sclerosis without multiorgan involvement.

Other skin manifestations include angiofibromas (small red nodules on the nose and cheeks in the distribution of a butterfly Fig. 2.9-25B), shagreen patch (a rough papule in the lumbosacral region with an orange-peel consistency), and periungual fibromas.

small benign tumors example: from cardiac carcinomas brainlesions (eg, (LAM).is cystic lung disease late manifestation of

Other symptoms are secondary to small benign tumors that grow on the face, eyes, brain, kidney, and other organs. For example:

Congestive heart failure (CHF) from cardiac rhabdomyoma; renal disease from renal cysts, angiomyolipomas, or carcinomas

Developmental disability from brain lesions (eg, subependymal nodules)

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is cystic lung disease that is also due to a mutation in the TSC. LAM can present as a late manifestation of tuberous sclerosis, often in the third or fourth decade, or it can occur sporadically. Sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, has been found to slow disease progression.
======================================
KEY FACT

Infantile spasms occur in children <3 years of age and can consist of head bobbing, flexor spasms, extensor spasms, or movements that mimic the startle response. They may be associated with psychomotor regression or behavioral changes.

Diagnosis Usually clinical Ash-leaf lesions enhanced by a Wood’s ultraviolet (UV) light lamp Imaging:

MRI of brain: Evaluate for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and calcified tubers (potato-like nodules) within the cerebrum in the periventricular area. If lesions obstruct CSF outflow, obstructive hydrocephalus can develop.

Ophthalmic exam: Evaluate for retinal hamartomas and eyelid angiofibromas. Echocardiography: Evaluate for rhabdomyoma of the heart, especially in the apex of

»

the left ventricle (affects >50% of patients).

MRI of abdomen: Evaluate for renal disease (cysts, angiomyolipoma, and/or carcinoma).

EEG: Evaluate for seizure activity.

Treatment Treatment should be based on symptoms (eg, cosmetic surgery for facial sebaceous

adenomas).

Seizures should be treated.

When standard epileptic medications fail, mTOR inhibitors (eg, everolimus) can help reduce seizures.

If infantile spasms are present, first-line treatment is with vigabatrin, which enhances GABA transmission. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can be used as an alternative/adjunctive.

Surgical intervention may be indicated in the setting of ↑ ICP from obstructive hydrocephalus or for seizures associated with an epileptogenic focus or severe developmental delay.

STURGE-WEBER SYNDROME

Sturge-Weber syndrome is due to a somatic mosaic mutation in the GNAQ gene, and therefore is not an inheritable disease.

wine stain) is. usually diagnosis of Sturge-Weber disorder with isolated port capillary-venous and are thus diagnosed

History/PE Facial capillary malformation (port wine stain) is usually in a V1 distribution. This finding in isolation does not qualify for the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome since GNAQ mutations constitute a spectrum disorder with isolated port wine stain as the mildest form. Twenty percent have a leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation of the brain and eye that is adjacent to the port wine stain and are thus diagnosed as having Sturge-Weber syndrome. The brain parenchyma may be atrophic and contain calcific deposits. Seizures, strokelike episodes, hemiparesis, and mental retardation commonly occur.

Diagnosis Preferred diagnostic test is brain MRI with contrast. The image may reveal intracranial calcifications that resemble a “tramline.”

Treatment Photothermolysis can be used for treatment of port wine stains. Low-dose aspirin beginning in infancy may decrease the frequency and duration of

seizures.

Anticonvulsant medications are first line for management of seizures.
======================================
VON HIPPLE-LINDAU SYNDROME

Von Hipple-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is an inherited autosomal dominant condition characterized by the presence of benign and malignant tumors in many organ systems, including the retina, CNS, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenals. It is caused by a mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Patients with type 1 VHL have a very low risk of developing pheochromocytoma, but patients with type II VHL (caused by missense mutations) have a

higher risk for pheochromocytoma.

History/PE Hemangioblastomas are the hallmark tumors of VHL. When they occur in the CNS,

Hemangioblastomas are the hallmark tumors of VHL. When they occur in the CNS, especially the cerebellum and spinal cord, they can cause ataxia and headaches. Retinal hemangioblastomas may cause vision loss, and they are often identified on fundoscopy.

especially the cerebellum and spinal cord, they can cause ataxia and headaches. Retinal hemangioblastomas may cause vision loss, and they are often identified on fundoscopy. One half of all cases of pheochromocytomas under the age of 18 years are due to VHL,

and they result in episodes of palpitations, hypertension, and sweating.

Other VHL-associated tumors include:

Renal cell carcinoma (clear cell type) and renal cysts Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas Endolymphatic sac tumor Papillary cystadenoma of epididymis and broad ligament Epididymal cysts

Diagnosis Genetic testing for individuals with manifestations of VHL disease or family history MRI of the brain and spinal cord to evaluate for lesions Levels of catecholamines to evaluate for presence of pheochromocytoma Complete audiologic exam to evaluate for hearing loss (can be caused by endolymphatic

considered. If unresectable or if there are contraindications to surgery, treatment with belzutifan (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF]-2 alpha inhibitor) can be considered. In VHL disease, levels of HIF-1A and HIF-2A transcription factors are elevated, causing an increase in physiologic angiogenesis via upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).

Patients with renal cell carcinoma >3 cm should undergo surgical intervention rather than routine surveillance.
======================================
ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA

Autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the ATM gene, which encodes DNA repair enzymes. Leads to aberrant repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, causing cell death (eg, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum are particularly susceptible).

History/PE Cerebellar ataxia is often the first presenting symptom in infancy or early childhood. Patients may also present with ocular apraxia (inability to control purposeful eye movements), cognitive impairment, extrapyramidal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy.

Telangiectasias are common, most often in the face, eyes, and ears. Immune deficiency (especially IgA) predisposes patients to recurrent sinopulmonary

infections, which may lead to interstitial lung disease.

Up to one fourth of patients will develop a malignancy, most often lymphomas or leukemias.

Diagnosis Usually clinical, but genetic testing supportive of diagnosis Low IgA Elevated levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP) often seen Imaging studies involving ionizing radiation to be minimized

Treatment No specific treatment exists for progressive ataxia and cerebellar degeneration. Infections should be treated with antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics can be considered.

======================================
IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

A disorder characterized by raised ICP with neurologic manifestations such as headaches, papilledema (most common), and vision loss, without any indication toward another cause of raised ICP on neuroimaging. The disease has no proven etiology (idiopathic), but is believed to be either due to decreased resorption and/or increased production of CSF. Other proposed mechanisms include vascular (transverse sinus stenosis), hormonal (aldosterone excess), and cellular (increased outflow resistance to CSF). Risk factors include female sex, obesity, use of tetracyclines, and hypervitaminosis A.

History/PE Patients usually have bilateral, frontal (retrobulbar) headache, more pronounced in the

mornings and on Valsalva; transient visual loss; diplopia; pulsatile tinnitus.

Sixth nerve (abducens) palsy may be a nonlocalizing sign of raised ICP.

Diagnosis Neuroimaging (MRI with venography) is preferred to rule out other causes of raised ICP.

CT done when MRI contraindicated.

CSF opening pressure >25 cm H2O in adults is suggestive of diagnosis. Ophthalmologic evaluation is mandatory to rule out papilledema (see Ophthalmology

section).

Treatment Goals of therapy include alleviation of symptoms and preservation of vision. Best first treatment when patients have minimal symptoms is to address risk

factors/comorbidities and advise weight loss.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, is best first medication to use in these patients.

Q

A 61-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-month history of progressively worsening nausea and morning headache. The patient is in no apparent acute distress. What is the preferred diagnostic study?

When medical therapy fails, the physician should consider topiramate and serial LPs (not preferred, as CSF reforms within 6 hours) prior to surgery.

Surgery is advised when patients have worsening visual defects despite medical therapy, and presence of visual acuity loss is secondary to papilledema. Performed procedures include optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) and CSF-shunting procedures.

Painful abscess of the eyelid, also called a stye, caused by inflammation or infection of a sebaceous gland located around the eyelash (Zeis and Moll) or inner lid margin (meibomian). S aureus is the most common pathogen. Hordeolum presents with localized swelling and erythema. Initial management consists of warm, moist compresses, topical antibiotic/steroids ointment, and lid massage several times a day to facilitate drainage. Refractory hordeola may be referred to ophthalmologists for incision and drainage.

CHALAZION

Granulomatous lesion of the eyelid that presents with localized swelling and a nontender, hard nodule. Differentiated from a hordeolum by a comparative lack of erythema and pain. Management includes warm compress, topical antibiotic/steroid combination, and possible incision and drainage (refractory lesions).

This patient presents with symptoms that are concerning for increased ICP. As he is not in acute distress, MRI is the preferred study because it is better for visualizing soft tissue and vascularity.

BLEPHARITIS

A chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelash follicles (anterior) or Meibomian glands (posterior) of the eyelid, producing lid irritation that may lead to erythema and pruritis of the eyelid or conjunctiva (Fig. 2.9-27), excessive tear production, eyelash crusting, and light

sensitivity. Initial treatment is with warm compresses, lid hygiene, and lubricating drops to prevent corneal dryness. Patients who do not respond to initial therapy are treated with topical erythromycin. Oral antibiotics (doxycycline, azithromycin) may be used for refractory cases. Lid hygiene, including washing, and avoidance of irritants such as smoke, eye makeup, or contact lenses is emphasized to prevent future symptoms.

CORNEAL ABRASION

(Fig. 2.9-28A) caused report severe-eye pain, fluorescein-examination, abrasion under a Wood’s foreign body, pain control, contact lens wearers

Damage to the corneal epithelium (Fig. 2.9-28A) caused by trauma (including from foreign bodies or contact lenses). Patients report severe eye pain, foreign body sensation, and photophobia. Diagnosis is made by fluorescein examination, where there is increased uptake of fluorescein stain in the area of abrasion under a Wood’s lamp (Fig. 2.9-28B). Treatment consists of removing any retained foreign body, pain control, and topical antibiotic therapy. Fluoroquinolone drops are used for contact lens wearers due to risk of Pseudomonas infection, whereas erythromycin ointment or polymyxin/trimethoprim drops are suitable for patients who do not wear contact lenses.

PRESEPTAL (PERIORBITAL) CELLULITIS

Infection of the eyelid and surrounding soft tissue anterior to the orbital septum. Presents with painful erythema and edema of the eyelid. S aureus is the most common pathogen. Patients with no skin trauma are treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, whereas patients with skin trauma are covered for methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) with the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin. This condition is differentiated from the more serious orbital (postseptal) cellulitis by lack of ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movement, or proptosis. CT of the orbit can be used to differentiate the site of infection in unclear cases.
======================================
Q

A 24-year-old female with a body mass index (BMI) of 33 presents with a 3-week history of constant retro-orbital headache with occasional nausea, vomiting, and tinnitus. She also developed new-onset diplopia 2 hours before presentation. On physical examination, she is noted to have papilledema. What is the most likely diagnosis, and what are the risk factors for this condition?

ORBITAL (POSTSEPTAL) CELLULITIS

Infection of the ocular muscles or orbital fat, sparing the globe, that may lead to vision loss or death if left untreated. Commonly caused by direct spread of infection from the paranasal sinuses. Other causes include trauma, ophthalmic surgeries, dental infections, and dacryocystitis. It is usually caused by staphylococci (including MRSA), streptococci, and H influenzae (in children). In patients with diabetes and immunocompromise, Mucor and Rhizopus must be included in the differential diagnosis.

KEY FACT

Orbital cellulitis can be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis by the presence of the following clinical features: restricted or painful eye movements, ↓ visual acuity, diplopia, proptosis, and presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect.

History/PE Presents with acute-onset fever, proptosis, ↓ extraocular movement, ocular pain, and ↓ visual acuity. The physician should look for a history of ocular trauma/surgery or sinusitis. Palatal or nasal mucosal ulceration with coexisting maxillary and/or ethmoid sinusitis suggests mucormycosis or Rhizopus.

Diagnosis Mostly clinical. Best initial test: Blood and tissue fluid culture. CT scan or MRI of the orbit and sinuses to rule out orbital abscess and intracranial involvement.

Blood and tissue fluid.culture. and intracranial:involvement. and administered Metronidazole is added nose, throat (ENT)

Treatment The patient should be admitted and administered broad-spectrum IV antibiotics such as vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Metronidazole is added for intracranial extension; case requires an ophthalmologic/ear, nose, throat (ENT) consult.

Abscess formation or a worsening condition may necessitate surgery. Patients with diabetes or immunocompromise should be treated with amphotericin B and surgical debridement (often associated with cavernous sinus thrombosis) if Mucor or Rhizopus is diagnosed.
======================================
KEY FACT

Neisseria conjunctivitis is an ocular emergency often requiring inpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy.

CONJUNCTIVITIS

Inflammation of the conjunctiva producing a red-appearing eye (Fig. 2.9-30). It is most often allergic, viral, or bacterial but can also be fungal, parasitic, or chemical. It is essential to differentiate potentially vision-threatening infectious etiologies from allergic or other causes of conjunctivitis and to identify other vision-threatening conditions that may mimic conjunctivitis. Table 2.9-23 lists the common etiologies of infectious conjunctivitis.

Allergic conjunctivitis: Bilateral predominantly itchy eyes. Treat with antihistamine (olopatadine) eye drops.

Bacterial conjunctivitis: Purulent discharge. Treat with erythromycin ointment or fluoroquinolone drops in contact lens wearers.

Viral conjunctivitis: Watery discharge, often bilateral. Self-limiting. Treat with antihistamine (olopatadine) or lubricating eye drops for symptomatic relief.
======================================
A

Given this patient’s symptoms and risk factors, she probably has pseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). In IIH, symptoms are suggestive of a brain tumor, and CSF pressure will be ↑; however, neuroimaging will be normal. Obesity, tetracycline, growth hormone, and excess vitamin A are risk factors for the disease. Treatment is with acetazolamide, topiramate, optic nerve fenestration, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt if needed.

ACUTE DACRYOCYSTITIS

Infection of the lacrimal sac, usually by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus spp. May progress to orbital cellulitis or meningitis if left untreated. Congenital nasolacrimal duct stenosis and dacryocystocele (nasolacrimal duct cyst) are predisposing conditions. Hx/PE: Presentation with purulent eye discharge, as well as inflammation overlying the

lacrimal system and medial eyelids (medial canthal region) (Fig. 2.9-31). Less commonly fever and ↑ WBC.

Dx: Clinical diagnosis. Tx: If mild, oral anti-staphylococcus/streptococcus agents. If serious, immediate empiric

broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent orbital cellulitis.

HERPES SIMPLEX KERATITIS

Viral infection of the cornea. Common cause of visual impairment in the United States.

Hx/PE: Presents with pain, blurred vision, tearing, and redness. The virus remains dormant along the trigeminal nerve and may reactivate during periods of immunocompromise such as illness.

Dx: Typically clinical. However, dendritic ulcers (Fig. 2.9-32) are characteristic. Epithelial scrapings show multinucleated giant cells. PCR of conjunctival/corneal swab for confirmation.

Tx: Oral or topical antiviral therapy.
======================================
CONTACT LENS KERATITIS

Medical emergency, often caused by Pseudomonas infection. Hx/PE: Typically presents with painful, red eye and opacification and ulceration of the cornea. Most patients report a history of improper contact lens hygiene, such as reusing lens solution or showering/swimming with lenses in. Severe disease can cause corneal perforation and permanent vision loss.

bacterial culture contact lens and administration

Dx: Clinical. Corneal scrape and bacterial culture are usually performed for antibiotic sensitivity.

Tx: Immediate removal of the contact lens and administration of topical broad-spectrum antibiotics.

UVEITIS

Infectious or noninfectious inflammation of the uvea—specific name is based on location within the affected eye. Anterior uveitis: iritis; posterior uveitis: choroiditis and/or retinitis. Associated with systemic inflammatory disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- B27–associated conditions)

History/PE Patients with anterior uveitis may have pain and redness of the eye—often worse at the

limbus (corneal-scleral junction) (Fig. 2.9-33). They may have hypopyon (accumulation of pus in anterior chamber).

FIGURE 2.9-33. Uveitis. (Reproduced with permission from Barut K, Rzayev T, Canpolat N, et al. Acute granulomatous

iridocyclitis in a child with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome. J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect. 2015;5:3. Published 2015 Feb 13. doi:10.1186/s12348-015-0035-2.

Posterior uveitis presents with visual changes such as decreased visual acuity or floaters in the visual fields.

Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by slitlamp examination showing leukocytes in the anterior chamber, vitreous humor, or other signs of inflammation of the retina.

Treatment Treatment of infectious uveitis is targeted toward the specific pathogen. Noninfectious uveitis is treated with topical glucocorticoids. Oral or intraocular

glucocorticoids are used for refractory cases.
======================================
REFRACTIVE ERRORS

Common cause of impaired vision, correctable with glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery.

Hyperopia, also called “farsightedness.” Eye too short for refractive power of cornea and lens → light focused behind retina. Correct with convex (converging) lenses.

Correct with convex Eye too long for retina. Correct with of cornea —.different

Myopia, also called “nearsightedness.” Eye too long for refractive power of cornea and lens → light focused in front of retina. Correct with concave (diverging) lens.

Astigmatism, irregular curvature of cornea → different refractive power at different axes. Correct with cylindrical lens.

PRESBYOPIA

Aging-related impaired accommodation (focusing on near objects), primarily due to ↓ lens elasticity, changes in lens curvature, and ↓ strength of the ciliary muscle. Patients often need “reading glasses” (magnifiers).

GLAUCOMA

In the eye, aqueous humor produced by the ciliary body behind the iris travels through the pupil into the anterior chamber and is then drained back into the bloodstream via the trabecular meshwork in the angle of the anterior chamber.

KEY FACT

Closed-angle glaucoma headaches are triggered by darkness (caused by pupillary dilation). Migraine headaches are triggered by bright lights.
======================================
KEY FACT

Open-angle glaucoma generally occurs bilaterally, but closed-angle glaucoma usually presents unilaterally.

Any process that disrupts this natural flow (Fig. 2.9-34) can ↑ intraocular pressure (IOP), damaging the optic nerve head and causing visual field deficits. Glaucoma is the result of such damage to the nerve.

CATARACT

Lens opacification resulting in obstructed passage of light (Fig. 2.9-36). Associated with diabetes, HTN, advanced age, and exposure to radiation or corticosteroids. Congenital risk factors: classic galactosemia, galactokinase deficiency, trisomies (13, 18, 21), TORCH infections (eg, rubella), Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and neurofibromatosis 2.

Hx/PE: Presents with reduced visual acuity, especially at night, and loss of the red reflex.

Tx: Surgical lens removal and replacement.

Q

A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe eye pain, photophobia, and a persistent sensation that something is in his eye. The physician is suspicious of a corneal abrasion. What are the risk factors for this condition, and what diagnostic test can you do to confirm your suspicion?

AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is more common among White individuals, females, people who smoke, and those with a family history.

History/PE Presents with painless loss of central vision. Early signs include distortion of straight lines

(metamorphopsia) and loss of other aspects of fine visual acuity.

include trauma, foreign function and the presence/absence diagnostic and will show foreign body due to damage degeneration: Responsible

Risk factors for corneal abrasion include trauma, foreign body, and contact lens use. Use a penlight to document pupillary function and the presence/absence of a foreign body. A fluorescein examination can be diagnostic and will show a corneal staining defect. Pain persists even after departure of foreign body due to damage and sensitization of corneal nerves.

Atrophic (“dry”) macular degeneration: Responsible for 80% of cases. It causes gradual vision loss.

Exudative or neovascular (“wet”) macular degeneration: Much less common but associated with more rapid and severe vision loss.

Diagnosis Atrophic (“dry”) macular degeneration: Fundoscopy reveals drusen (accumulation of

white/yellow extracellular material) and/or pigmentary changes (Fig. 2.9-37).
======================================

FIGURE 2.9-37. Macular degeneration with evidence of drusen and fibrosis on fundoscopic exam. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Exudative or neovascular (“wet”) macular degeneration: Hemorrhage and subretinal fluid are present.

Treatment Atrophic AMD: No treatment is currently available, although a combination of vitamins

(vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and zinc) has been found to slow disease progression. The physician should be cautious about giving high doses of vitamin E and beta-carotene to patients who smoke, as there is an association of ↑ mortality rate from lung cancer in people taking high doses of these supplements.

OPTIC NEURITIS

Inflammation of the optic nerve that is commonly associated with MS. Other optic neuropathies may be caused by ischemia, infection/postinfection (meningitis, encephalitis), vasculitis, connective tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], Sjögren), genetic conditions, and drugs (eg, methanol, ethambutol, linezolid, infliximab).

KEY FACT

For optic neuritis, give IV, not oral, corticosteroids.

History/PE/Diagnosis Optic neuritis produces painful vision loss that is often unilateral. It causes relative

afferent pupillary defect (Marcus-Gunn pupil).

Fundoscopy may show disc swelling that looks similar to papilledema; however, fundoscopy is normal in two thirds of patients because the inflammation is posterior to the optic nerve head.

The diagnosis is clinical, based on history and physical exam. Diagnosis may be confirmed with MRI of the orbits.

Treatment Methylprednisolone IV for 3 days, followed by oral steroids. Oral steroids alone may increase risk of recurrence. Most patients gradually recover vision even without treatment, although IV methylprednisolone increases the rate of recovery.

RETINAL DETACHMENT

Separation of the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid. May be caused by retinal tears, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or trauma. High myopia (>6 diopters of correction required) is a risk factor.

History/PE Sudden-onset painless monocular vision loss is often associated with floaters and flashes

of light.

a curtain ascending or trauma may cause vitreous complication presents with

Visual field defect may resemble a curtain ascending or descending over the eye. Retinal detachment and other trauma may cause vitreous hemorrhage, where the vitreous humor fills with blood. This complication presents with black spots and cobweb shapes in the visual field.

KEY FACT

O=n

Retinal detachment presents with sudden-onset flashing lights and blurred vision. Patients typically describe a curtain coming down over their eye. Ophthalmoscopy shows a gray, elevated retina.

Diagnosis All patients should have visual field and acuity testing. The detached retina can be seen floating in the posterior chamber on ultrasound. Definitive diagnosis requires a dilated funduscopic exam, where the detached retina can be

directly visualized (Fig. 2.9-38).

FIGURE 2.9-38. Retinal detachment on fundoscopic examination. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)
======================================
Treatment Tamponading of the retina via surgery (vitrectomy or scleral buckle).

DIABETIC RETINOPATHY

Retinal damage due to chronic hyperglycemia. Two types:

capillaries leak blood.» edema. Treatment: results in new blood detachment. Treatment:

Nonproliferative—Damaged capillaries leak blood → lipids and fluid seep into retina causing hemorrhages and macular edema. Treatment: Blood sugar and blood pressure control.

Proliferative—Chronic hypoxia results in new blood vessel formation with resultant traction on retina → retinal detachment. Treatment: Anti-VEGF injections, peripheral retinal photocoagulation, or surgery.

HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY

Chronic uncontrolled HTN → endothelial disruption → fibrinoid necrosis → retinal damage.

Flame-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, microaneurysms, macular star, cotton-wool spots (blue arrow in Fig. 2.9-43). Presence of papilledema in a hypertensive patient is indicative of malignant hypertension and requires immediate lowering of BP.

Associated with risk of stroke, CAD, and kidney disease.

RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA

Inherited progressive dystrophy of RPE and photoreceptors. It may be associated with abetalipoproteinemia. Early findings include nyctalopia (night blindness) and peripheral vision loss. Fundoscopy may show triad of optic disc pallor, retinal vessel attenuation, and retinal pigmentation with bone spicule-shaped deposits (Fig. 2.9-39).

FIGURE 2.9-39. Retinitis pigmentosa on fundoscopic exam. (Modified with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

PAPILLEDEMA

Optic disc swelling with blurred disc margins and dilated/tortuous retinal veins (usually bilateral) due to ↑ ICP (eg, secondary to mass effect). Enlarged blind spot and elevated optic disc (Fig. 2.9-40) with blurred margins.

FIGURE 2.9-40. Papilledema on fundoscopic exam. (Modified with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

LEUKOCORIA

Loss (whitening) of the red reflex (Fig. 2.9-41). Important causes in children include retinoblastoma and congenital cataract.

======================================
RELATIVE AFFERENT PUPILLARY DEFECT

Also called Marcus-Gunn pupil. When the light shines into a normal eye, constriction of the ipsilateral (direct reflex) and contralateral pupil (consensual reflex) is observed. When the light is then swung to the affected eye (side of optic nerve defect), both pupils dilate instead of constricting due to impaired conduction of a light signal along the injured optic nerve. It is associated with optic neuritis (eg, MS) and optic neuropathies (eg, giant cell arteritis).

HORNER SYNDROME

Sympathetic denervation of face causing:

Ptosis (slight drooping of eyelid: superior tarsal muscle) Anhidrosis (absence of sweating) and flushing of affected side of face Miosis (pupil constriction)

Associated with lesions along the sympathetic chain (Fig. 2.9-42):

ORBITAL BLOWOUT FRACTURE

Orbital floor fracture; usually caused by direct trauma to eyeball or intraorbital rim. ↑ risk of inferior rectus muscle and/or orbital fat entrapment. It may lead to infraorbital nerve injury.

CAVERNOUS SINUS SYNDROME

Cavernous sinus syndrome presents with variable ophthalmoplegia (CNs III and VI involved most frequently), ↓ corneal sensation, Horner syndrome, and decreased maxillary sensation. Secondary to pituitary tumor mass effect, carotid-cavernous fistula, or cavernous sinus thrombosis related to infection

OTOLOGY

OTITIS MEDIA

Acute Otitis Media

History/PE Pain in the ear, redness, decreased hearing, and fever. On otoscopy, bulging, hypomobile, and decreased light reflex of tympanic membrane are seen.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Usually empirically treated with antibiotics. Consider tympanocentesis with culture in case of recurrent infections.

Treatment Initial best treatment: Amoxicillin for 10 days. If no response, the patient has been treated with amoxicillin recently, or symptoms return within 1 month, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be used.

Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media Similar to acute otitis media except: Continuous suppuration for >6 weeks with tympanic membrane perforation Prolonged duration of symptoms—drainage, pain, and hearing loss Absence of systemic symptoms such as fever

Otitis Media With Effusion/Serous Otitis Media/Glue Ear Fluid in the middle ear for >3 months without an infection.

History/PE May be asymptomatic. Painless pressure in the ear post–acute otitis media in children. Otoscopy shows air-fluid level behind the bulging tympanic membrane and hypomobility.
======================================
Q

A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset headache and a dilated pupil in his right eye that is nonreactive to light. His right eye is hard to the touch. What is the most likely diagnosis, and what medications should be avoided in this patient?

Treatment Monitoring for 3 months. If hearing impairment is resulting in speech impairment, tymapnostomy tubes may be considered.

OTITIS EXTERNA

Inflammation of the external auditory canal, also known as “swimmer’s ear.” Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus are the most common etiologic agents. Both grow in the presence of excess moisture. Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa (Pseudomonas in >95%) can lead to osteomyelitis of the skull base.

History/PE Presents with pain, pruritus, hearing loss, and possible purulent discharge. Examination reveals pain with movement of the tragus/pinna (unlike otitis media), an edematous and erythematous ear canal, and granulation tissue if necrotizing type. Cranial nerve palsies may be visible in the necrotizing type. See the Pediatrics chapter for a discussion of otitis media.

Diagnosis A clinical diagnosis. A culture for severe or refractory cases. CT scan if the patient appears toxic.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Aural toilet (clean and dry ear [eg, using wick and/or astringents]). Mild otitis externa can be treated with topical acetic acid (7–10) days. Moderate otitis externa is treated with topical antibiotics (ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) and

steroid ear drops.

Older adults with diabetes and individuals who are immunocompromised are at risk for necrotizing otitis externa and may require IV antibiotics (usually a fluoroquinolone or fourth-generation cephalosporin).

Consider wick placement if occlusion of canal. To prevent, patients should avoid getting moisture in the ear and should thoroughly dry

their ears after swimming,

MALIGNANT OTITIS EXTERNA

History/PE Severe infection of the external auditory meatus occurs with ear pain and suppurative

drainage. Granulation tissue is seen on otoscopy. Malignant otitis externa is commonly seen in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and individuals who are immunosuppressed.

used (eg, ceftazidime, cefepime, quinolones, aztreonam, piperacillin/tazobactam). Surgical debridement and biopsy are required with failure to respond to antibiotics.

This patient’s presentation is consistent with closed-angle glaucoma. The physician should avoid pupil-dilating medications such as atropine, which will ↑ IOP and prevent drainage of aqueous humor.
======================================
SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS

Etiology Ménière disease—hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and aural fullness due to excessive

endolymph in the inner ear.

Presbycusis—bilateral, symmetric age-related hearing loss to high-frequency sounds due to degenerative changes in inner ear and CN VIII. Hearing is worse in noisy environments.

THE BASICS OF PREGNANCY

The terms and concepts that follow are central to an understanding of the physiologic processes of pregnancy:

Gravidity: Number of times a woman has been pregnant Parity: Number of pregnancies that led to a birth beyond 20 weeks’ gestational age or an

infant weighing >500 g (1 lb, 2 oz).

In prenatal assessment, TPAL expresses the number of term deliveries (T), the number of preterm deliveries (P), the number of abortuses (A), and the number of living children (L).

Embryonic age: Number of weeks + days since fertilization; usually unknown Gestational age (GA): The number of weeks and days measured from the first day of the

Gestational age (GA): The number of weeks and days measured from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). GA can also be determined by the following:

last menstrual period (LMP). GA can also be determined by the following: Fundal height: Reaches umbilicus (approximately 22 cm) at 20 weeks; +1 cm/week of

gestational age thereafter

Fetal heart tones (Doppler): Typically, 10 to 12 weeks Quickening or appreciation of fetal movement: Occurs at 16 weeks for multiparas and

20 weeks for primiparas at the earliest
======================================
Ultrasonography:

Most accurate dating method in early pregnancy: Fetal crown-rump length (CRL) at 6 to 12 weeks

Preferred measurement from 13 weeks+: Biometry using biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC)

KEY FACT

A G3P1 patient has had three pregnancies but only one birth beyond 20 weeks and/or an infant who weighs at least 500 g.

DIAGNOSIS OF PREGNANCY

β−HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN (β-hCG)

The standard for diagnosing pregnancy. Can be detected in serum or urine. Serum β-hCG more sensitive and preferred if menstrual period is <1 week late. Produced by the placenta; peaks at 100,000 mIU/mL by 10 weeks. ↓ throughout the second trimester; plateaus in the third trimester. β-hCG levels double approximately every 48 hours during early pregnancy; failure of hCG

plateaus in the third every 48 hours during concerning for miscarriage

levels to double every 48 hours concerning for miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.

KEY FACT

Get a quantitative serum β-hCG: To help diagnose ectopic pregnancy and follow the trend for resolution after treatment To help diagnose miscarriage To monitor after treatment of trophoblastic disease (rising levels concerning for

choriocarcinoma)

To screen for fetal aneuploidy

ULTRASONOGRAPHY

Used to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy Gestational sac visible on transvaginal ultrasonography by:

5 weeks A β-hCG in the range of 1500 to 3500 mIU/mL

Transabdominal ultrasound (US) typically reserved for second-/third-trimester measurements

PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES IN PREGNANCY

Table 2.10-1 describes the physiologic changes seen in pregnancy, as well as their

mechanisms. These changes occur to increase perfusion to the fetus, optimize materno-fetal gas exchange, and alter the maternal pelvis to aid in delivery.

======================================
PRENATAL CARE AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING

The goal of prenatal care is to prevent, diagnose, and treat conditions that can lead to adverse fetal or maternal outcomes in pregnancy. Expected weight gain, nutrition, and exercise recommendations are outlined in Table 2.10-2. Maternal failure to gain appropriate weight is associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR), whereas excess weight gain is associated with diabetes.

TABLE 2.10-2. Recommendations for Standard Prenatal Care

CATEGORY RECOMMENDATIONS Weight gain Guidelines for weight gain according to prepregnancy body mass index (BMI): « Underweight (BMI <18.5): 12-18 kg (28-40 Ib) » Acceptable (BMI 18.5-24.9): 11-16 kg (25-35 Ib) » Overweight (BMI 25-29.9): 7-11 kg (15-25 Ib) = Obese (all classes, BMI > 30): 5-9 kg (11-20 Ib) Nutrition Guidelines for nutritional supplementation: An additional 100-300 kcal/day; additional 500 kcal/day during breastfeeding a a Folic acid supplements 400 mcg daily or 4000 mcg if previous neural tube defect or maternal use of valproate or carbamazepine (folate supplementation J neural tube defects for all reproductive-age women) © Iron Calcium Additional guidelines for vegans and others limiting meat/dairy intake: « Vitamin D » Vitamin B,, Exercise Thirty minutes of moderate exercise daily, while avoiding contact sports Harmful « Avoid fish with high mercury levels substances = Moderate caffeine intake » Avoid uncooked meat, fish, eggs « Avoid unpasteurized dairy

moderate exercise daily, high mercury levels intake meat, fish, eggs

GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS TESTING AND TREATMENT

Screening for group B streptococcus (GBS): Rectovaginal swab at 36 to 38 weeks. Indications for intrapartum prophylaxis:

GBS-positive rectovaginal swab at 36 to 38 weeks GBS bacteriuria/urinary tract infection (UTI) any time during pregnancy Prior infant with early-onset GBS sepsis Unknown GBS status with any of the following: labor at <37 weeks, intrapartum fever,

rupture of membranes >18 hours

Intrapartum prophylaxis: Intravenous (IV) penicillin (regardless of mode of birth); first- generation cephalosporins for patients with low-risk penicillin allergy; clindamycin or vancomycin for high risk of anaphylaxis
======================================
PRENATAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTING

Table 2.10-3 outlines a typical prenatal diagnostic testing schedule by week. The sections that

follow describe each recommended screening modality.

TABLE 2.10-3. Prenatal Visit and Diagnostic Testing Schedule

PRENATAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTING Prenatal visits | Weeks 0-28: Every 4 weeks Weeks 29-35: Every 2 weeks Weeks 36-birth: Every week Initial visit Heme: Complete blood cell count (CBC); type and screen (important for determining Rh status) Infectious disease: Urinalysis (UA) and culture; rubella antibody titer; hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); Hepatitis C antigen; rapid plasma reagin (RPR)/Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL); cervical gonorrhea and chlamydia; purified protein derivative (PPD); HIV; tuberculosis (TB) testing (or Mycobacterium tuberculosis [M.tb]); Pap smear (to check for dys- plasia); consideration of hepatitis C vaccine (HCV) and varicella vaccine, based on history If indicated: Hemoglobin (Hb)A1¢, sickle cell screening Discussion of genetic screening: Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy 10-22 weeks Aneuploidy screening: Multiple options are possible: = Cell-free DNA screening most sensitive and specific screening tool available for trisomies 13, 18, and 21 (see Table 2.10-4).

Quadruple Screening Quadruple screening consists of four elements (see Table 2.10-4): maternal serum α- fetoprotein (MSAFP), inhibin A, estriol, and β-hCG.
======================================
TABLE 2.10-4. Quadruple Screening for Fetal Aneuploidy

MSAFP ESTRIOL INHIBIN A B-HCG Trisomy 18 L Ld Ld IW Trisomy 21 alt L T T

MSAFP: Produced by the fetus and enters the maternal circulation. Results are reported as multiples of the median (MoMs).

Measurement results depend on accurate gestational dating. Multiple gestations and uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) may cause size/date discrepancy.

MSAFP is rarely tested alone, as quad screening has ↑ sensitivity for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.

↑ MSAFP (>2.5 MoMs) is associated with the following: Open neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifida) Abdominal wall defects (gastroschisis, omphalocele)

Multiple gestation Incorrect gestational dating Fetal death Placental abnormalities (eg, placental abruption)

↓ MSAFP (<0.5 MoMs) is associated with the following:

ABORTION  SPONTANEOUS ABORTION 

The loss of gestation before 20 weeks’ gestation. More than 80% of cases occur in the first trimester. Associations are as follows: Maternal factors:

Inherited thrombophilia: Factor V Leiden, prothrombin, antithrombin, protein C and S deficiencies, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (hyperhomocysteinemia)

Immunologic issues: Antiphospholipid antibodies; alloimmune factors Anatomic issues: Uterine and cervical abnormalities, cervical insufficiency, cervical

conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), cervical injury, diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure

Endocrinologic issues: Diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, progesterone deficiency

Genetics: Osteogenesis imperfecta type II; this is severe and lethal; infants present with multiple fractures and die in utero or shortly after birth.

Other: Maternal trauma, ↑ maternal age, infection, dietary deficiencies

Environmental factors: Tobacco, alcohol, excessive caffeine (>500 mg/day), toxins, drugs, radiation

Fetal factors:

Anatomic malformation Chromosomal abnormalities: A factor in approximately 50% of spontaneous

abortions (SABs) in the first trimester, 20% to 30% in second-trimester losses, and 5% to 10% in third-trimester losses

Recurrent SAB: Two or more consecutive SABs or three SABs in 1 year; causes dependent on timing; determining possible causes requires karyotyping of both parents, workup of mother for hypercoagulability, and evaluation of uterine anatomy

Early (<12 weeks): Chromosomal abnormalities likely cause Late (12–20 weeks): Hypercoagulable states (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic

lupus erythematosus [SLE], factor V Leiden, protein S deficiency), cervical insufficiency

If antiphospholipid antibodies are detected, false ⊕ Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and falsely prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may be seen. Low- molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin provide prophylaxis against recurrent SAB.

History/PE SAB can be categorized by visual examination of the cervical os (open vs closed) and the presence or status of the fetus and products of conception. See Table 2.10-8 for types of SAB.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis by clinical presentation and physical examination Nonviable pregnancy: Gestational sac >25 mm without a fetal pole or absence of fetal

cardiac activity when CRL >7 mm on transvaginal ultrasonography

Best initial test: Ultrasonography can identify the following:

Gestational sac 5 to 6 weeks from the LMP Fetal pole at 6 weeks Fetal cardiac activity at 6 to 7 weeks

Next best test: Serum β-hCG

Treatment See Table 2.10-8 for treatment specific to the type of SAB. Administer Rh immune globulin if the mother is Rh ⊖.
======================================
ELECTIVE TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

It has been estimated that 50% of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. About 25% of all pregnancies end in elective abortion. Options for elective abortion depend on GA and patient preference (see Table 2.10-9).

KEY FACT

If fever, vomiting, purulent discharge, and/or hemodynamic instability are seen after a spontaneous or elective abortion, septic abortion should be suspected. This is a medical emergency that requires broad-spectrum antibiotics and immediate surgery to remove infected tissue.

COMPLICATIONS OF ABORTION

Septic abortion Retained products of conception → disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Endometritis

The I’s are open. Findings in cervical exam during SAB: Inevitable and Incomplete show open os.

MATERNAL COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY

HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM

Persistent vomiting not related to other causes, leading to starvation ketosis and weight loss (usually at least a 5% ↓ from prepregnancy weight). More common in first pregnancies, multiple gestations, and molar pregnancies ↑ β-hCG and ↑ estradiol have been implicated in pathophysiology

History/PE Distinguished from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) by severity (presence of weight loss and ketosis) and timing. Acid reflux, gastroenteritis, hyperthyroidism, and neurologic conditions can also cause NVP and should be on the differential diagnosis.
======================================
KEY FACT

US in a pregnant patient evaluation for

Rule out trophoblastic disease with US in a pregnant patient who presents with severe nausea and vomiting.

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis. Best initial test: Ultrasonography; evaluation for trophoblastic disease or multiple

gestation.

Evaluation for electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia), abnormal liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase.

Wernicke encephalopathy from vitamin B1 deficiency possible in severe cases. The physician can look for gait ataxia and oculomotor dysfunction.

Treatment Best initial treatment:

Dietary changes and doxylamine-pyridoxine If no response, discontinue doxylamine-pyridoxine and use metoclopramide,

promethazine, or prochlorperazine

Consider ondansetron if vomiting is not resolved with treatments mentioned earlier If dehydrated, administration of IV fluids, IV nutritional supplementation, and ondansetron

DIABETES

Diabetes in pregnancy is divided into the following two categories: pregestational DM and gestational DM.

Pregestational DM: Onset before pregnancy (Type 1 or Type 2 DM) Gestational DM: Onset during pregnancy

Consider early screening (fasting glucose, first-trimester HbA1c, or early glucose

tolerence test) for the following risk factors: Overweight or obese (BMI >25) Physical inactivity First-degree relative with DM Have previously given birth to an infant weighing 4000 g (approximately 9 lb) or more Previous gestational DM Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥5.7%, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose

on previous testing

History of cardiovascular disease Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (eg, metabolic syndrome,

acanthosis nigricans)

Pregestational Diabetes Observed in 1% of all pregnancies. Insulin requirements may ↑ as much as threefold. Poorly controlled DM is associated with an ↑ risk for congenital malformations, fetal loss, and maternal/fetal morbidity during labor and delivery.

and delivery. is >8%, look for
======================================
KEY FACT

Greater than 8, investigate! If HbA1c is >8%, look for congenital abnormalities.

Testing and Treatment Mother: Renal, ophthalmologic, and cardiac evaluation to assess for end-organ damage. Best initial treatment: Lifestyle modification with diet and exercise. Addition of insulin

therapy if poor response.

Strict glucose control is important to minimize fetal defects:

Fasting morning: ≤95 mg/dL 2-hour postprandial: <120 mg/dL

Delivery and postpartum:

Maintain normoglycemia (80–100 mg/dL) during labor with an IV insulin drip and hourly glucose measurements.

Consider delivery in the setting of poor maternal glucose control, preeclampsia, macrosomia, or evidence of fetal lung maturity (preferably after 32 weeks). Consider C-section in the setting of an estimated fetal weight (EFW) >4500 g.

Fetus: 16–24 weeks:

Ultrasonography to determine fetal anatomy (18–20 weeks)

32–34 weeks:

Antepartum fetal surveillance (eg, nonstress test [NST], contraction stress test [CST], biophysical profile [BPP]) if poor glucose control or small vessel disease

Hospitalization if maternal DM has been poorly controlled or fetal parameters are a concern

Serial ultrasonograms for fetal growth

KEY FACT

Hyperglycemia in the first trimester suggests preexisting DM and should be managed as pregestational DM.

Complications Pregestational DM is a risk factor for a variety of antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum maternal and fetal complications (Table 2.10-10). Tight glycemic control is the best way to prevent these complications

Gestational Diabetes Carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity first diagnosed during pregnancy. Occurs in 3% to 5% of all pregnancies and is usually diagnosed in the second trimester (24–28 weeks).

History/PE Typically asymptomatic May present with edema, polyhydramnios, or a large-for-gestational-age infant (>90th

percentile)

Diagnosis Best initial test: Routine screening with a 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge test

Venous plasma glucose measured 1 hour later Performed at 24 to 28 weeks Values ≥140 mg/dL considered abnormal

Confirmation with an oral 3-hour (100-g) glucose tolerance test (GTT; next test if ⊕ screening test) showing any two of the following:

Fasting: >95 mg/dL 1 hour: >180 mg/dL 2 hours: >155 mg/dL 3 hours: >140 mg/dL

Treatment Mother: Best initial treatment: American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet, regular exercise, and

strict glucose monitoring (four times per day).

Insulin is the gold standard if dietary control is insufficient. Tight maternal glucose control (fasting ≤95 mg/dL; 1 hour postprandial ≤140 mg/dL; 2 hours postprandial ≤120 mg/dL) improves outcomes.

Intrapartum insulin and dextrose to maintain tight control during delivery. Fetus: Periodic ultrasonography and NSTs to assess fetal growth and well-being Recommended induction of labor at 39 to 40 weeks in patients with gestational diabetes

controlled on insulin
======================================
KEY FACT

Keys to the management of gestational diabetes: (1) ADA diet, (2) insulin if needed, (3) ultrasonography for fetal growth, and (4) antepartum surveillance if requiring insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent.

diabetes: (1) ADA and (4) antepartum gestationaldiabetes develop postpartum, the physician 3 if normal

Complications More than 50% of patients with gestational diabetes develop glucose intolerance and/or type 2 DM later in life. At 6 to 12 weeks postpartum, the physician should screen for DM (75-g 2- hour GTT) and repeat testing every 3 years if normal results.

HYPERTENSIVE DISEASE IN PREGNANCY

Chronic and Gestational Hypertension Defined as follows: Chronic hypertension:

Presents before conception or at <20 weeks Can be diagnosed postpartum if increased blood pressure (BP) persists for >12 weeks

postpartum

Possibility for up to one third of patients with chronic hypertension to develop superimposed preeclampsia

Gestational hypertension:

Idiopathic hypertension (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg measured twice >4 hours apart) without significant proteinuria (<300 mg/L)

Develops at ≥20 weeks Possibility for up to 25% of patients with gestational hypertension to develop

preeclampsia

Must normalize within 12 weeks after pregnancy

Treatment Close monitoring of BP Best initial treatment: Treatment with appropriate antihypertensives (eg, methyldopa,

labetalol, nifedipine)

If systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥110 mm Hg, this is a hypertensive crisis that calls for labetalol, hydralazine, or nifedipine because of short onset of action

The patient should not take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or diuretics ACE inhibitors are known to lead to uterine ischemia and fetal renal damage/defects Diuretics can aggravate low plasma volume to the point of uterine ischemia

Complications Similar to those of preeclampsia (see next).

Preeclampsia New-onset hypertension (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg) and

proteinuria (>300 mg of protein in a 24-hour period or elevated urine or protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 or more) occurring at >20 weeks gestation up to 6 weeks postdelivery

Preeclampsia with severe features defined as new-onset hypertension with new onset of any of the following features (with or without proteinuria):

Platelet count <100,000/μL Serum creatinine >1.1 mg/dL or doubling of creatinine concentration in the absence of

other renal disease

or doubling of twice the upper limit of to medication and severe preeclampsia

Liver transaminases at least twice the upper limit of normal Pulmonary edema Neurologic or visual symptoms New-onset headache unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternative

diagnoses

HELLP syndrome: A variant of severe preeclampsia with severe features Consists of hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. Etiology unknown. Clinical manifestations are explained by vasospasm leading to

distention of hepatic capsule, hemorrhage, and organ necrosis.

Risk factors: Nulliparity, extremes of age (<20 or >35 years), multiple gestation, molar pregnancy, renal disease (caused by SLE or type 1 DM), a family history of preeclampsia, and chronic hypertension.

Treatment Recommend low dose aspirin daily during pregnancy Delivery of the fetus is the only cure for preeclampsia. Close-to-term or worsening preeclampsia: Induce delivery with IV oxytocin,

prostaglandin, or amniotomy.

Delivery should occur no later than 37 weeks.

Far from term (<34 weeks): Provide expectant management with close surveillance; hospital admission for uncontrolled severe-range blood pressures.

Prevent intrapartum seizures with a continuous magnesium sulfate drip.

Continue seizure prophylaxis for 24 hours postpartum. Treat magnesium toxicity with IV calcium gluconate.

Preeclampsia with severe features:

Control BP with labetalol and/or hydralazine (goal <160/110 mm Hg with a diastolic BP of 90–100 mm Hg to maintain fetal blood flow)

Provide a continuous magnesium sulfate drip Deliver by induction or C-section once term

KEY FACT

Watch for signs of magnesium toxicity (loss of deep tendon reflexes [DTRs], respiratory paralysis, coma).

Complications Prematurity, fetal distress, stillbirth, placental abruption, seizure, DIC, cerebral hemorrhage, serous retinal detachment, and fetal/maternal death.

Q

A 36-year-old G1P0 woman with a history of SLE at 36 weeks presents with headache and RUQ pain. She is admitted and found to have BPs of 165/100 and 170/105 mm Hg when tested twice 6 hours apart. She has 3+ protein on urine dipstick. Once her BP has been controlled with labetalol, what are the next steps in management?

Initiate emergent delivery once the patient is stable and convulsions are controlled Postpartum management is the same as that for preeclampsia Seizures may occur antepartum (25%), intrapartum (50%), or postpartum (25%); most

occur within 48 hours after delivery
======================================
Complications Cerebral hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, hypoxic encephalopathy, thromboembolic events, and fetal/maternal death.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION AND ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA

Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in up to 7% of pregnant patients, and 30% to 40% will subsequently develop cystitis or pyelonephritis if untreated. Persistent untreated bacteriuria places the patient at a higher risk for preterm labor, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality. Escherichia coli is responsible for 70% to 90% of infections.

History/PE Asymptomatic bacteriuria: Screening 12 to 16 weeks, ⊕ urine culture on first-trimester

screen (≥105 colony-forming units [CFUs])

Urinary tract infection (UTI): Dysuria, urinary urgency, and frequency Pyelonephritis: Same as UTI + fever and costovertebral angle tenderness

Diagnosis Best initial test: Urinalysis and ⊕ urine culture

Treatment Asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI: 3 to 7 days nitrofurantoin (avoid in first trimester if possible), cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or fosfomycin. No fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX in first or third trimester. Do a follow-up culture at 1 week as test of cure. Pyelonephritis: Admittance to hospital, IV fluids, IV third-generation cephalosporins, suppressive antibiotics based on culture susceptibility for remainder of pregnancy, and follow-up culture for test of cure.

The patient has preeclampsia with severe features. The next steps in management are to start a magnesium sulfate drip for seizure prophylaxis, give antihypertensive medications, and deliver by induction or C-section. The physician should check for end-organ involvement with labs (platelets, liver enzymes, and creatinine).

INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS

Symptoms: Maternal pruritis, mainly on palms and soles. Can also present with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, sleep deprivation, and steatorrhea.

Labs: Raised serum bile acids (most sensitive), increased aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total/direct bilirubin (less specific).

Risk: Stillbirth, preterm delivery, and meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Management: Ursodeoxycholic acid and consideration of delivery at 36 weeks.
======================================
ACUTE FATTY LIVER IN PREGNANCY

Rare, life-threatening complication in the third trimester of pregnancy Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, RUQ/epigastric pain, fulminant liver failure, scleral icterus Labs: Aminotransferases two times normal, increased bilirubin, thrombocytopenia, DIC,

acute kidney injury, profound hypoglycemia

Management: Immediate delivery due to high fetal and maternal mortality

OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY

ECTOPIC PREGNANCY

A

Most often tubal (95%), but can be abdominal, ovarian, or cervical

History/PE Presents with unilateral lower abdominal pain and vaginal spotting/bleeding, although

some patients are asymptomatic

Associated with etiologies that cause damage to the fallopian tubes, including a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pelvic surgery, DES use, or endometriosis

Differential diagnosis includes SAB, ovarian torsion, PID, and ruptured ovarian cyst

Diagnosis Evaluate for ectopic pregnancy in all females of reproductive age presenting with

abdominal pain and positive pregnancy test

Best initial test: Transvaginal ultrasonogram (see Fig. 2.10-3).

FIGURE 2.10-3. Normal intrauterine pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasonograms showing (A) a normal intrauterine pregnancy with a gestational sac containing a yolk sac within the uterine cavity and (B) a complex mass (CM)/ectopic pregnancy adjacent to an empty uterus. (Reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 6th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2004.)

Next best test: Serial serum β-hCG may be used to stratify hemodynamically stable patients in whom transvaginal US is nondiagnostic:

<3500 IU/L → serial β-hCG until levels reach 3500 IU/L (which is when an intrauterine pregnancy should be seen)

Levels in viable intrauterine pregnancy usually rise 50% to 100% in 48 hours

>3500 IU/L → repeat β-hCG and US in 2 days

MNEMONIC

These symptoms PAVE the way for a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy— Pain (abdominal) Amenorrhea OR Vaginal bleeding Ectopic pregnancy

Treatment Medical treatment (methotrexate) is sufficient for small, unruptured tubal pregnancies. Surgical options include salpingectomy or salpingostomy with evacuation (laparoscopy vs

laparotomy).
======================================
KEY FACT

Unstable patients or those with signs of peritoneal irritation (eg, rebound tenderness) require emergent surgical intervention regardless of US findings and hCG levels.

Complications Tubal rupture and hemoperitoneum (a surgical emergency).

DISEASE abnormalities that disease (GTD): It Moles

GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE

A range of proliferative trophoblastic abnormalities that can be benign or malignant Benign gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD): It includes complete and partial molar

pregnancies (see Table 2.10-12).

TABLE 2.10-12. Complete vs Partial Moles

VARIABLE COMPLETE PARTIAL Mechanism Sperm fertilization of an empty Normal ovum fertilized by two ovum sperm Karyotype 46,XX 69,XXY Fetal tissue No fetal tissue Contains fetal tissue

Malignant GTD: Molar pregnancy may progress to malignant GTD, including the following:

Invasive hydatidiform moles (10%–15%) Choriocarcinoma (2%–5%)

Complications of malignant GTD include pulmonary or CNS metastases and trophoblastic pulmonary emboli.

History/PE GTD presents with first-trimester uterine bleeding, hyperemesis gravidarum, preeclampsia/eclampsia at <24 weeks, and uterine size greater than dates.

Risk factors include extremes of age (<20 or >40 years) and a diet deficient in folate or β- carotene.

Diagnosis Initial test: Pelvic examination may reveal enlarged ovaries (bilateral theca-lutein cysts)

or expulsion of grapelike molar clusters into the vagina.

Next best/most accurate test: Pelvic ultrasonography reveals a “snowstorm” appearance with no gestational sac or fetus present (see Fig. 2.10-4).

FIGURE 2.10-4. Molar pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasonogram shows a large, complex intrauterine mass with cystic regions that have the characteristic appearance of grapes, also known as “snowstorm” appearance.

Labs show markedly ↑ serum β-hCG (usually >100,000 mIU/mL). X-ray of the chest (CXR) may show lung metastases. D&C reveals “cluster-of-grapes” tissue.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Evacuate the uterus with D&C. Follow with weekly β-hCG to undetectable (or negative) weekly, and then monthly for 6

months. Contraception for at least 6 months.

Treat malignant disease with chemotherapy (methotrexate or dactinomycin). Treat residual uterine disease with hysterectomy. Chemotherapy and irradiation are highly effective for metastases.

Other causes: Other forms of abnormal placentation (see later), ruptured uterus, genital tract lesions, and trauma

Abnormal placental implantation (Figs. 2.10-5 and 2.10-6) results from an abnormality of the decidua basalis and is an important risk factor for postpartum maternal hemorrhage.
======================================
Placenta accreta: Abnormal implantation of the placenta such that the placental vili are attached to the myometrium.

Placenta increta: Abnormal implantation of the placenta such that the placental vili penetrate into the myometrium

Placenta percreta: Abnormal implantation of the placenta such that the placental villi penetrate through the myometrium and into the serosa.

Risk factors: Prior uterine incisions (C-section, fibroid removal), low-lying placentation, placenta previa, fetal Down syndrome

Complications: Maternal hemorrhage, fetal asphyxiation, death.

KEY FACT

MULTIPLE GESTATION

Affects 3% of all live births. Since 1980, the incidence of monozygotic (identical) twins has remained steady, whereas the incidence of dizygotic (fraternal) and higher-order births has ↑.

History/PE Characterized by rapid uterine growth, excessive maternal weight gain, and palpation of three or more large fetal parts on Leopold maneuvers.

Diagnosis Ultrasonography β-hCG, human placental lactogen, and MSAFP elevated for GA

and MSAFP fetal termination options FGR

Treatment Multifetal reduction and selective fetal termination options for higher-order multiple

pregnancies

Antepartum fetal surveillance for FGR

Complications Maternal: Patients six times more likely to be hospitalized with complications of

pregnancy. ↑ incidence of placenta previa and need for C-section delivery.

Fetal: Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (most common in monochorionic twins), cord entanglement (commonly in monoamniotic twins), FGR, preterm labor, and ↑ incidence of congenital malformations.

FETAL GROWTH RESTRICTION

History/PE Risk factors include: Maternal systemic disease leading to uteroplacental insufficiency (intrauterine infection,

Maternal systemic disease leading to uteroplacental insufficiency (intrauterine infection, hypertension, anemia).

hypertension, anemia). Maternal substance use. Placenta previa. Multiple gestation. Symmetric FGR results from aneuploidy, congenital anomalies, and intrauterine infection.

This usually occurs in the first trimester.

Asymmetric FGR (“head-sparing growth lag”) results from uteroplacental insufficiency,

maternal hypertension, or other maternal chronic disease. This usually occurs in the second/third trimester.

Diagnosis Best initial test: US to confirm GA and fetal weight. Antepartum serial fundal height measurements with ultrasonography and weekly

biophysical profiles; umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry.

Treatment Explore the underlying etiology and correct if possible. If the patient is near due date, administer steroids (eg, betamethasone) to accelerate fetal

lung maturity; this treatment is required 48 hours before delivery.

Perform antepartum fetal monitoring. A nonreassuring status near term may prompt delivery.

Complications ↑ perinatal morbidity and mortality.

common sequela of fetal size the newborn at birth

Diagnosis Best initial test: US to estimate fetal size Most accurate test: Weighing the newborn at birth (prenatal diagnosis is imprecise)

Treatment Consideration of planned C-section delivery for an EFW >5000 g in a pregnant patient without DM and for an EFW >4500 g in a pregnant patient with DM.

Complications ↑ risk for shoulder dystocia (leading to brachial plexus injury and Erb-Duchenne palsy) as birth weight ↑.

POLYHYDRAMNIOS

An amniotic fluid index (AFI) ≥24 or single deepest pocket ≥8 cm on ultrasonography. May be present in normal pregnancies, but fetal chromosomal developmental abnormalities must be considered.

Etiologies Maternal DM Multiple gestation Isoimmunization Pulmonary abnormalities (eg, cystic lung malformations) Fetal gastrointestinal (GI) tract anomalies (eg, duodenal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula,

anencephaly)

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome

History/PE Usually asymptomatic.

Diagnosis Sonographic documentation of excessive amniotic fluid volume defined as an AFI greater than or equal to (symbol) 24 cm or a single deepest pocket greater than or equal to (symbol) 8 cm. Additional evaluation should include ultrasonography for fetal anomalies, glucose testing for DM, and Rh screen. May note fundal height greater than expected for GA.

Treatment Therapeutic serial amniocentesis to remove fluid for severe symptomatic polyhydramnios with shortness of breath; treatment of underlying cause if possible

Complications Preterm labor, fetal malpresentation, cord prolapse

OLIGOHYDRAMNIOS

Diagnosis The sum of the deepest amniotic fluid pocket in all four abdominal quadrants on ultrasonography.

Treatment Rule out rupture of membranes. Treat the underlying cause if possible.

Complications Associated with a 40-fold ↑ in perinatal mortality Other complications: Musculoskeletal abnormalities (eg, clubfoot, facial distortion),

pulmonary hypoplasia, umbilical cord compression, and FGR
======================================
RH ISOIMMUNIZATION

Fetal RBCs leak into the maternal circulation, and maternal anti-Rh IgG antibodies form that can cross the placenta, leading to hemolysis of fetal Rh⊕ RBCs (erythroblastosis fetalis; see Fig. 2.10-7). Rh isoimmunization occurs only in Rh⊖ women; ↑ risk with previous SAB or

Treatment In severe cases, the physician should initiate preterm delivery. Before delivery, intrauterine blood transfusions can be given to correct a low fetal hematocrit.

Prevention If the patient is Rh⊖ and the other parent is Rh⊕ (or the status is unknown), give Rh

immune globulin at 28 weeks.

If the baby is Rh⊕, give the mother Rh immune globulin postpartum. The dose is based on the Kleihauer-Betke test. Inadequate dosing can lead to alloimmunization.

Give Rh immune globulin to Rh⊖ mothers who undergo abortion or who have had an ectopic pregnancy, amniocentesis, vaginal bleeding, or placenta previa/placental abruption. Type and screening are critical.

Complications Hydrops fetalis when fetal hemoglobin is <7 g/dL Fetal hypoxia and acidosis, kernicterus, prematurity, death
======================================
ANTEPARTUM FETAL SURVEILLANCE

In general, antepartum fetal surveillance should occur in pregnancies in which the risk for antepartum fetal demise is ↑. Testing is initiated in most at-risk pregnant patients at 32 to 34 weeks (or 26–28 weeks if there are multiple worrisome risk factors). The following assessments take place:

Fetal movement assessment:

Assessed by mother as the number of fetal movements over 1 hour On average, 2 hours required for a mother to register 10 fetal movements Maternal reports of ↓ fetal movements should be evaluated by means of various tests

DEFINITION AND STAGES OF LABOR

Labor is the process whereby contractions of the uterus are accompanied by progressive effacement (thinning) and dilation of the cervix, resulting in delivery of the fetus and placenta through the birth canal (Table 2.10-17).

TABLE 2.10-17. Stages of Labor

KEY FACT

Braxton Hicks contractions: Irregular low-intensity contractions of the uterus without effacement or dilation of cervix.

OBSTETRIC EXAMINATION

Leopold maneuvers are used to determine fetal lie (longitudinal or transverse) and, if possible, fetal presentation (breech or cephalic).

Cervical exam:

Evaluate dilation, effacement, station, cervical position, and cervical consistency. Confirm or determine fetal presentation. Determine fetal position through palpation of the fetal sutures and fontanelles. Conduct a sterile speculum exam if rupture of membranes (ROM) is suspected.

Determine station or engagement of the fetal head relative to a line through the ischial spines of the maternal pelvis. ⊖ station = fetal head superior to this line; ⊕ station = fetal head inferior to this line.

Oxytocin and misoprostol are often used as aids in the delivery process (for contraction augmentation and cervical softening).
======================================
Adverse Effects of Oxytocin:

Hyponatremia Tachysystole Hypotension

FETAL HEART RATE MONITORING

Monitoring can be performed noninvasively with Doppler US or invasively with an electrode attached to the fetal scalp (a method that yields more precise results but can only be used with ruptured membranes).

Continuous electronic FHR monitoring has not been shown to be more effective than appropriate intermittent monitoring in low-risk patients.

Components of FHR evaluation Rate (normal = 110–160 bpm):

FHR <110 bpm: Bradycardia. Can be caused by congenital heart malformations or by severe hypoxia (secondary to uterine hyperstimulation, cord prolapse, or rapid fetal descent).

Can be caused by uterine hyperstimulation, Causes include hypoxia, baseline FHR that are cerebral.activity. severe fetal acidemia.

FHR >160 bpm: Tachycardia. Causes include hypoxia, maternal fever, intra-amniotic infection, and fetal anemia.

Variability: Fluctuations in the baseline FHR that are irregular in frequency and amplitude. Related to fetal cerebral activity.

Absent variability: Indicates severe fetal acidemia. Minimal variability: <6 bpm. Indicates fetal hypoxia or the effects of opioids,

magnesium, or sleep cycle.

Normal variability: 6 to 25 bpm. Marked variability: >25 bpm. May indicate fetal hypoxia; may occur before a ↓ in

variability.

Sinusoidal variability: Concerning for serious fetal anemia; a pseudo-sinusoidal pattern may also occur during maternal meperidine use.

Accelerations: Onset of an ↑ in FHR >15 beats above baseline to a peak in <30 seconds. Reassuring because they indicate proper function of fetal autonomic nervous system.

Decelerations: See Table 2.10-18.

VEAL CHOP Variable deceleration = Cord compression Early deceleration = Head compression Accelerations = OK! Late deceleration = Placental insufficiency Note: Interventions include maternal repositioning, amnioinfusion, or delivery.

OBSTETRIC ANALGESIA AND ANESTHESIA

Uterine contractions and cervical dilation result in visceral pain (T10–L1). Descent of the fetal head and pressure on the vagina and perineum result in somatic pain (pudendal nerve [S2–4]). Pudendal block:

Bilateral transvaginal injection of local anesthetic in and around pudendal nerve as it passes around ischial spine

Provides perineal anesthesia; can be used in second stage of labor

Epidural block:

Injection of local anesthetic in epidural space that blocks lumbosacral nerve roots Can be used for either vaginal delivery or C-section

Complications Transient hypotension from sympathetic blockade is a common complication and does not

require treatment unless there are signs of shock.

Spinal headache is another common complication if there is a dural puncture. Epidural anesthesia can cause postpartum urinary retention. Urethral catheterization is

diagnostic and therapeutic.

Absolute contraindications to regional anesthesia (epidural, spinal, or combination) include the following:

Refractory maternal hypotension Maternal coagulopathy Maternal use of a once-daily dose of low-molecular-weight heparin within 12 hours Untreated maternal bacteremia Skin infection over the site of needle placement ↑ ICP caused by a mass lesion

ABNORMAL LABOR AND DELIVERY

For both elective and blockers, or PPIs should aspiration syndrome.

INDICATIONS FOR C-SECTION

See Table 2.10-19 for indications. For both elective and indicated C-section deliveries, an agent such as sodium citrate, H2 blockers, or PPIs should be used in the pregnant patient to ↓ gastric acidity and prevent acid aspiration syndrome.

PRETERM LABOR

Onset of labor between 20 and 37 weeks. The primary cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include previous preterm delivery (greatest risk factor), multiple gestation,

Risk factors include previous preterm delivery (greatest risk factor), multiple gestation, infection, ROM, uterine anomalies (eg, prior surgery, bicornuate uterus), polyhydramnios, placental abruption, poor maternal nutrition, and low socioeconomic status (SES).

infection, ROM, uterine anomalies (eg, prior surgery, bicornuate uterus), polyhydramnios, placental abruption, poor maternal nutrition, and low socioeconomic status (SES). Patients found to have a short cervix at <24 weeks are at high risk for preterm labor. Most patients have no identifiable risk factors.

KEY FACT

Preterm labor = Regular uterine contractions + concurrent cervical change at <37 weeks.

History/PE Presents with menstrual-like cramps, onset of low back pain, pelvic pressure, and new vaginal discharge or bleeding.

Diagnosis Requires the following:

Regular uterine contractions (three or more contractions of 30 seconds each over a 30- minute period)

Concurrent cervical change at <37 weeks

Assessment for contraindications to tocolysis such as infection, nonreassuring fetal testing, and/or placental abruption

Sterile speculum exam to rule out ROM Ultrasonography to rule out fetal or uterine anomalies, verify GA, and assess fetal

presentation and amniotic fluid volume

Cultures for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and group B streptococcus (GBS); also, a urinalysis (UA) and urine culture

MgSO,, calcium channel unless.contraindicated prophylaxis if <32 weeks maturity prophylaxis if preterm

Treatment Tocolytic therapy (β-agonists, MgSO4, calcium channel blockers [CCBs], prostaglandin

inhibitors) if <34 weeks’ gestation, unless contraindicated

Magnesium for cerebral palsy prophylaxis if <32 weeks Steroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity Penicillin or ampicillin for GBS prophylaxis if preterm delivery likely

Complications Respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, apnea of prematurity, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and death.
======================================
RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES

Distinguished as follows: Spontaneous ROM: Occurs after or at the onset of labor. Premature ROM (PROM): Occurs >1 hour before onset of labor. This is a variant of

normal at term or may be precipitated by vaginal or cervical infections, abnormal membrane physiology, or cervical insufficient.

Preterm PROM (PPROM): ROM occurring at <37 weeks. Prolonged ROM: ROM occurring >18 hours before delivery. Risk factors: Young

maternal age, smoking, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

History/PE Patients often report a “gush” of clear or blood-tinged amniotic fluid. Uterine contractions may be present.

Diagnosis Sterile speculum examination reveals pooling of amniotic fluid in the vaginal vault. Nitrazine paper test is ⊕ (paper turns blue, indicating alkaline pH of amniotic fluid). Fern test is ⊕ (a ferning pattern is seen under a microscope after amniotic fluid dries on a

glass slide).

Ultrasonography assesses amniotic fluid volume. If diagnosis is uncertain, ultrasonography-guided transabdominal instillation of indigo

carmine dye can check for leakage (unequivocal test).

Minimize infection risk; do not perform digital vaginal examinations on pregnant patients who are not in labor or for whom labor is not planned immediately.

Check fetal heart tracing, maternal temperature, WBC count, and uterine tenderness for evidence of intrauterine infection.

KEY FACT

To minimize the risk for infection, limit digital vaginal examinations on women with PROM.

Treatment Depends on GA:

and fetal presentation, hours. may be considered. management and for signs of period in the absence

Term: First check GBS status and fetal presentation, then labor may be induced, or the patient can be observed for 6 hours.

34 to 36 weeks: Labor induction may be considered. <32 weeks: Institute expectant management and hospitalization for close observation

of fetal well-being and monitoring for signs of infection.

Antibiotics: To prolong the latency period in the absence of infection. Antenatal corticosteroids:

Give betamethasone or dexamethasone for 48 hours, which promote fetal lung maturity in the absence of intra-amniotic infection before 32 to 36 weeks.

If signs of infection or fetal distress develop, the physician should give antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) and induce labor.
======================================
Complications Preterm labor and delivery, intrauterine infection, placental abruption, and cord prolapse.

FAILURE TO PROGRESS

Associated with intrauterine infection, occiput posterior position, nulliparity, elevated birth weight, and maternal obesity.

Diagnosis First-stage protraction or arrest: Labor that fails to produce adequate rates of

progressive cervical change.

Prolonged second stage or arrest: Protraction or arrest of fetal descent. Most commonly caused by malposition. See Table 2.10-20 for definitions based on parity and anesthesia.

INTRA-AMNIOTIC INFECTION

Intrauterine infections occur via ascending polymicrobial disease from the vagina through the amnion, placenta, and uterus. Less commonly, hematogenous transplacental seeding from a specific systemic maternal infection (eg, Listeria) can also occur. The following sections refer only to ascending infections, often called chorioamnionitis. Risk factors: PPROM, prolonged rupture of membranes, prolonged labor, internal

fetal/uterine monitoring devices, repeated vaginal examinations

Complications: Postpartum hemorrhage, endometritis, preterm birth, neonatal pneumonia, and encephalopathy

Tx: Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin) and augmentation of labor
======================================
FETAL MALPRESENTATION

Any presentation other than vertex (ie, head closest to birth canal, chin to chest, occiput anterior). Risk factors include prematurity, prior breech delivery, uterine anomalies (eg, fibroids), polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, multiple gestation, PPROM, hydrocephalus, anencephaly, and placenta previa.

History/PE Breech presentations are the most common form and involve presentation of the fetal lower extremities or buttocks into the maternal pelvis (see Fig. 2.10-9). Subtypes include the following:

Frank breech Single footling breech Complete breech &

KEY FACT

common fetal malpresentation. change.to’ vertex by fetus has not reverted pressure to the maternal roughly'50%. Risks of version

Breech presentation is the most common fetal malpresentation.

Treatment Follow: Up to 75% spontaneously change to vertex by week 38. External cephalic version: If the fetus has not reverted spontaneously, a version may be attempted by applying directed pressure to the maternal abdomen to turn the infant to vertex. The success rate is roughly 50%. Risks of version are placental abruption and cord compression, so the physician should be prepared for an emergency C-section if needed.

Trial of breech vaginal delivery: Attempt trial only if delivery is imminent. Complications include cord prolapse and/or head entrapment.

Elective C-section: Recommended given the lower risk for fetal morbidity.

UMBILICAL CORD PROLAPSE

Occurs when cord presents ahead of fetal parts and protrudes through cervix. Considered an obstetric emergency. Risk factors include rupturing membranes without engaged fetal head part, malpresentation, prolonged labor, and polyhydramnios. Dx: Visualization or palpation of the umbilical cord ahead of fetal presenting part. Can be

accompanied by abrupt, severe prolonged decelerations.

Tx: Manual elevation of presenting part, call for assistance, and preparation for emergency delivery.
======================================
SHOULDER DYSTOCIA

Affects 0.6% to 1.4% of all deliveries in the United States. Risk factors include obesity, diabetes, suspected fetal macrosomia, a history of an infant with macrosomy, postterm pregnancy, and a history of prior shoulder dystocia.

Diagnosis Diagnosed by a prolonged second stage of labor, retraction of the head from the perineum (“turtle sign”).

Treatment In the event of dystocia, the following maneuvers may be attempted:

McRoberts maneuver (see Fig. 2.10-10)

(McRoberts maneuver) and the abdomen. The leg infant is at risk for shoulder dystocia through avoided:in shoulder against the pubic bone. edsNew York, NY: McGraw-Hill;

FIGURE 2.10-10. Leg elevation (McRoberts maneuver) and application of suprapubic pressure. Flexing the hips against the abdomen. The leg positioning illustrated here can be used to assist in a delivery where the infant is at risk for shoulder dystocia. Suprapubic pressure may cause reduction of a shoulder dystocia through adduction of the anterior shoulder. Fundal pressure should be avoided in shoulder dystocia as it may cause further impaction of the anterior shoulder against the pubic bone. (Reproduced with permission from Cunningham FG et al. Williams Obstetrics, 23rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

Application of suprapubic pressure (Fig. 2.10-10) Internal rotational maneuvers: Used if external maneuvers have failed to reduce the dystocia. These maneuvers reduce the diameter of the fetal shoulder girdle through abduction of the anterior shoulder toward the fetal back (Woods screw) or adduction of the anterior shoulder toward the fetal chest (Rubin) by the fingers of one hand introduced intravaginally. Delivery of posterior arm Intentional fracture of fetal clavicle Procto-episiotomy Zavanelli maneuver (manually pushing delivered fetal head into uterus and taking

patient for C-section)

Excessive traction on the fetal head to deliver the anterior shoulder can result in “stretch” injuries to the C8 to T1 brachial plexus, including Horner syndrome, Erb-Duchenne palsy, or Klumpke palsy. These brachial plexus injuries usually resolve spontaneously.
======================================
EPISIOTOMY

Surgical extension of the vaginal opening into the perineum. Can be median (midline) or mediolateral.

Complications Extension to the anal sphincter (third degree) or rectum (fourth degree): More

common with midline episiotomy

Others: Bleeding, infection, dyspareunia, rectovaginal fistula formation Routine use of episiotomy not recommended

UTERINE INVERSION

An uncommon cause of postpartum hemorrhage. This occurs when the uterine fundus prolapses through the cervix and vagina and can often be visible as a shaggy mass protruding from the vagina. The fundus is no longer palpable, and the patient is usually experiencing severe abdominal pain. Causes include excessive fundal pressure and traction on the umbilical cord. Treatment involves discontinuation of uterotonics, manually replacing the uterus, and monitoring hemodynamic status.

UTERINE RUPTURE

Very rare but life-threatening complication that may occur in pregnant patients with a history of C-section (especially vertical C-section) or other uterine surgeries. May result in postpartum bleeding. Loss of fetal station is pathognomonic for this condition, and fetal parts may be palpable in the abdomen but not in the vagina. Treatment involves emergent laparotomy.

not in the vagina. include’lochia (vaginal

PUERPERIUM

Normal changes after delivery include lochia (vaginal bleeding), uterine contraction, and uterine involution.

The superficial layers of the endometrial decidua shed through the vagina for the first 3 postpartum weeks. This is called lochia.

For the first few days, lochia is red in color (lochia rubra), and then it changes to pink in color (lochia serosa). Lochia changes to white color (lochia alba) by the end of the second week.

Postpartum urinary retention is also common, and it is caused by bladder atony. This can be managed with catheterization and encouragement of ambulation, and it usually resolves spontaneously.

Radiating suprapubic pain exacerbated by weight-bearing may occur because of diastasis of the pubic symphysis (separation of the pubic bones). This is more common after a traumatic delivery, and treatment is with supportive care.
======================================
POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE

======================================
POSTPARTUM INFECTION

A temperature ≥38°C for at least 2 of the first 10 postpartum days (not including the first 24 hours). Risk factors for postpartum endometritis: Emergent C-section, PROM, prolonged labor, multiple intrapartum vaginal exams, intrauterine manipulations, emergent delivery, low SES, young age, invasive fetal monitoring, prolonged ROM, bacterial colonization, and corticosteroid use.

KEY FACT

Postpartum endometritis: Fever >38°C Uterine tenderness Malodorous lochia

Dx: Diagnose with blood cultures and CT, looking for a pelvic abscess. Tx: Broad-spectrum antibiotics and anticoagulation with heparin for 7 to 10 days.

Treatment Broad-spectrum empiric IV antibiotics (eg, clindamycin and gentamicin) until patient has been afebrile for 48 hours (24 hours for intrauterine infections). Add ampicillin for complicated cases.

Complications Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis: Pelvic infection leads to infection of the vein wall and intimal damage, leading in turn to

thrombogenesis. The clot is then invaded by microorganisms.

Suppuration follows, with liquefaction, fragmentation, and, finally, septic embolization. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis presents with abdominal and back pain and a “picket- fence” fever curve (“hectic” fevers) with wide swings from normal to as high as 41°C (105.8°F) that does not resolve despite antibiotic treatment.

The physician should diagnose with blood cultures and CT, looking for a pelvic abscess. Treatment calls for broad-spectrum antibiotics and anticoagulation with heparin for 7 to 10

days.

Pituitary ischemia and necrosis that lead to anterior pituitary insufficiency secondary to massive obstetric hemorrhage and shock

History/PE The primary cause of anterior pituitary insufficiency in adult females Most common presenting symptom: Failure to lactate (caused by ↓ prolactin levels) Other symptoms: Hypotension, weakness, lethargy, cold intolerance, genital atrophy, and

menstrual disorders

Diagnosis

Best initial test: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test Most accurate test: MRI of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus to rule out tumor or

other pathology

Treatment Replacement of all deficient hormones. Some patients may recover thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and even gonadotropin function after cortisol replacement alone.

LACTATION AND BREASTFEEDING

PHYSIOLOGY

During pregnancy, ↑ estrogen and progesterone result in breast hypertrophy and inhibition of the action of prolactin on the breast.

After delivery of the placenta, hormone levels ↓ markedly, and prolactin stimulates the alveolar epithelial cells, activating milk production. ↑ prolactin will ↓ luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), causing anovulation and amenorrhea during breastfeeding.

Periodic infant suckling leads to further release of prolactin and oxytocin. Oxytocin stimulates myoepithelial cell contraction and milk ejection (“let-down reflex”) and promotes greater involution of the uterus postpartum (Fig. 2.10-11).

Posterior pituitary Anterior pituitary Suckling at lactating breast Oxytocin LS a® td Contraction of myoepithelial cells

FIGURE 2.10-11. Physiology of breastmilk production. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

Colostrum (early breast milk) contains protein, fat, secretory IgA, and minerals. Within 1 week postpartum, mature milk with protein, fat, lactose, and water is produced. High IgA levels in colostrum provide passive immunity for the infant and protect against

enteric bacteria.

Other potential benefits of breastfeeding include the following:

↓ incidence of infant allergies ↓ incidence of early infant upper respiratory infections (URIs) and GI infections Facilitation of mother-child bonding Maternal weight loss

Females who desire to suppress lactation should wear a supportive bra, avoid nipple stimulation, apply ice packs to the breasts, and use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce pain. Breast binding should be avoided, as it ↑ risk for mastitis.
======================================
CONTRAINDICATIONS TO BREASTFEEDING

Breastfeeding has many benefits and should be encouraged when possible. Contraindications to breastfeeding are rare (see Table 2.10-22).

MASTITIS/BREAST ABSCESS

Cellulitis of the periglandular tissue caused by nipple trauma from breastfeeding coupled with the introduction of bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus, into the nipple ducts.

History/PE Symptoms often begin 2 to 4 weeks postpartum, are usually unilateral, and include: Breast tenderness Erythema, edema, warmth, and possible purulent nipple drainage Significant fever, chills, and malaise can also be seen

Diagnosis Differentiate mastitis from simple breast swelling Infection is suggested by focal symptoms, an ↑ WBC count, and fever

Treatment Continuation of breastfeeding to prevent the accumulation of infected material (or use of a

breast pump in patients who are no longer breastfeeding)

Oral antibiotics (dicloxacillin, cephalexin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin, clindamycin), antipyretics, and NSAIDs to reduce inflammation

If no clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours, evaluation with breast ultrasonography to assess for abscess; if present, treat abscess with incision and drainage

BREAST ENGORGEMENT

Occurs when milk production exceeds removal → bilateral firmness, fullness, tenderness, and warmth. Management calls for frequent breastfeeding, compresses (warm before and cold between feeds), and mild analgesics. If patient is not breastfeeding, management calls for suppression of lactation (described earlier).

NIPPLE INJURY

NORMAL MENSTRUAL CYCLE

The progression of a normal menstrual cycle is detailed here. Figure 2.11-1 shows the cyclic events in the ovary (follicular and luteal phases) and the corresponding events in the uterus (proliferative and secretory) levels throughout a typical 28-day cycle.

FIGURE 2.11-1. The phases of the ovarian and uterine cycles. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Menstruation and follicular phase (days 1–13):

Starts with menstruation and ends at luteinizing hormone (LH) surge/ovulation May vary but typically lasts ∼13 days ↑ frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse →↑ follicle-stimulating

hormone (FSH) → growth of follicles →↑ estrogen production

Results in the development of straight glands and thin secretions of the uterine lining (proliferative phase)

By late follicular phase: Dominant follicle is selected and ↑ in size; uterine endometrium has thickened; and cervical mucus is becoming copious, thin, and stretchy Ovulation (day 14):

Estradiol reaches a peak → positive feedback to the pituitary gland → LH surge (smaller FSH rise) → rupture of the ovarian follicle and release of a mature ovum → travels to oviduct/uterus

Ruptured follicular cells differentiate into the corpus luteum

KEY FACT

“LH surge” triggers ovulation and initiates production of progesterone.

Luteal phase (days 15–28):

Length of time (10–14 days) that the corpus luteum can survive without further LH or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation

Change from estrogen to progesterone predominance; corpus luteum produces progesterone and some estradiol, allowing the endometrial lining to develop thick and tortuous endometrial glands with thick secretions (secretory phase)

In the absence of fertilization and implantation, ↓ LH → ↓ progesterone and estradiol by the corpus luteum → sloughing of the endometrial lining

With ↓ estrogen and progesterone, there is no longer negative feedback to FSH, which then increases and restarts the menstruation/follicular phase
======================================
ABNORMALITIES OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY

in a child <8 years Pubertal Development PERIPHERAL Congenital

Onset of secondary sexual characteristics in a child <8 years of age. Subtypes are as follows (see Table 2.11-1):

TABLE 2.11-1. Causes of Precocious Pubertal Development

CENTRAL (GnRH DEPENDENT) PERIPHERAL (GnRH INDEPENDENT) Constitutional (idiopathic) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hypothalamic lesions (hamartomas, tumors, Adrenal tumors congenital malformations) McCune-Albright syndrome (polyostotic Dysgerminomas fibrous dysplasia) Hydrocephalus Gonadal tumors (especially a granulosa cell Central nervous system (CNS) infections tumor, which secretes estrogen) CNS trauma/irradiation Exposure to exogenous estrogen Pineal tumors (rare) Ovarian cysts (females) Neurofibromatosis with CNS involvement Hypothyroidism Tuberous sclerosis

Central precocious puberty: Early activation of hypothalamic GnRH production

KEY FACT

If onset of secondary sexual characteristics is seen before 8 years of age, work up for precocious puberty by determining bone age and conducting a GnRH stimulation test to distinguish central from peripheral precocious puberty.

Peripheral precocious puberty: Results from GnRH-independent mechanisms

KEY FACT

A patient with McCune-Albright syndrome presents with precocious puberty, café au lait spots, and bony abnormalities (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia).

History/PE Risk factors: smoking, immunosuppression, HPV infection. Signs of estrogen excess (breast development and possibly vaginal bleeding) suggest

ovarian cysts or tumors.

Signs of androgen excess (pubic and/or axillary hair, enlarged clitoris, and/or acne) suggest adrenal tumors or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

KEY FACT

Central precocious puberty: ↑ estradiol, ↑ LH, ↑ FSH Peripheral precocious puberty: ↑ estradiol, ↓ LH, ↓ FSH

includes the following: age: puberty either has age: puberty either stimulation test:

Diagnosis Workup for precocious puberty includes the following: Bone age:

Within 1 year of chronologic age: puberty either has not started or has just begun. >2 years ahead of chronologic age: puberty either started >1 year ago or recently

started with rapid progression.
======================================
GnRH agonist (leuprolide) stimulation test:

Increased LH: Central precocious puberty → CNS tumor (may be detected on MRI) vs constitutional precocious puberty.

No increase in LH: Peripheral precocious puberty → ovarian cyst/adrenal or gonadal tumor (may be detected on ovarian, gonadal, and/or adrenal ultrasound) vs exogenous estrogen or CAH.

Treatment Central precocious puberty: Leuprolide is first-line therapy; physical changes regress or

cease to progress.

Peripheral precocious puberty: The physician should treat the cause.

Ovarian cysts: No intervention is necessary, as cysts will usually regress spontaneously.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): Treatment with glucocorticoids. Depending on the enzyme deficiency, mineralocorticoid and sodium chloride supplementation may be necessary.

Adrenal or ovarian tumors: These require surgical resection. McCune-Albright syndrome: Estrogen blockers such as tamoxifen or drugs that decrease estrogen synthesis such as aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole) or other synthesis blockers (ketoconazole or testolactone) may be effective.

PRIMARY AMENORRHEA/DELAYED PUBERTY

Primary amenorrhea is the absence of menses by 15 years of age with secondary sexual development present. Delayed puberty is the absence of secondary sexual characteristics by 13 years of age.

History/PE Absence of secondary sexual characteristics (no estrogen production):

Primary ovarian insufficiency: Most common cause (∼50%). Depletion of ovarian follicles and oocytes most commonly from Turner syndrome (45,XO). The physician should consider a history of radiation therapy and chemotherapy or gonadal dysgenesis. Central hypogonadism: Can be caused by a variety of factors, including the following:

Undernourishment, stress, hyperprolactinemia, or exercise Central nervous system (CNS) tumor (consider prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma if

galactorrhea) or cranial irradiation

Kallmann syndrome (isolated gonadotropin deficiency) associated with anosmia Constitutional growth delay

Presence of secondary sexual characteristics (estrogen production but other anatomic or

genetic problems): Etiologies include the following: Müllerian agenesis: XX genotype with normal female testosterone levels. Absence of

upper two thirds of the vagina; uterine abnormalities

with normal female uterine abnormalities with hematocolpos (blood hymen XY genotype with (aromatization of with amenorrhea or

Imperforate hymen: Presents with hematocolpos (blood in the vagina) that cannot escape, along with a bulging hymen

Complete androgen insensitivity: XY genotype with elevated testosterone levels. Presents with breast development (aromatization of testosterone to estrogen) but amenorrhea and lack of pubic hair

CAH: Can present as virilization with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea; often presents in

infancy with ambiguous genitalia PE: Pubertal development, genital exam, signs of androgen excess, physical features of

Turner syndrome
======================================
KEY FACT

For Turner syndrome, think streak gonads, shield chest, amenorrhea, webbed neck, aortic coarctation, and bicuspid aortic valve.

KEY FACT

The first step in the workup of primary or secondary amenorrhea is a pregnancy test!

Diagnosis Perform pregnancy test.

Assess for anatomic abnormalities (eg, imperforate hymen): Physical examination, ultrasonography:

Uterus absent: Obtain karyotype and serum testosterone levels to assess if patient has

abnormal Müllerian development (46,XX, normal female testosterone levels) or androgen insensitivity (46,XY, normal male testosterone levels).

Uterus present: Check FSH, LH levels.

↑ FSH: Primary ovarian insufficiency. Obtain karyotype for Turner syndrome (45,XO). Normal/↓ FSH: Central hypogonadism, constitutional growth delay. Measure serum

prolactin and thyrotropin, especially if galactorrhea is present.

If signs of hyperandrogenism: Consider androgen-secreting neoplasm or CAH. Check serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS).

If hypertensive: Evaluate for CAH (17-hydroxylase and 11-hydroxylase deficiencies). See Table 2.11-2 for etiologies and Figure 2.11-2 for workup of primary amenorrhea.

Treatment Constitutional growth delay: No treatment is necessary. Hypogonadism: Begin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen alone at the lowest dose. Begin cyclic estrogen/progesterone therapy 12 to 18 months later (if the uterus is present).

Anatomic: Requires surgical intervention.
======================================
SECONDARY AMENORRHEA

The absence of menses for 6 consecutive months in females who have passed menarche. Etiologies include:

Pregnancy Ovary: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), premature ovarian insufficiency,

chemotherapy, radiation

Hypothalamus: Neoplasm, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (poor nutrition, exercise, and stress), systemic illness (type 1 diabetes mellitus [DM], celiac disease)

deepening of the voice

Defeminization = ↓ breast size; loss of feminine adipose tissue

Treatment Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis: Reversal of underlying cause. Induction with

fertility medications if trying to conceive. If not, use oral contraceptives.

Tumors: Excision; medical therapy for prolactinomas (eg, cabergoline, bromocriptine). Premature ovarian insufficiency (<40 years of age): If the uterus is present, treatment

with combined oral contraceptives or estrogen plus progestin replacement therapy.

PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA

Menstrual pain associated with ovulatory cycles in the absence of pathologic findings. Caused by uterine vasoconstriction, anoxia, and sustained contractions mediated by an excess of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α).

History/PE Presents with low, midline, spasmodic pelvic pain that often radiates to the back or inner

thighs

Cramps that occur in the first 1 to 3 days of menstruation possibly associated with nausea, diarrhea, headache, and flushing

No pathologic findings on pelvic examination

Diagnosis A diagnosis of exclusion. Rule out secondary dysmenorrhea (see next section).

Treatment Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical heat therapy, combined hormonal contraception, progestin intrauterine device (IUD).

SECONDARY DYSMENORRHEA

Menstrual pain for which an organic cause exists. Common causes include endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, adhesions, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

History/PE Patients may have a palpable uterine mass, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or vaginal or cervical discharge. However, normal abdominal and pelvic exams do not rule out pathology.

See Table 2.11-3 for distinguishing features of endometriosis vs adenomyosis.

Diagnosis Obtain a β-hCG test to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Perform a pelvic examination to assess uterine size, tenderness, and consistency and to

evaluate for ovarian masses.

The most likely diagnosis is pregnancy. It can be confirmed with a β-human chorionic gonadotropic (β-hCG) test.

Order the following:

Complete blood cell (CBC) count with differential to rule out infection Urinalysis (UA) to rule out urinary tract infection (UTI) Gonococcal/chlamydial swabs to rule out sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/PID Consider ultrasound to assess endometrium, uterus, and ovaries (look for pelvic pathology

Q

A 28-year-old woman presents for a wellness exam. She reports that approximately 2 weeks after her menses, she experiences intense, sharp lower quadrant abdominal pain that lasts a couple of hours. The pain varies from the right to the left side each cycle. What is the name of this phenomenon?

ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING

Normal menstrual bleeding ranges from 2 to 7 days. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) refers to alterations in quantity, duration, or frequency. Classified by the acronym PALM- COEIN.

PALM refers to structural causes—Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, and Malignancy/hyperplasia.

COEIN refers to nonstructural causes—Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, Iatrogenic, and Not yet classified.

KEY FACT

Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is cancer until proven otherwise.

History/PE Assess the extent of bleeding:

Oligomenorrhea: An ↑ length of time between menses (35–90 days between cycles) Polymenorrhea: Frequent menstruation (<21-day cycle) Heavy menstrual bleeding (previously termed menorrhagia): ↑ amount of flow

A

(>80 mL of blood loss per cycle) or prolonged bleeding (flow lasting >8 days). Heavy menstrual bleeding may lead to anemia.

Intermenstrual bleeding (previously termed metrorrhagia): Bleeding between periods.

Heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding (previously termed menometrorrhagia): Excessive and irregular bleeding.

On pelvic examination, the physician should evaluate the uterus and the cervix for a potential etiology of the bleeding. An enlarged uterus may be suggestive of pregnancy or uterine myomas. A cervical mass or other cervical abnormalities are concerning for cervical malignancy, infection, or an endocervical or prolapsed endometrial polyp.

Diagnosis β-hCG test to rule out pregnancy CBC to evaluate for anemia Pap smear to rule out cervical cancer Gonorrhea/chlamydia probe to rule out cervical bleeding from cervicitis Thyroid function tests and prolactin to rule out hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism and

This is called mittelschmerz, pain at ovulation caused by progesterone production. It can switch sides, depending on which ovary ovulates in a given cycle.

Treatment Acute heavy bleeding:

High-dose estrogen intravenously stabilizes the endometrial lining and typically stops bleeding within 1 hour. When bleeding stabilizes, the physician can transition patient to combined oral contraceptive or add progestin.

If estrogen is contraindicated, the physician can give high-dose progestin therapy alone. If bleeding is not controlled within 12 to 24 hours, dilation and curettage (D&C) may be

Contraception

Eighty-five percent of sexually active women with no contraception will become pregnant within 1 year. Table 2.11-4 describes the effectiveness of contraceptive methods along with their relative advantages and disadvantages. See Table 2.11-5 for contraindications to common methods of contraception.

Diagnosis Physical examination 21-Hydroxylase deficiency: ↑17-OH progesterone levels (a substrate for 21-hydroxylase). This is part of the newborn screen. Cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test—gold standard but not necessary if ↑↑ 17-OH.

11β-Hydroxylase deficiency: ↑ serum 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone. Both: Next, assessment of the following levels:

in 21-hydroxylase and adrenal/ovarian ([DHEA]) —.elevated in arrow] elevated. Also aldosterone, | sodium,

Cortisol → decreased. Androstenedione → elevated in 21-hydroxylase and 11β-hydroxylase deficiency [right

arrow] elevated. Also consider adrenal/ovarian neoplasm.

Dehydroepiandrosterone ([DHEA]) → elevated in 21-hydroxylase and 11β- hydroxylase deficiency [right arrow] elevated. Also consider adrenal neoplasm, Cushing syndrome.

If salt wasting: Will also have ↓ aldosterone, ↓ sodium, ↑ potassium, and ↑ renin associated with hypovolemia.
======================================
KEY FACT

21-Hydroxylase deficiency can present with hypotension, whereas 11β-hydroxylase and 17- hydroxylase deficiencies can present with hypertension caused by accumulation of deoxycorticosterone.

Treatment Glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone). Medical therapy for adrenal and ovarian disorders

prevents new terminal hair growth but does not resolve hirsutism.

Addition of mineralocorticoid therapy (eg, fludrocortisone) if salt wasting or hypotension is present.

Laser ablation, electrolysis, or conventional hair removal techniques for removal of unwanted hair.

POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME

A syndrome of excess testosterone and excess estrogen, PCOS has a prevalence of 6% to

10% among U.S. females of reproductive age and is the most common cause of infertility in females. Diagnosis requires fulfillment of two of the following three (Rotterdam criteria): Polycystic ovaries (via ultrasonography) Oligo-ovulation and/or anovulation Clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism

MNEMONIC

The most severe form of PCOS is HAIR-AN syndrome: HyperAndrogenism, Insulin Resistance, and Acanthosis Nigricans.

History/PE Common presentation: Obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30 kg/m2), menstrual cycle

disturbances, infertility, acne, androgenic alopecia, and hirsutism from hyperandrogenism

Females with PCOS also at ↑ risk for the following:

DM type 2: Acanthosis nigricans possibly seen on examination Metabolic syndrome: Insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension

Diagnosis Biochemical testing of hyperandrogenemia: ↑ testosterone

hyperandrogenemia: t testosterone than total testosterone globulin hyperandrogenism: DHEAS androgen=secreting rule out nonclassical clinical signs of Cushing

↑ free testosterone more sensitive than total testosterone (total can be normal) because of low sex hormone–binding globulin

Excluding other causes of hyperandrogenism: DHEAS to rule out adrenal tumor Pelvic ultrasound to rule out androgen-secreting ovarian tumor 17-Hydroxyprogesterone to rule out nonclassical CAH Screening in the setting of clinical signs of Cushing syndrome (eg, moon facies,

buffalo hump, abdominal striae) or acromegaly (eg, ↑ head size)

Evaluation for metabolic abnormalities: Two-hour oral glucose tolerance test Fasting lipid and lipoprotein levels (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides)

Optional tests: Not necessary if both oligomenorrhea and signs of hyperandrogenism are present

Transvaginal ultrasonography: Look for more than 11 small (2–9 mm), subcapsular follicles forming a “pearl necklace” sign (see Fig. 2.11-7). Seen in roughly two thirds of females with PCOS.

Gonadotropins: ↑ LH/FSH ratio (>2:1) 24-hour urine for free cortisol: Adult-onset CAH or Cushing syndrome

Treatment Females who are not attempting to conceive: The physician can treat these patients with combined hormonal contraception or progestin ± an antiandrogen like spironolactone if there are symptoms of hyperandrogenism. Patients with metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance may benefit from the addition of metformin.

Females who are attempting to conceive: Letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) ± metformin is first-line treatment for ovulatory stimulation. Clomiphene (selective estrogen receptor modulator) is second-line. Symptom-specific treatment:

Hirsutism: Combination OCPs first line; antiandrogens (spironolactone, finasteride) and metformin

Obesity, cardiovascular risk factors, lipid levels: Diet, weight loss (can also help regulate ovulation), and exercise plus potentially lipid-controlling medication (eg, statins)

or progestin | the risk with PCOS.
======================================
KEY FACT

Combined hormonal contraception or progestin ↓ the risk for endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma among women with PCOS.

Complications Infertility Miscarriage Type 2 DM Metabolic syndrome ↑ long-term risk for breast and endometrial cancers because of unopposed estrogen

secretion

KEY FACT

Female causes of infertility are more common than male causes. An investigation should begin with history (including menstrual) and physical examination of the female and then progress to semen analysis before further workup in the female, as semen analysis is simple and noninvasive.

INFERTILITY

Definition:

The inability to conceive after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse in women <35 years of age

The inability to conceive after 6 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse in women ≥35 years of age

Primary infertility characterized by no prior pregnancies; secondary infertility distinguished by at least one prior pregnancy. Etiologies are shown in Figure 2.11-8 and Table 2.11-8.

MENOPAUSE

Cessation of menses for a minimum of 12 months as a result of follicular depletion.

History/PE The average age of onset is 51 years. Symptoms include hot flashes, pruritus, vaginal dryness caused by vaginal atrophy,

insomnia, anxiety/irritability, poor concentration, mood changes, dyspareunia, and loss of libido.

“Premature menopause” (also known as premature ovarian insufficiency) is cessation of menses before 40 years of age.

Diagnosis A clinical diagnosis. The following studies are not routine but may be helpful: Labs: ↑ FSH Serum TSH should be measured because of overlap of symptoms and common age of

presentation of hypothyroidism and menopause

Treatment Best initial treatment: HRT (combination estrogen and progestin) in symptomatic

patients without contraindications <60:

Short-term use associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality. Risk:benefit ratio changes based on individual risk factors when considering continuing therapy long-

term

May ↑ the incidence of breast cancer with long-term use at high doses May ↑ cardiovascular mortality if initiated at age >60 and/or greater than 10 years from

the menopausal transition

Contraindications: Vaginal bleeding, breast cancer (known or suspected), untreated endometrial cancer, history of thromboembolism, chronic liver disease, hypertriglyceridemia, known coronary artery disease

Non-HRT (for those with contraindications to HRT listed earlier): Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), clonidine, and/or gabapentin to ↓ the frequency of hot flashes

Topical estrogen preparation: Useful for vaginal atrophy; topical estrogen preparation does NOT have the same contraindications as systemic HRT

Calcium supplements ± bisphosphonates: Useful for osteoporosis; dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is used to measure bone mineral density (BMD); supplemental treatment includes daily calcium/vitamin D and weight-bearing exercise

KEY FACT

Postmenopausal women should be routinely screened for osteoporosis, starting at 65 years of age or earlier if there are additional risk factors.

DISORDERS THE BARTHOLIN may lead to cyst formation,
======================================
GYNECOLOGIC DISORDERS

CYST AND ABSCESS OF THE BARTHOLIN DUCT

Obstruction of the Bartholin duct may lead to cyst formation, as mucus continues to accumulate behind the obstruction, causing cystic dilation. An obstructed Bartholin duct that becomes infected can develop a polymicrobial abscess.

History/PE Cysts: 1 to 3 cm in size, unilateral, and often asymptomatic. Larger cysts lead to periodic,

painful swelling and dyspareunia.

Clinical diagnosis: Mass at medial labia majora or lower vestibular area on physical examination.

Abscess: Extremely painful, warm, fluctuant mass at medial labia majora or lower vestibule with possible cellulitis and fever.

Treatment Asymptomatic cysts: No therapy ± warm soaks. The physician can consider drainage and

biopsy if patient >40 years of age to exclude carcinoma.

Abscess: Aspiration or incision and drainage to prevent reaccumulation. The physician should order tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia and other pathogens.

Antibiotics are unnecessary unless cellulitis or sexually transmitted infection (STI) is present.

VAGINITIS

A spectrum of conditions that cause vulvovaginal symptoms such as itching, burning, irritation, and abnormal discharge. The most common causes are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis (see Table 2.11-9).
======================================

A 56-year-old woman presents with presents with insomnia, vaginal dryness, and lack of menses for 13 months. What is the most likely diagnosis?

The most likely diagnosis is menopause. Menopause is a clinical diagnosis determined retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea without any other obvious physiologic or pathologic cause. However, a physician trying to rule out menopause as a cause of secondary amenorrhea may consider ordering an FSH level. Elevation is suggestive of menopause.

Diagnosis/Treatment Vaginal fluid for vaginal pH, amine ("whiff") test, wet mount (with saline), and 10%

potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy (Fig. 2.11-9).

If purulent discharge, numerous leukocytes on wet prep, cervical friability, and any symptoms of PID: Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) or cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or C trachomatis to rule out cervicitis. NAAT is the gold-standard test.
======================================
Treatment: Etiology specific (see Table 2.11-9).

KEY FACT

Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (three of four are required): Abnormal whitish-gray discharge Vaginal pH >4.5 ⊕ amine ("whiff") test Clue cells composing >20% of epithelial cells on wet mount

CERVICITIS

Inflammation of the uterine cervix. Etiologies are as follows:

A

Infectious (most common):

C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae are most common. C trachomatis is more common than N gonorrhoeae in mucopurulent cervicitis. Trichomonas and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are less common causes of cervicitis.

Noninfectious: Trauma, radiation exposure, malignancy All sexually active women <25 years of age should undergo yearly screening for C

trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae because of increased rates of asymptomatic infection and increased risk for infertility in untreated infections.

History/PE Mucopurulent discharge; ⊕ cervical motion tenderness; absence of other signs of PID

Diagnosis and Treatment Relevant discussion of STIs in the Renal/Genitourinary chapter. If mucopurulent discharge is present, empiric treatment for both C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae is warranted.

KEY FACT

Genital ulcers: Treponema pallidum causes single painless chancres. Haemophilus ducreyi (doo·kray·ee) causes deep painful ulcers with irregular borders

causes deep painful painful ulcers. DISEASE the upper genital tract

(you “do cry”).

HSV causes multiple shallow painful ulcers.

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

PID is a polymicrobial infection of the upper genital tract associated with N gonorrhoeae (one third of cases), C trachomatis (one third of cases), and endogenous aerobes/anaerobes. Risk factors include uterine instrumentation or procedure, douching, smoking, multiple sex partners, and prior STDs and/or PID. Most cases are not secondary to STDs.

Q 1

A 20-year-old woman is diagnosed with trichomoniasis and prescribed an antibiotic. She calls her physician, reporting of flushing, nausea, and emesis. What antibiotic was the patient prescribed, and what should she have been warned of?
======================================
Q 2

A 23-year-old woman presents with fever and abdominal pain of 2 days’ duration. She has a ⊕ cervical motion tenderness. Antibiotics are started. What is the next step in management?

History/PE Presents with lower abdominal pain, fever, chills, menstrual disturbances, and purulent

cervical discharge

Cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness Orogenital contact that can cause gonococcal pharyngitis along with PID

Diagnosis Diagnosed by the presence of acute lower abdominal or pelvic pain plus one of the

following:

Uterine tenderness Adnexal tenderness Cervical motion tenderness

First, a β-hCG test to rule out pregnancy Best test: NAAT for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis A WBC count >10,000 cells/μL: Poor positive and negative predictive values for PID Ultrasonography (not sensitive or specific): Possibly showing thickening or dilation of the

fallopian tubes, fluid in the cul-de-sac, a multicystic ovary, or tubo-ovarian abscess

MNEMONIC

Acute causes of pelvic pain— A ROPE Appendicitis—Periumbilical → right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, fever, nausea, vomiting Ruptured ovarian cyst—Recent strenuous physical activity Ovarian torsion or abscess—Torsion: severe unilateral pain (may be colicky), nausea,

lower quadrant (RLQ) strenuous physical activity severe unilateral pain of fever, vaginal discharge out with B-hCG test

vomiting; abscess: gradual onset of fever, vaginal discharge, respectively

PID—Gradual onset of fever, vaginal discharge Ectopic pregnancy—To be ruled out with β-hCG test

Treatment Antibiotic treatment should not be delayed while awaiting culture results. All sexual

partners should be examined and treated appropriately.

Outpatient regimens:

Regimen A: Ceftriaxone IM for one dose + doxycycline PO for 14 days ± metronidazole PO for 14 days (metronidazole covers anaerobic infections).

Regimen B: Ofloxacin or levofloxacin for 14 days ± metronidazole for 14 days. This is only in special cases because there is an increase in quinolone-resistant N gonorrhoeae.

Treatment should not be delayed for NAAT.
======================================
Inpatient antibiotic regimens:

Cefoxitin or cefotetan plus doxycycline for 14 days Clindamycin plus gentamicin for 14 days

Additional intervention:

Drainage of a tubo-ovarian/pelvic abscess is appropriate if mass persists after antibiotic treatment, abscess is >4 to 6 cm, or mass is in the cul-de-sac in the midline and drainable through the vagina.

If the patient’s condition deteriorates, the case calls for exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy.

Surgery may range from total hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy with lysis of

adhesions in severe cases to conservative surgery for females who desire to maintain fertility.

KEY FACT

Mild and subclinical PID are major causes of tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain caused by pelvic scarring.

Complications Repeated episodes of infection, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and ectopic pregnancy Infertility (10% after the first episode, 25% after the second episode, and 50% after a third

episode)

2 A

The next step in management is pelvic ultrasonography to rule out tubo-ovarian abscess.

OVARIAN TORSION

Twisting of the ovarian vascular pedicle that occludes venous and/or arterial flow to the ovary, leading to ischemia.

History/PE Colicky, lower quadrant abdominal pain of acute onset with peritoneal signs, nausea, and

vomiting.

Risk factors, including PCOS and ovarian tumors and cysts. Most common times for torsion in pregnancy: 18 weeks’ gestation, when the uterus is rising over the pelvic brim or immediately postpartum with uterine involution. The increased motion of the uterus at these times increases the risk for torsion.

Diagnosis Best initial test:

Ultrasound with Doppler may show ovarian abnormal venous or arterial flow. CT can help with visualization of an ovarian mass or cyst but will not provide information

on blood flow to the ovary.

False negatives are possible due to intermittent torsion. If suspicion persists following a negative ultrasound, surgical evaluation is indicated.

Treatment Laparoscopy or laparotomy with detorsion if the ovary is still viable or oophorectomy if not viable
======================================
PEDIATRIC VAGINAL DISCHARGE

Etiologies of vaginal discharge in pediatric patients include the following:

Foreign objects: Most common cause of vaginal discharge in pediatric patients Infectious vulvovaginitis: May present with a malodorous, yellow-green, purulent

discharge. Causes include the following:

Group A Streptococcus: The most common infectious cause Candida: Recent antibiotic therapy, immunosuppression (eg, diabetes); rare in children STIs: Typically from sexual abuse

Noninfectious vulvovaginitis: Potential causes include poor hygiene, contact dermatitis, and eczema

Sarcoma botryoides (rhabdomyosarcoma): A malignancy with lesions that have the appearance of “bunches of grapes” within the vagina

KEY FACT

normal, but STDsresulting Child Protective Services. syndrome toxin 1

Pediatric vaginal discharge may be normal, but STDs resulting from sexual abuse must be ruled out and, if found, reported to Child Protective Services.

TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME

Caused by a reaction to toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), a preformed Staphylococcus aureus toxin. Menstrual cases occur due to retained tampons (used for longer than recommended). Nonmenstrual cases are nearly as common as menstrual cases and occur in the setting of surgical wounds and burns.

History/PE Presents with abrupt onset of fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea A diffuse macular erythematous rash involving the palms and soles Nonpurulent conjunctivitis common Desquamation, especially of the palms and soles, generally occurring during recovery

within 1 to 2 weeks of illness

KEY FACT

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but potentially fatal reaction to S aureus toxin, not to the bacterium itself.

Diagnosis Based on clinical presentation: Fever >102°F (38.9°C), hypotension, skin findings,

involvement of three or more organ systems

⊖ blood cultures, given that TSS is caused by a preformed toxin and not invasive properties of the organism

Treatment Rapid rehydration, examination for foreign objects in vaginal canal, drainage if localized

infection found

Empiric antibiotics: Clindamycin + vancomycin; clindamycin is used for its antitoxin properties

If methicillin-sensitive S aureus isolated in wound, clindamycin + oxacillin OR nafcillin If methicillin-resistant S aureus isolated, clindamycin + vancomycin OR linezolid

Complications Mortality rate associated with TSS is 3% to 6%. Causes of death include cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure caused

by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulopathy caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

BENIGN BREAST DISORDERS

NONPROLIFERATIVE BREAST LESIONS

LESIONS cancer. Simple breast from an exaggerated radiographically like

Generally, no increased risk for breast cancer. Simple breast cysts are the most common; they are fluid-filled masses stemming from an exaggerated stromal tissue response to hormones and growth factors.

Fat necrosis of the breast:

Benign condition that presents radiographically like breast cancer, but the breast biopsy

reveals fat globules. No further workup indicated. Secondary to trauma to the breast or caffeine use. Typically, females 30 to 50 years of age develop nonproliferative breast lesions

(postmenopausal females rarely develop them).

Provide reassurance and pain control.

Fibrocystic changes of the breast:

Benign condition that presents as bilateral breast tenderness with diffuse, cordlike thickening of the breasts with no discharge

Tenderness worsens during menstruation

Fibroadenoma:

Benign condition that presents as solitary, mobile, well-circumscribed nodule Tenderness and size increase during menstruation Classically seen in women <30 years of age Provide reassurance and pain control Discussed more later

KEY FACT

The differential diagnosis of a breast mass includes fibrocystic disease, breast cyst

fibroadenoma, mastitis/abscess, fat necrosis, and breast cancer.

History/PE Cyclic bilateral mastalgia and swelling, most prominent just before menstruation Rapid fluctuation in size of masses—a common finding

First, have patient return after menstruation, because symptoms fluctuate with hormones. Best initial test: If unchanged on follow-up, perform ultrasonography to differentiate a

mass from a fluid-filled one vs a solid one.

Subsequent test: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a discrete mass that is suggestive of a cyst is indicated to alleviate pain and to confirm the cystic nature of the mass.

Most accurate test: Excisional biopsy is indicated if no fluid is obtained or if the fluid is bloody on aspiration.

Mammography is of limited use (especially if <35 years of age because of density of breast tissue).

There is no ↑ risk for breast cancer if patient has a simple cyst, but there is ↑ risk if patient has a complex cyst (ductal epithelial hyperplasia or cellular atypia), which is rare.
======================================
KEY FACT

Intraductal papilloma and mammary duct ectasia are common causes of bloody nipple discharge.

PROLIFERATIVE BREAST LESIONS WITHOUT ATYPIA

Include intraductal papillomas, sclerosing adenosis, and usual ductal hyperplasia. Associated with a small increased risk for breast cancer. An intraductal papilloma is composed of papillary cells growing from the wall of a cyst into the lumen. Dx: These lesions are diagnosed with core needle biopsy. Surgical excision is required to

exclude atypia or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Tx: Sclerosing adenosis and usual ductal hyperplasia require no treatment.

a needle biopsy or FNA. Tx: Excision is curative.

PHYLLODES TUMOR

Can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from a fibroadenoma. It is generally larger with greater metastatic ability, and the differentiating features are the papillary projections of the stroma, lined with epithelium and associated with hyperplasia and atypia. Phyllodes tumors should be completely excised; axillary lymph node dissection is not necessary (see Fig. 2.11- 11).

BREAST CANCER

The most common cancer (affects one in eight women) and the second most common cause of cancer death in females (after lung cancer) in the United States. Sixty percent occur in the upper outer quadrant. One half of newly diagnosed patients have risk factors. Risk factors include the following:

Female sex; older age (above 40 years of age) A personal history of breast cancer; family history in a first-degree relative; genetic factors

(BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations: associated with early onset)

Alcohol; cigarettes (controversial) Exposure to radiation A history of fibrocystic change with cellular atypia ↑ exposure to estrogen (nulliparity, early menarche, late menopause, first full-term

pregnancy after 35 years of age, PCOS, HRT)

History/PE Clinical manifestations include the following:

Early findings: Single, nontender, immovable, firm-to-hard mass with ill-defined margins or mammographic abnormalities on routine screening

Later findings/locally advanced:

Axillary lymphadenopathy, breast enlargement, pain, peau d’orange skin findings suggesting inflammation (redness, thickening, dimpling), fixation of the mass to the

skin or chest wall

Prolonged unilateral scaling erosion (with eczematous rash) of the nipple that spreads to the areola with or without discharge (Paget disease of the nipple, specific for DCIS)

Late findings: Ulceration, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, edema of the arm Metastatic disease:

Metastases to the bone (pain), lung (dyspnea, cough), and liver (abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice)

A firm or hard axillary node >1 cm Axillary nodes that are matted or fixed to the skin (stage III); ipsilateral supraclavicular

Ultrasonography. The patient is <30 years of age, so ultrasonography is the preferred means of distinguishing a solid mass from a cyst.

Diagnosis Majority of breast cancers diagnosed from mammography.

Screening:

Postmenopausal women: Mammography. The physician should look for ↑ density with microcalcifications, irregular borders, and spiculated mass. Mammography can

detect lesions roughly 2 years before they become clinically palpable (see Fig. 2.11- 14A).

FIGURE 2.11-12. Breast cancer. Mediolateral oblique (A) and craniocaudal (B) views from a mammogram demonstrate a spiculated mass with a satellite mass (circles in A and B) in the central and outer upper right breast. A targeted breast ultrasonogram (C) in a different patient demonstrates a hypoechoic mass (arrow) that is taller than it is wide and exhibits dense posterior acoustic shadowing.

Ultrasonography for females distinguish a solid mass factors are recommended

Premenopausal women: Ultrasonography for females <30 years of age because of density of breast tissue; can distinguish a solid mass from a benign cyst (see Fig. 2.11- 14C).

Women with the following risk factors are recommended by the American Cancer Society to undergo annual MRI screening:

Known BRCA mutation First-degree relative who is a BRCA carrier Lifetime risk for breast cancer that is 20% to 25% or greater

Biopsy of suspicious lesions on mammography:

A mammography-guided FNA or core needle biopsy. A full-thickness skin biopsy should be done if signs of inflammation are present.

FNA: A good initial biopsy, especially for lesions close to the skin; however, it is a small sample with a high false-⊖ rate. FNA may also be used to follow response to treatment.

Core needle biopsy: A larger sample that allows testing for receptor status. Open biopsy: Less commonly used. It provides tissue for a more accurate diagnosis

and allows immediate resection of tumor; however, an open biopsy requires taking the patient to the operating room.
======================================
KEY FACT

The first step in the workup of a suspicious mass in postmenopausal females and in those >30 years of age is a mammogram. For premenopausal females <30 years of age, the first step should be an ultrasound.

Receptor status of tumor: Determination of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone

receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status

Tumor markers for recurrent breast cancer: Typically used for metastatic disease as a proxy to monitor treatment response. Include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 or CA 27-29.

Metastatic disease:

Imaging: X-ray of the chest (CXR); CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; brain MRI. Positron emission tomography (PET) and bone scans can also be useful.

Treatment Early stage:

Breast-conserving surgery + radiation or mastectomy ± radiation (if cancer in deep margins or axillary lymph nodes). In both cases, the situation also calls for sentinel node biopsy for evaluation of axillary lymph nodes.

Adjuvant therapy as indicated.

Locally advanced:

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + HER2-directed therapy to reduce size of tumor to allow for breast-conserving therapy as opposed to mastectomy

Breast conservation surgery or mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy Adjuvant therapy as indicated

Adjuvant therapy:

All ER/PR ⊕ patients should receive tamoxifen (a selective estrogen receptor modulator [SERM] that competitively antagonizes the ER, inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells) or an aromatase inhibitor if postmenopausal (inactivates aromatase that converts peripheral androgens to estrogens).

receive tamoxifen (a antagonizes the ER, if postmenopausal estrogens).

KEY FACT

Owrr

In a postmenopausal woman with a new breast lesion, the physician should maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for breast cancer.

All HER2⊕ patients should receive HER2-directed therapies such as trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to HER2 receptors on the cancer cell (watch for cardiotoxicity).

ER, PR, and HER2⊖ patients should receive chemotherapy if tumor >0.5 cm. Contraindications to breast-conserving therapy (lumpectomy): Large tumor size, subareolar location, multifocal tumors, fixation to the chest wall, prior radiation to the chest wall, or involvement of the nipple or overlying skin.

Stage IV disease: Treated with radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, and biologic therapy

(depending on the receptor status of the tumor). Table 2.11-10 describes the breast cancer stages.
======================================
TABLE 2.11-10. Breast Cancer Stages

Tamoxifen use is associated with hot flashes, endometrial cancer, and venous thromboembolism because it has mixed antagonist (breast) and agonist (endometrium) activity on estrogen receptors.

KEY FACT

Stage II of breast cancer is associated with tumor size >2 cm, stage III is associated with nodal involvement, and stage IV is associated with metastases.

Prognosis TNM staging (I–IV) is the most reliable indicator of prognosis. ⊕ ER status and PR status are associated with a favorable prognosis. Cancer localized to the breast has a 75% to 90% cure rate. With spread to the axilla, the 5-

year survival rate is 40% to 50%.

Complications Pleural effusion is common in patients with metastatic breast cancer; edema of the arm is common secondary to nodal involvement.

KEY FACT

Inflammatory breast carcinoma is rare, but it is an aggressive cancer that presents with peau d’orange skin (edematous cutaneous thickening) along with a red and painful breast mass. Axillary lymphadenopathy is typically present.

BENIGN GYNECOLOGIC DISORDERS

UTERINE LEIOMYOMAS (FIBROIDS)

Fibroids are the most common benign neoplams of the female genital tract. They present as singular or multiple discrete, round, and firm tumors. Composed of smooth muscle and

connective tissue, fibroids may cause infertility or menorrhagia.

Fibroids are hormone sensitive; size will ↑ in pregnancy and ↓ after menopause. Malignant transformation to leiomyosarcoma is rare (0.1%–0.5%). Prevalence: More common in Black females (50%) than in White females (25%)
======================================
KEY FACT

An irregular and mobile uterus is the key physical examination finding for fibroids.

History/PE Majority of cases are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may present with the following:

Bleeding: Longer, heavier periods; anemia Mass effect: Pelvic/rectal pressure, constipation, and urinary frequency or retention Pain: Secondary dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia Pelvic symptoms: A firm, nontender, irregular, enlarged (“lumpy-bumpy”), or

cobblestone uterus may be felt on physical examination.

KEY FACT

after menopause; suspect To look for uterine

If a uterine mass continues to grow after menopause, suspect malignancy.

Diagnosis Physical examination Ultrasonography (transvaginal): To look for uterine myomas; can also exclude ovarian

masses. Calcification indicates necrosis.

MRI: Can delineate intramural, subserosal, and submucous myomas. The best modality for visualization, MRI is usually reserved in preparation for surgery or if there is concern for leiomyosarcoma (a new or growing mass in a postmenopausal female).

CBC: To assess for anemia.

Treatment If asymptomatic, expectant management with annual pelvic exams and CBCs as needed Pharmacologic:

Combined hormonal contraception Medroxyprogesterone acetate or danazol to slow or stop bleeding GnRH analogues (leuprolide or nafarelin) to ↓ the size of myomas, suppress further growth, and ↓ surrounding vascularity. These also may be used before surgery to decrease uterine size, help with anemia, and allow a minimally invasive approach to hysterectomy. NSAIDs for pain.

Surgery:

Females of childbearing years: Abdominal or hysteroscopic myomectomy Females who have completed childbearing: Hysterectomy. Uterine artery embolization (∼25% will need further invasive treatment)

Emergent surgery may be required if torsion of a pedunculated myoma occurs

Complications Infertility may be caused by a myoma that distorts the uterine cavity and plays a role similar to that of an IUD.

NONNEOPLASTIC OVARIAN CYSTS

Nonneoplastic cysts are the most common cause of ovarian enlargement (see Table 2.11-11). Ovarian lesions are more likely to be benign if unilateral, simple, smaller than 8 cm, and in women <45 years of age. Malignant ovarian lesions are discussed in detail later in this chapter.
======================================
TABLE 2.11-11. Common Benign Ovarian Cysts (Nonneoplastic)

TYPE INFORMATION Follicular ovarian cysts Occurs when follicle develops into maturity and does not (physiologic cysts) rupture to release ovum Corpus luteal cyst Corpus luteum fails to involute and continues enlarging postovulation Theca lutein cyst Occurs from overstimulation from hormones (hCG) Luteoma Nonneoplastic ovarian mass Associated with pregnancy, maternal hirsutism/virilization

postovulation Occurs from overstimulation Nonneoplastic ovarian Associated with pregnancy,

GYNECOLOGIC NEOPLASMS

Gynecologic cancers include uterine, endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar neoplasms. Ovarian cancer carries the highest mortality.

ENDOMETRIAL CANCER

Type I endometrioid adenocarcinomas derive from atypical endometrial hyperplasia and are the most common female reproductive cancer in the United States. Type II cancers derive from serous or clear cell histology (see Table 2.11-12). Although type II cancers tend to be more aggressive, diagnosis and management are similar for both types. Type 1 is the most curable gynecologic cancer.

TABLE 2.11-12. Types of Endometrial Cancer

VARIABLE TYPE |: ENDOMETRIOID TYPE II: SEROUS Epidemiology 75% of endometrial cancers 25% of endometrial cancers Etiology Unopposed estrogen stimulation Unrelated to estrogen; p53 (eg, obesity, tamoxifen use, exog- mutation present in 90% enous estrogen-only therapy) of cases Precursor lesion Hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia Mean age at diagnosis 55 years 67 years Prognosis Favorable Poor

KEY FACT

Vaginal bleeding is present in 80% of women with endometrial carcinoma, but only 5% to 10% of women with abnormal vaginal bleeding have endometrial cancer.

Finally, endometrial biopsy. If patient is postmenopausal with recurrent or persistent bleeding, a biopsy is necessary, regardless of ultrasonography results.
======================================
KEY FACT

Hormonal contraceptives reduce the risk for endometrial cancer.

KEY FACT

When to perform a biopsy for endometrial cancer: Postmenopausal: Endometrial stripe >4 mm or any recurrent or persistent bleeding,

spotting regardless of ultrasound results

Premenopausal: Sustained intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, or amenorrhea after initial workup and in the setting of unopposed estrogen (obesity, DM)

Treatment High-dose progestins for women who desire future fertility Hysterectomy and BSO ± radiation for postmenopausal women Hysterectomy and BSO with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation for advanced-stage

cancer

CERVICAL CANCER

The endocervix lies proximal to the external os, is nonvisible, and is composed of columnar cells (similar to the lower uterine segment). The ectocervix is visible and composed of squamous cells (similar to the vagina). The exposure of columnar cells to an acidic vaginal pH results in metaplasia to squamous cells. The normal squamocolumnar junction (transformation zone) is in the ectocervix and can be exposed to carcinogens, resulting in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), an abnormal proliferation or overgrowth of the basal cell layer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA is found in 99.7% of all cervical carcinomas. HPV 16

is the most prevalent type in squamous cell carcinoma; HPV 18 is most prevalent in adenocarcinoma.

Additional risk factors include immunosuppression; infection with HIV; or a history of STIs, tobacco use, or high parity.

HPV vaccine protects against nine different pathogenic strains, including HPV types 6 and 11 (cause 90% of genital warts) and 16 and 18 (causes 70% of cervical cancer). The vaccine is recommended for males and females 11 to 26 years of age and may be considered in certain high-risk patients up to age 45.

History/PE Intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital spotting, and cervical ulceration are the most common

signs.

Bloody or purulent, malodorous, nonpruritic discharge may appear after invasion.

Obstetricians and Gynecologists begin at 21, years of females with previously smear (cytology) every 3

Screening The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) currently recommends that screening for cervical cancer begin at 21 years of age regardless of onset of sexual activity.

Screening recommendations for females with previously normal examinations:

21 to 29 years of age: Pap smear (cytology) every 3 years 30 to 65 years of age: Pap smear every 3 years or cotesting (Pap smear + HPV test)

every 5 years

65 years of age: Stoppage of screening if prior tests were negative See Table 2.11-13 for classification systems of Pap smears
======================================
TABLE 2.11-13. Classification of Pap Smears

CIN BETHESDA SYSTEM Benign Negative Benign with inflammation ASC-US ASC-H CINI LSIL ; CIN II HSIL CIN III HSIL . Invasive cancer Invasive cancer Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the histologic classification. The Bethesda system is used for reporting cytologic diagnoses.

Females with diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure (risk for clear cell cancer) and/or immunocompromised status (including HIV positivity) should continue to be screened as long as they do not have a life-limiting condition.

Females with HIV should be screened with cytology twice in their first year after diagnosis and then annually.

Diagnosis See algorithm in Figure 2.11-14. Applications of the information determine management. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): Repeat Pap smear at 12 months. If ⊖

×2, then routine screening.

Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US): Depends on cotesting; colposcopy if positive high-risk HPV.

High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): Colposcopy.

Treatment For noninvasive disease, treatment is based on likelihood of progression to cervical cancer and patient’s age/desire for future childbearing is as follows:

CIN I: Observation with yearly Pap smears vs ablative therapy when done with childbearing

CIN II: Observation or ablative/excisional therapy depending on childbearing status CIN III: Excisional therapy Postablative or excisional therapy follow-up:

CIN I, or CIN II or III with negative margins:: Pap smear at 12 months and/or HPV testing

CIN II or III with ⊕ margins: Pap smear at 6 months; consider a repeat endocervical curettage

Treatment based on biopsy results for invasive disease is as follows (for staging, see Fig. 2.11-15):

STAGE 0 Extent of Carcinoma tumor in-situ 5-year 93% survival Stage at presentation STAGE 1 Confined to cervix and/or uterus IA93% IB 80% 47% Fundus: Uterine eavity ute EY wall \ Internal os-f Fallopian STAGE 2 Spreads beyond uterus but not to pelvic wall or lower 1/3 of vagina 1A 63% 1B 58% 28% Spreads to pelvic sidewall STAGE 4 Invades bladder, rectum, or distant metastasis beyond true pelvis 16% IVA 15% VB 4%

FIGURE 2.11-15. Staging of cervical cancer. Anatomic display of the stages of cervical cancer, defined by location, extent of tumor, frequency of presentation, and 5-year survival. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Microinvasive carcinoma (stage IA1): Treat with cone biopsy and close follow-up or simple hysterectomy.

Stages IA2, IB1, IB2, IIA: May be treated either with radical hysterectomy or with radiation therapy plus chemotherapy.

Stages IIB, III, IV: Treat with radiation therapy plus concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Prognosis Five-year survival rates are inversely proportionate to the stage of cancer, with state 1A having more than 95% survival and state IV having <20% survival.
======================================
VULVAR CANCER

Risk factors include HPV (types 16, 18, and 31), lichen sclerosus, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking, high-risk sexual behavior, and immunosuppression. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is precancerous and is more

commonly found in premenopausal women.

History/PE Presents with pruritus, pain, or ulceration of the mass Additional symptoms that include the following:

Early: Lesions that appear white, pigmented, raised, thickened, nodular, or ulcerative Late: Presents with a large and cauliflowerlike or hard and ulcerated area in the vulva

Diagnosis Vulvar punch biopsy for any suspicious lesions or persistent vulvar pruritus, especially in postmenopausal patients

Treatment High-grade VIN: Topical chemotherapy, laser ablation, wide local excision, skinning

vulvectomy, and simple vulvectomy

Invasive:

Radical vulvectomy and regional lymphadenectomy Wide local excision of the primary tumor with inguinal lymph node dissection ±

preoperative radiation, chemotherapy, or both

VAGINAL CANCER

gynecologic malignancies. (eg, long-term pessary radiation for cervical exposure. Etiologies are squamous cell

Accounts for 1% to 2% of all gynecologic malignancies. Risk factors include immunosuppression, chronic irritation (eg, long-term pessary use or prolapse of female organs), low socioeconomic status, radiation for cervical cancer, hysterectomy for dysplasia, multiple sexual partners, and DES exposure. Etiologies are as follows:

Postmenopausal females: Usually squamous cell carcinoma Younger females: Usually other histologic types (eg, adenocarcinoma, clear cell

adenocarcinoma from DES)

History/PE Presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding, abnormal discharge, or postcoital bleeding Found in the upper third of the vagina in 75% of patients

Diagnosis Definitive diagnosis is with biopsy and staging.

Treatment Local excision of involved areas when they are few and small Partial or complete vaginectomy—if extensive involvement of the vaginal mucosa Radiation therapy or radical surgery—if invasive disease
======================================
OVARIAN CANCER

Most ovarian tumors are benign, but malignant tumors are the leading cause of death from reproductive tract cancer. There is no screening test for ovarian cancer. Risk factors include

the following:

Age, low parity, ↓ fertility, or delayed childbearing. ⊕ family history: Patients with one affected first-degree relative have a 5% lifetime risk.

With two or more affected first-degree relatives, the risk is 7%.

Genetics: The BRCA1 mutation carries a 45% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer. The BRCA2 mutation is associated with a 25% lifetime risk.

Lynch II syndrome: Also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), it is associated with an ↑ risk for colon, ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancers. OCPs taken for 5 years or more ↓ risk by 29%.

KEY FACT

Frequency of female genital tract cancers: Endometrial > ovarian > cervical Number of deaths: Ovarian > endometrial > cervical

History/PE Both benign and malignant ovarian neoplasms are generally asymptomatic. Mild, nonspecific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms or pelvic pressure/pain may be seen. Early disease is typically not detected on routine pelvic exam. Some 75% of women present with advanced malignant disease, as evidenced by

advanced malignant palpable abdominal mass, benign and malignant Pelvic Masses MALIGNANT

abdominal pain and bloating, a palpable abdominal mass, and ascites.

Table 2.11-14 differentiates the benign and malignant characteristics of pelvic masses.

Diagnosis

Tumor markers (see Table 2.11-15): ↑ CA-125 is associated with epithelial cell cancer (90% of ovarian cancers), but is used only as a marker for progression and recurrence.
======================================
TABLE 2.11-15. Ovarian Tumor Characteristics

TUMOR Epithelial MARKER CA-125 CHARACTERISTICS Serous adenocarcinoma—the most common. A tumor may present with abdominal distention, bowel obstruction, and adnexal mass. Endodermal sinus (yolk sac) «-Fetoprotein (AFP) Very aggressive. An endodermal sinus may be seen in ovaries and/or sacrococcygeal area in young children; gross examination shows a yellow, friable, solid mass. Embryonal carcinoma Choriocarcinoma AFP, B-hCG B-hCG Very rare. Embryonal carcinoma may be seen in ado- lescents; it may present with precocious puberty and abnormal uterine bleeding. Can develop during or after pregnancy and after molar pregnancies. This is a malignancy of tropho- blastic tissue. Choriocarcinoma may be associated with bilateral theca-lutein cysts. It spreads hematogenously. Dysgerminoma Lactate dehydro- genase (LDH) Most commonly seen in adolescents with sheets of uniform “fried egg” cells. Granulosa cell Inhibin Most common malignant stromal tumor. Granulosa cells are often seen in females in their 50s; produc- tion of estrogen and/or progesterone may lead to postmenopausal bleeding, Call-Exner bodies on histology.

molar pregnancies. blastic tissue. with bilateral hematogenously. Most commonly

Premenopausal women: ↑ CA-125 may point to benign disease such as endometriosis

or a tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA).

Postmenopausal women: ↑ CA-125 (>35 units) indicates an ↑ likelihood that the ovarian tumor is malignant.

Transvaginal ultrasonography: Used to screen high-risk patients and as the first step in the workup of symptomatic females (eg, pelvic fullness, pelvic pain). A solid mass with thick septations ± ascites on ultrasound is highly suggestive of neoplasm.

KEY FACT

Granulosa cell tumors predispose to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma because of

unopposed estrogen secretion.

KEY FACT

Any ovarian or adnexal mass in a premenarchal or postmenopausal patient is suggestive of an ovarian neoplasm.

Treatment Ovarian masses in premenarchal females: Masses >2 cm in diameter require close clinical follow-up and often surgical removal.
======================================
Ovarian masses in premenopausal females:

Observation is appropriate for asymptomatic, mobile, unilateral, simple cystic masses <8 to 10 cm in diameter. Most resolve spontaneously.

Surgical evaluation of masses >8 to 10 cm in diameter and those that are complex and/or

unchanged on repeat pelvic examinations and ultrasonography. Ovarian masses in postmenopausal females:

Closely follow with ultrasonography asymptomatic, unilateral simple cysts <5 cm in

diameter with a normal CA-125. Surgically evaluate palpable masses.

masses. with omentectomy removal or

Ovarian cancer treatment:

Surgery:

Surgical staging: Hysterectomy/BSO with omentectomy and pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy

Benign neoplasms warrant tumor removal or unilateral oophorectomy

Perioperative chemotherapy: Routine except for females with early-stage or low-grade ovarian cancer

Radiation therapy: Reserved for advanced germ cell tumors, in particular dysgerminomas (not effective in epithelial ovarian cancer)

Prevention Females with the BRCA1 gene mutation should be screened every 6 months with

ultrasonography and CA-125 testing. Prophylactic oophorectomy is recommended by 40 years of age or whenever childbearing is completed.

OCP use ↓ the risk for ovarian cancer. There is no routine screening for ovarian cancer.

UROLOGIC GYNECOLOGY

PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE

Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include multiple vaginal deliveries, genetic predisposition, advancing age, prior pelvic surgery (hysterectomy), connective tissue disorders, and ↑ intra-abdominal pressure associated with obesity or straining with chronic

constipation.

History/PE Presents with the sensation of a bulge or protrusion in the vagina (see Fig. 2.11-16).

sense of incomplete by having the position.

Urinary or fecal incontinence, a sense of incomplete bladder emptying, and/or dyspareunia are also seen.

Diagnosis The degree of prolapse can be evaluated by having the patient perform the Valsalva maneuver while in the lithotomy position.

Treatment Supportive measures include a high-fiber diet, weight reduction in obese patients, and

limitations on straining and lifting.

Pessaries may reduce prolapse and are helpful in patients who do not wish to undergo surgery or in those for whom surgery is contraindicated.

Surgical procedure depends on where the prolapse is located:

Uterine prolapse is treated by a hysterectomy with vaginal vault suspension. Anterior/posterior vaginal wall: A prolapse here calls for repair of the anterior or

posterior wall (colporrhaphy).
======================================
SEXUAL DISORDERS

GENITOPELVIC PAIN DISORDER (VAGINISMUS)

Involuntary spasm of outer one third of the vagina

History/PE Some caused by situational/psychosocial causes

Can be associated with gynecologic disorders, chronic medical conditions, or certain medications

Treatment Most effective—cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy with systematic desensitization Deep muscle relaxation techniques and dilators

VULVODYNIA

Localized pain of the vulva, usually pain with insertion/at introitus.

History/PE Typically chronic and idiopathic

Treatment At start of treatment: Detailed history and physical examination Multidisciplinary treatment with pelvic floor physical therapy and counseling

are very important factors each child may develop most children.

Pediatric development and growth are very important factors that strongly influence the well- being of the future adult. Although each child may develop differently, certain milestones and growth standards are applicable to most children.

KEY FACT

Some signs that may be concerning for autism spectrum disorder include failure to achieve certain language milestones (eg, babbling/gesturing by 12 months of age, use of two-word phases by 24 months of age), impaired social interaction, restricted interest in objects/activities, and insistence on routine.
======================================
DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES

Assessed at routine well-child visits through age 6 years. Within each type of milestone (Table 2.12-1), two or more delays indicate a developmental delay of that type (eg, language delay). Delays in two or more types of development indicate a “global developmental delay.” Table 2.12-1 highlights major developmental milestones. If isolated language delay is present, audiology should be considered.

Language disorder:

Developmental disorder characterized by difficulty comprehending or producing language. Patients have a limited vocabulary for their age, use incorrect tenses, lack the ability to synthesize simple sentences, and may have word-finding difficulties.

Inability to communicate their needs verbally may lead to temper tantrums or physical aggression. An undetected language disorder increases the risk of developing specific learning disorders in a school-age child. Early recognition and intervention improve outcomes. Table 2.12-2 lists similar conditions that must be differentiated.

Toilet training:

Most children start toilet training at 2 years of age. Bedwetting (primary nocturnal enuresis) is normal until 5 years of age. If it persists at age

6 years or older, positive reinforcement (eg, bedwetting alarms) may be considered. Desmopressin (ADH analog) and anticholinergic medications (imipramine) may be provided for refractory cases. Be sure to rule out medical conditions such as bladder dysfunction, urinary tract infection, and diabetes insipidus.

PRIMITIVE REFLEXES

Reflexes that are present during infancy and disappear with frontal lobe development. Persistence of these reflexes indicates impairment of brain development. Return of these reflexes in an adult indicates frontal lobe lesions. Table 2.12-3 outlines commonly tested reflexes.

TABLE 2.12-3. Primitive Reflexes

REFLEX DESCRIPTION Moro reflex Startling causes extension and abduction of arms followed by flexion Rooting reflex Stroking the cheek causes head to turn toward ipsilateral side (nipple seeking) Sucking reflex Touching the roof of the mouth causes a sucking response Galant reflex Stroking infant along one side of spine in prone position causes flexion of lower body toward ipsilateral side Palmar grasp Stroking palm causes fingers to curl Plantar reflex Stroking the sole causes dorsiflexion of big toe and fanning out of the other toes; it is normal through age 12 months Babinski sign: Persistence after age 12 months or reappearance indicates an upper motor neuron (UMN) issue

GROWTH

and weight + routinely in the first 2 is macrocephaly and imaging); | head circumference infections, fetal alcohol

At each well-child checkup, height and weight ± head circumference are plotted on growth charts specific for sex and age:

Head circumference: Measured routinely in the first 2 years. ↑ head circumference greater than the 97th percentile is macrocephaly and may indicate hydrocephalus or tumor (may be evaluated with brain imaging); ↓ head circumference less than the 3rd percentile is microcephaly (eg, TORCH infections, fetal alcohol syndrome).

Height and weight: Measured routinely until adulthood. The pattern of growth is more important than the raw numbers. Infants may lose 5% to 10% of birth weight (BW) over the first few days but should return to their BW by 14 days. Infants can be expected to double their BW by 4 to 5 months of age, triple it by 1 year of age, and quadruple it by 2 years of age.

Variants of normal growth:

Constitutional growth delay: A normal variant and the most common cause of delayed puberty. The growth curve for such children lags behind that of others of the same age but remains consistent. There is often a ⊕ family history, and children ultimately achieve target height potential. The key distinguishing feature is delayed bone age until 11 years of age in girls and 13 years of age in boys.

Familial short stature: Short stature (height < second percentile) when one or both parents also have short stature. Growth curve shows a low-to-normal height velocity. Bone age corresponds with chronologic age, and puberty is not delayed. Adult height remains low.

Failure to thrive (FTT): Persistent weight for age and/or length for age less than the fifth percentile, or “falling off the growth curve” (ie, crossing two major percentile lines on a growth chart). FTT is classified as follows: Organic: Caused by an underlying medical condition such as cystic fibrosis,

congenital heart disease (CHD), milk-protein allergy, chronic infection (eg, HIV),

hypothyroidism, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Nonorganic: Primarily caused by psychosocial factors such as low milk supply/breastfeeding problems, inaccurate mixing of formula (too much water mixed in), maternal postpartum depression, neglect, or abuse

Critical to diagnosis: A careful dietary history and close observation of parent-infant interactions. Practitioner should inquire about preparation of formula and feeding practices.

Diagnostic testing: Targeted to suspected etiologies when indicated and no improvement occurs after ensuring adequate nutrition. Imaging modalities include echocardiogram for congenital heart defects and upper gastrointestinal (GI) series for GI causes. Children may need to be hospitalized if there is evidence of neglect or severe

malnourishment. Calorie counts and supplemental nutrition (if breastfeeding is inadequate) are mainstays of treatment for nonorganic causes.
======================================
KEY FACT

Infants with FTT will first fall off the weight curve, then the height curve, and finally the head circumference curve.

KEY FACT

Variants of normal sexual development are as follows:

Precocious puberty: Any sign of secondary sexual maturation in girls <8 years of age or boys <9 years of age. Often idiopathic; may be central or peripheral (see the Gynecology chapter)

Delayed puberty: No testicular enlargement in boys by 14 years of age or no breast development or pubic hair in girls by 13 years of age

Pathologic puberty delay: Caused by systemic disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]), malnutrition (eg, anorexia nervosa), gonadal dysgenesis (eg, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome), or endocrine abnormalities (eg, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, Kallmann syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome)

KEY FACT

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a genetic disorder characterized by an X-linked mutation of the androgen receptor leading to a phenotypically female appearance in a 46,XY individual. Affected individuals will have breast development, cryptorchidism, and no pubic hair. Perform a gonadectomy after puberty to prevent testicular cancer.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS

Autosomal recessive disorder. Mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (chloride channel) on chromosome 7. Characterized by widespread exocrine gland dysfunction. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common severe genetic disease in the United States and is most frequently found in Northern European ancestry.

History/PE

Most patients are diagnosed on newborn screening. Presentation:

Neonates: Meconium ileus (obstruction of the distal ileum caused by abnormally thick meconium; 15% of presenting cases).

Patients <1 year of age: Cough, wheezing, or recurrent respiratory infections. Patients may also have steatorrhea and/or FTT.

Most patients >1 year of age: FTT (caused by pancreatic insufficiency) or chronic sinopulmonary disease/sputum production.

Affected individuals exhibit recurrent pulmonary infections (especially with Pseudomonas

as adults and Staphylococcus aureus as children) with subsequent cyanosis, digital clubbing, chronic cough (the most common pulmonary symptom), dyspnea, bronchiectasis, hemoptysis, chronic sinusitis, rhonchi, rales, and nasal polyposis. Patients with pancreatic insufficiency usually have greasy stools and flatulence; other prominent GI symptoms include pancreatitis, rectal prolapse, hypoproteinemia, biliary cirrhosis, jaundice, and esophageal varices.

Patients who present later in childhood or adulthood are likely to have pancreatic manifestations predominant and have a milder pulmonary course.

Additional symptoms include diabetes mellitus, “salty-tasting” skin, male infertility (agenesis of the vas deferens), and hyponatremia.

Patients are at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (vitamins A, D, E, and K) secondary to malabsorption and may present with manifestations of these deficiencies (eg, night blindness, rickets, neuropathy, coagulopathy).

======================================
KEY FACT

Almost all cases of meconium ileus are caused by CF.

Diagnosis Diagnostic criteria of CF include at least one of the following:

≥1 phenotypic feature(s) of CF Chronic pulmonary disease Chronic sinusitis GI and nutritional abnormalities Salt loss syndromes Obstructive azoospermia

History of CF in sibling Positive newborn screening test

Q

A newborn girl presents with lymphedema of the hands and feet, ↓ femoral pulses, a webbed neck, widely spaced nipples, short fourth metacarpals, and nail dysplasia. What form of hormone replacement therapy will the child need in the future?

PLUS at least one of the following:

↑ sweat chloride concentration Two CFTR gene mutations Abnormal nasal potential difference (NPD) test

Treatment Pulmonary manifestations are managed with chest physical therapy, bronchodilators,

corticosteroids, antibiotics (should cover Pseudomonas and S. aureus; S. aureus is the main colonizer until 20 years of age), and deoxyribonuclease (DNase).

Administer pancreatic enzymes at mealtimes, as well as supplemental fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) due to malabsorption.

Nutritional counseling and support with a high-calorie and high-protein diet are essential for health maintenance.

Patients who have severe disease but can tolerate surgery may be candidates for a lung or pancreas transplant. Life expectancy was once ∼20 years of age, but with newer treatments it is increasing to past 40 years of age.

Ivacaftor, a drug that enhances CFTR membrane localization, was recently approved to treat CF.

NEONATAL JAUNDICE

An elevated serum bilirubin concentration (>5 mg/dL) caused by ↑ hemolysis or ↓ excretion. Subtypes are as follows:

Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia: Always pathologic. Unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia: May be physiologic or pathologic. See

Table 2.12-10 and Figure 2.12-3 for differentiating characteristics.

Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert have problems with CoNjuGation of bilirubin, while Dubin- Johnson and Rotor have a defective DooR for secretion of bilirubin.
======================================
KEY FACT

Breast milk jaundice and breastfeeding jaundice both cause increased enterohepatic circulation of unconjugated bilirubin. It is hypothesized that factors found in breast milk may inhibit hepatic enzyme UGT1A1. Breastfeeding jaundice is due to inadequate milk, → ↑ in enterohepatic circulation. Breastfeeding jaundice occurs in the first week of life, whereas breast milk jaundice peaks in the second week of life. Treatment of breastfeeding jaundice is hydration. Breast milk jaundice does not require treatment, as it resolves with time.

History should focus on diet (breast milk or formula), intrauterine drug exposure, and family history (hemoglobinopathies, enzyme deficiencies, RBC defects).

PE may reveal signs of hepatic or GI dysfunction (abdominal distention, delayed passage of meconium, light-colored stools, dark urine), infection, or birth trauma (cephalohematomas, bruising, pallor, petechiae).

Kernicterus presents with lethargy, poor feeding, a high-pitched cry, hypertonicity, and seizures.

Jaundice may follow a cephalopedal progression as bilirubin concentrations ↑.
======================================
Q

A 3-day-old boy born at 39 weeks’ gestational age via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery has failed to pass meconium and today displays abdominal distention and five episodes of bilious vomiting. Rectal examination shows no stool in the rectal vault. Air contrast enema shows an obstruction at the ileum. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?

Diagnosis For indirect hyperbilirubinemia, complete blood cell count (CBC) with peripheral blood

smear (abnormal RBCs and signs of hemolysis); blood typing of mother and infant (ABO or Rh incompatibility); Coombs test and bilirubin levels

For direct hyperbilirubinemia, liver function tests (LFTs), bile acids, assess liver anatomy and biliary tract via ultrasound and/or hydroxy iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan can confirm suspected cholestatic disease

A jaundiced neonate who is febrile, hypotensive, and/or tachypneic needs a full sepsis workup and intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring

(ICU) monitoring infection). phototherapy elevations >20 mg/dL). Phototherapy is not indicated

Treatment Treat underlying causes (eg, infection). Treat unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy (for mild elevations) or

exchange transfusion (for severe elevations >20 mg/dL). Start phototherapy earlier (10–15 mg/dL) for preterm infants. Phototherapy is not indicated for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and can lead to skin bronzing.

This infant most likely has meconium ileus resulting from CF; however, Hirschsprung disease should remain on the differential diagnosis, as it also can cause delayed meconium passage. Meconium ileus causes obstruction at the level of the ileum, whereas Hirschsprung disease causes rectosigmoid obstruction, and a rectal exam may result in expulsion of stool.

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

Respiratory distress syndrome ([RDS]; also known as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [NRDS]) is the most common cause of respiratory failure in preterm infants (affects >70% of infants born at 28 to 30 weeks GA); it was formerly known as hyaline membrane disease. Surfactant deficiency leads to poor lung compliance, alveolar collapse, and atelectasis. Risk factors include C-section, maternal diabetes mellitus (DM), male sex, and the second born of twins.

Often occurs in preterm infants or low-BW infants due to the fragility of their germinal matrix, a highly vascular region important for fetal neural development. Caused by decreased cerebral blood flow leading to ischemia and reperfusion injury. Many cases (up to 50%) are asymptomatic. More severe cases can be characterized by hypotonia, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and irregular respirations. Germinal matrix hemorrhage can be diagnosed with head ultrasound. Management is often supportive.
======================================
APNEA OF PREMATURITY

Intermittent cessation of respiration for >20 seconds in premature infants (gestational age <37 weeks) due to immaturity of the central respiratory centers. Affects almost all infants with a gestational age <28 weeks. Presents with episodes of intermittent apnea with bradycardia and desaturation in a premature infant who is healthy and well between episodes. Diagnosis is clinical, and alternative causes should be ruled out. Treatment involves noninvasive ventilation and methylxanthines such as caffeine, which stimulate the respiratory drive. Apnea of prematurity resolves with maturity (by 37 weeks in an infant born >28 weeks).

NEONATAL EXTRACRANIAL INJURIES

Extracranial injuries in the newborn often occur secondary to instrumentation injury during delivery. The layers of the head from outermost to innermost are skin, epicranial aponeurosis, periosteum, bone, dura mater, and arachnoid mater. Table 2.12-13 shows the commonly tested extracranial injuries.

resulting in significant treatment is by volume
======================================
CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM

Thyroid hormone deficiency in the neonate, often asymptomatic at birth due to transplacental transfer of maternal thyroxine. Most commonly due to thyroid dysgenesis in the United States. Other causes include thyroid agenesis, iodine deficiency (most common cause in underdeveloped countries), dyshormonogenesis (autosomal recessive), and transfer of maternal antibodies.

History/PE Usually asymptomatic at birth; may cause delayed passage of meconium due to decreased

intestinal motility

Manifestations after decrease of maternal thyroid hormone, including lethargy, hypotonia, large protruding tongue, umbilical hernia, enlarged fontanelle, constipation, jaundice, pale dry skin, and intellectual disability

Diagnosis Newborn screening mandatory with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels 24 to 48 hours. Increased TSH levels indicate hypothyroidism.

Treatment Levothyroxine; avoid coadministration with soy, calcium, and iron due to decreased

absorption

Untreated or delayed treatment of disease causes decreased neurocognitive function (eg, decreased intelligence quotient)

NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME

Withdrawal symptoms in neonates born to females with narcotic dependence during pregnancy. Newborns at high risk include those born to females with poor social support, poor mental health, no prenatal care, intravenous drug use (IVDU) infections (eg, hepatitis C), or mothers requiring chronic prescription opioids.

History/PE It usually presents >24 hours after birth due to withdrawal from transplacental opiates. It

may present earlier if mother used heroin (short half-life).

Central nervous symptoms (CNS) symptoms include shortened sleep-wake cycles, hypertonia, tremor, and suck-swallow incoordination.

Autonomic symptoms include diaphoresis, sneezing, and yawning. Other symptoms include irritability, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Diagnosis/Treatment

Clinical diagnosis; confirmation with drug testing of umbilical cord blood, urine, or stool Mild withdrawal treated with nonpharmacologic approach: Quiet environment, swaddling,

small frequent feeding

Severe withdrawal treated with morphine and methadone followed by tapering and support

CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

Intrauterine risk factors for CHD include maternal illness (DM, phenylketonuria [PKU]), drug use (alcohol, lithium, thalidomide, phenytoin, retinoic acid), and infections (rubella). CHD can also be associated with fetal genetic syndromes. See Table 2.12-15 for a list of common associations with cardiac defects.

CHD is classified by the presence or absence of cyanosis at birth or shortly after:

Acyanotic CHD (“pink babies”): Have left-to-right shunts (oxygenated blood is shunted back into the pulmonary circulation) or no shunt (eg, before congenital obstruction).

Cyanotic CHD (“blue babies”): Have right-to-left shunts (deoxygenated blood is shunted into the systemic circulation). Diagnosed prenatally or immediately after birth. It usually requires urgent surgical treatment and/or maintenance of PDA.

VACTERL-H includes: Vertebral anomalies Anal atresia Cardiac anomalies (ASD, VSD, PDA) Tracheal-esophageal fistula Esophageal atresia Renal structural anomalies Limb anomalies, essentially radii and/or thumbs Hydrocephalus

ACYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART LEFT-TO-RIGHT SHUNTS

May be asymptomatic at birth. The severity of clinical presentation varies with defect size. Each has a characteristic murmur. Ventral septal defect (VSD) is the most common. PDA is less common overall but most common in prematurity. Uncorrected clinically significant left- to-right shunts → ↑ pulmonary blood flow → pathologic remodeling of vasculature → pulmonary arterial hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) → right-left shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome).

KEY FACT

A venous hum is a benign murmur that can be present in childhood. The murmur is a low- pitched, vibratory murmur that is heard near the clavicle throughout the cardiac cycle.

Unlike the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a venous hum murmur is loudest when sitting and disappears with supine position or neck rotation.

SEPTAL DEFECTS

A condition in which a defective opening in the atrial (ASD) or ventricular (VSD) septum allows blood to flow between the atria or ventricles, leading to left-to-right shunting (left-side pressures > right-side pressures). VSD is the most common type of CHD.

======================================
KEY FACT

ASD has a fixed, widely split S2.

Treatment Most small ASDs/VSDs close spontaneously and do not require treatment. Follow-up echocardiography is scheduled based on size of ASD/VSD and physical examination.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is generally not needed before procedures. If congestive heart failure (CHF) develops, best initial treatment involves medical

management of CHF, using the following:

Diuretics Then positive inotropes and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors

Surgical correction is indicated in symptomatic patients who:

Early correction prevents complications such as arrhythmias, right ventricular dysfunction, and Eisenmenger syndrome

PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS

PDA (Fig. 2.12-4) is a failure of the ductus arteriosus to close completely postnatally → left- to-right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. PDA is associated with prematurity and congenital rubella syndrome.

History/PE Patients with large defects may present with FTT, recurrent lower respiratory tract

infections, and CHF.

Examination reveals a continuous “machinery murmur” at the second left intercostal space at the sternal border, a loud S2, a wide pulse pressure, and bounding peripheral pulses. Uncorrected PDA can eventually result in cyanosis (blue toes, normal fingers) through an

Eisenmenger syndrome.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Echocardiogram will demonstrate the defect. Large PDAs will show left

atrial and left ventricular enlargement.

Doppler color flow will demonstrate blood shunting from the aorta into the pulmonary artery.

ECG may show left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and CXR may reveal cardiomegaly with large PDAs.
======================================
Treatment Best initial treatment: Indomethacin (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID])

KEY FACT

Coarctation of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve are associated with Turner syndrome.

KEY FACT

In infants presenting in shock within the first few weeks of life, look for: Sepsis Inborn errors of metabolism Ductal-dependent CHD, usually left-sided lesions Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

COARCTATION OF THE AORTA

Aortic narrowing near insertion of ductus arteriosus (“juxtaductal”), just distal to the left subclavian artery → ↑ flow proximal to and ↓ flow distal to the coarctation (Fig. 2.12-5). Associated with Turner syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve (found in more than two out of three

cases), and intracranial aneurysms. More common among male sex. Complications include heart failure (HF), aortic rupture, endocarditis, and cerebral hemorrhage (due to berry aneurysms).

======================================
Q

A 2-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of shortness of breath and easy fatigability during play. Physical examination is notable for tachypnea and a harsh 2/6 holosystolic murmur over the lower left sternal border. What is the most likely cause of the boy’s symptoms?

In infancy, critical coarctation requires a PDA for survival. Such infants may present in the first few days of life with poor feeding, lethargy, tachypnea, and an eventual shocklike state when the PDA closes. During the newborn screening for coarctation of aorta, differential cyanosis may be seen with lower O2 saturation in the lower extremities (postductal areas) as compared with the right arm (preductal area).

Diagnosis Best initial test: Echocardiography with Doppler color flow. If presenting late in childhood or young adulthood untreated, CXR will demonstrate

cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion (in infants) and rib notching of the chest (see Fig. 2.12-6A) due to enlarged intercostal arteries and the classic “3” sign (see Fig. 2.12-6B) created by aortic wall indentation with pre- and post-stenotic dilatation (in older children and adults).

CYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART RIGHT-TO-LEFT SHUNTS

Patients typically present with central cyanosis soon after birth.

MNEMONIC

Cyanotic heart defects— The five Ts that have right-to-left shunts: Truncus arteriosus (1 arterial vessel overriding ventricles) Transposition of the great arteries (2 arteries switched) Tricuspid atresia (3) Tetralogy of Fallot (4) Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (5 words)

KEY FACT

Cyanotic CHD does not respond to 100% oxygen challenge (minimal effect on Pao2), whereas most lung pathologies will respond to 100% oxygen administration.

This boy probably has a large, untreated VSD that is presenting with CHF. There is less turbulence across a large defect (compared with a small one), leading to a lower-grade murmur.

TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT ARTERIES

Among the more common cyanotic congenital heart conditions in newborns (see Fig. 2.12-7). The aorta arises from the right ventricle (anterior), and the pulmonary trunk arises from the left ventricle (posterior) → separation of pulmonary and systemic circulations. Life is incompatible unless a shunt is present to allow mixing of blood (VSD, PDA, or patent foramen ovale). A PDA alone is usually not sufficient to allow adequate mixing of blood. Risk factors include mothers with preexisting diabetes and, rarely, DiGeorge syndrome.

FIGURE 2.12-7. Complete transposition of the great arteries. Deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is directed to the aorta, and oxygenated blood is directed back to the pulmonary artery. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

History/PE Transposition of the great arteries typically presents within the first few hours after birth. It

is not affected by exertion or supplemental oxygen use. Reverse differential cyanosis (higher postductal saturations than preductal saturations) may be seen if left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (eg, coarctation, aortic stenosis) is also present.

Physical examination reveals tachypnea, progressive hypoxemia, and extreme cyanosis. Patient may have CHF, single loud S2, and a systolic murmur (only if coexisting with VSD).

Diagnosis Best initial test: Echocardiography showing abnormal formation of the great arteries Classic CXR may show a heart with an “egg on a string” appearance
======================================
A

Treatment Best initial treatment: Intravenous PGE1 to maintain or open the PDA To allow some time for growth for a more successful surgical outcome, a balloon atrial

septostomy is performed to create a shunt that is not reliant on the PDA and prostaglandin infusion

Most definitive treatment: Surgical correction (arterial switch operation)

TETRALOGY OF FALLOT

Consists of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, overriding aorta, RVH, and VSD (see Fig. 2.12-8). Among the more common cyanotic CHDs in children. Early cyanosis results from right-to-left shunting across the VSD due to high right-sided pressures from RVOT obstruction. As right-sided pressures ↓ in the weeks after birth, the shunt direction reverses and cyanosis resolves. If the degree of pulmonary stenosis is severe, the right-sided pressures may remain high and cyanosis may persist. Risk factors include trisomy 21 and DiGeorge syndrome.

History/PE TOF presents in infancy or early childhood with dyspnea and fatigability. Cyanosis is

frequently absent at birth but develops over the first 2 years of life; the degree of cyanosis often reflects the extent of RVOT obstruction.

Infants are often asymptomatic until 4 to 6 months of age, when CHF may develop and manifest as diaphoresis with feeding or tachypnea.

Children often squat for relief during hypoxemic episodes called “tet spells,” which ↑ systemic vascular resistance, thus increasing blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature and improving oxygenation.

Hypoxemia may lead to FTT and/or cognitive or developmental delays. PE may reveal a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border due to pulmonic stenosis and/or a harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border due to VSD.
======================================
KEY FACT

Both transposition of the great arteries and tetralogy of Fallot are initially treated with PGE1 but are definitively treated with surgical correction.

Diagnosis Best initial tests: Echocardiography and catheterization. CXR shows a “boot-shaped” heart with ↓ pulmonary vascular markings. Remember that

an isolated VSD, without RVOT, may result in ↑ pulmonary vascular markings.

ECG shows right-axis deviation and RVH.

Treatment Best initial treatment: If there is severe RVOT obstruction or atresia, one must

emergently administer PGE1 to keep the PDA open. This should be done in conjunction with surgical consultation.

Treatment of cyanotic “tet spells” may be treated with supplemental oxygen and placing

the patient in a knee-chest position. If further treatment is needed, IV fluids, opioid analgesia, β-blockers, or α-agonists can be considered, depending on the context. Temporary palliation can be achieved through the creation of an artificial shunt (eg,

balloon atrial septotomy) before beginning the multistep surgical management (modified Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt is often the first step).

PEDIATRIC GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE

PYLORIC STENOSIS

Hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. More common in first-born infant boys; can be associated with tracheoesophageal fistula, formula feeding, and maternal erythromycin ingestion.

History/PE Nonbilious emesis typically begins around 3 to 6 weeks of age and progresses to projectile

nonbilious emesis after most or all feedings.

Infants are hungry after episodes of vomiting; they initially feed well but eventually suffer from dehydration and malnutrition.

PE may reveal a palpable, olive-shaped, mobile, nontender epigastric mass and visible gastric peristaltic waves.

Diagnosis

Best initial test: Abdominal ultrasound will reveal a thickened, elongated pylorus (see Fig. 2.12-9).

Emesis results in loss of HCl and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

Activation of the RAAS enhances renal K+ and H+ secretion in the collecting duct. The resulting lab abnormalities include hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Keeping the patient NPO (nothing by mouth), establishing IV

access, and correcting dehydration and acid-base/electrolyte abnormalities

Definitive treatment: Surgical correction with pyloromyotomy
======================================
INTUSSUSCEPTION

A condition in which a portion of the bowel invaginates, or “telescopes,” into an adjacent segment, usually proximal to the ileocecal valve (see Fig. 2.12-10). The most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between 6 months and 3 years of age (boys > girls). Etiology is unclear in most children. Risk factors include conditions with potential lead points, including Meckel diverticulum, intestinal lymphoma (>6 years of age), submucosal hematoma (as in Henoch-Schönlein purpura), polyps, and CF (lead point is inspissated stool). An antecedent viral GI illness or upper respiratory infection (URI) is seen in many children, which may cause formation of a lead point through enlargement of Peyer patches (lymphatic tissue in the bowel). There is a small risk of intussusception after the oral rotavirus vaccine.

The classic triad involves severe abdominal pain, vomiting (initially nonbilious and then bilious as obstruction develops), and bloody mucus in stool (“currant jelly stool,” a late finding). However, this classic triad is only present in one third of patients.

During examination, the physician should look for abdominal tenderness, a ⊕ stool guaiac test, a palpable “sausage-shaped” right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal mass, and “empty” right lower quadrant (RLQ) on palpation (Dance sign).
======================================
Q

A 4-week-old boy, born at term, is brought to the emergency department after experiencing vomiting of increasing frequency and intensity for the past week. His parents state that he now vomits forcefully after every meal and enthusiastically attempts to eat immediately after vomiting. The infant appears lethargic, with sunken fontanelles and decreased skin turgor. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended; no masses are felt. What is the most likely cause of this infant’s symptoms?

Diagnosis/Treatment Ultrasonography is the initial test of choice and may show a “target sign” (see Fig. 2.12-

10B). An ultrasound must be conducted during a painful episode to diagnose intussusception.

X-rays of the abdomen are often normal early in the disease, but later they may show small bowel obstruction, perforation, or a soft tissue mass.

The physician should correct any volume or electrolyte abnormalities, check CBC for

leukocytosis, and consider placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube for decompression.

High clinical suspicion calls for an air insufflation enema without delay, as it is diagnostic and curative in the vast majority of patients.

Surgical resection is indicated if the child has peritoneal signs, air insufflation enema reduction is unsuccessful, or a pathologic lead point is identified.

Air insufflation enema is preferred over water or barium-contrast enema for diagnosis and management of intussusception, as it is faster and carries a lower risk for complications.

MALROTATION WITH VOLVULUS

Congenital malrotation of the midgut results in abnormal positioning of the small intestine (cecum in the right hypochondrium) and formation of fibrous bands known as Ladd bands (Fig. 2.12-11), which predispose to obstruction and volvulus with constriction of blood flow.

History/PE Often presents in the first month of life with bilious emesis, crampy abdominal pain,

distention, and passage of blood or mucus in the stool.

Postsurgical adhesions can lead to obstruction and volvulus at any point in life.

Diagnosis Barium contrast enema may reveal the characteristic narrowed “bird-beak” appearance and

air-fluid levels, but may also appear normal.

Upper GI series is the study of choice if the patient is stable and shows an abnormal location of the ligament of Treitz. Ultrasound may be used, but sensitivity depends on the user’s experience.

Treatment NG tube insertion to decompress the intestine; IV fluid hydration Emergent surgical correction is needed when there is ischemic bowel/GI tract; definitive

management is surgical (Ladd’s procedure)
======================================
MECKEL DIVERTICULUM

Caused by failure of the omphalomesenteric (or vitelline) duct to obliterate, resulting in the formation of a true diverticulum containing all three layers of the small intestine (Fig. 2.12- 12). Some Meckel diverticula have heterotopic gastric tissue, which places patients at risk for

intestinal ulceration and painless hematochezia. This is the most common congenital abnormality of the small intestine, affecting up to 2% of children (boys > girls).

HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE

Characterized by congenital lack of ganglion cells in the distal colon. This leads to decreased motility caused by unopposed smooth muscle tone in the absence of enteric relaxing reflexes and uncoordinated peristalsis (see Fig. 2.12-13). Associated with male sex, Down syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (RET gene mutation).

Filling defects in the descending/sigmoid colon represent feces (blue arrow). (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

History/PE Presentation depends on the extent of the aganglionic segment. Neonates present with failure to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth, accompanied by bilious vomiting and FTT; children with less severe lesions may present later in life with chronic constipation.

PE may reveal abdominal distention and explosive discharge of stool after a rectal examination; lack of stool in the rectum; and/or abnormal sphincter tone.

Diagnosis

Best initial test: X-rays reveal distended bowel loops with a paucity of air in the rectum. Barium enema is the imaging study of choice and reveals a narrowed distal colon with proximal dilation (rectosigmoid transition zone). This test differentiates Hirschsprung disease from meconium ileus (seen in CF patients), which would show a microcolon on barium enema testing.

Anorectal manometry detects failure of the internal sphincter to relax after distention of the rectal lumen. It is typically used in atypical presentations or older children.

Most accurate test: Rectal suction biopsy confirms the diagnosis and reveals absence of the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus and submucosal (Meissner) plexus along with hypertrophied nerve trunks enhanced with acetylcholinesterase stain.

KEY FACT

Definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease requires a rectal suction biopsy.

Treatment Traditionally a two-stage surgical correction is used, involving the creation of a diverting colostomy at the time of diagnosis, followed several weeks later by a definitive “pull- through” procedure connecting the remaining colon to the rectum.

======================================
NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS

A condition in which a portion of the bowel (most commonly the terminal ileum/proximal colon) undergoes necrosis. NEC is the most common GI emergency in neonates; it is most frequently seen in premature infants, but can rarely occur in full-term infants as well. Risk factors include low BW, hypotension, and enteral feeding (especially formula) in the context of a prematurity or compromised enteral blood flow.

History/PE Symptoms usually present within the first few days or weeks of life and are nonspecific. They include feeding intolerance, delayed gastric emptying, abdominal distention, and bloody stools.

Symptoms can rapidly progress to intestinal perforation, peritonitis, abdominal erythema, and shock. The physician should maintain a high index of suspicion.

Diagnosis Lab findings are nonspecific and may show hyponatremia, metabolic (lactic) acidosis,

leukopenia or leukocytosis with left shift, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC] with prolonged prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time [PT/aPTT] and a ⊕ D-dimer).

X-rays of the abdomen are the imaging modality of choice and may show dilated bowel loops, pneumatosis intestinalis (“train track lucency”; see Fig. 2.12-14), portal venous gas, or abdominal free air (in the case of bowel perforation). Serial x-rays of the abdomen should be taken every 6 hours.

Ultrasound may also be helpful in discerning free air, areas of loculation, and bowel necrosis.

KEY FACT

is pathognomonic for supportive measures, of dehydration and IV antibiotics.

Pneumatosis intestinalis on x-rays is pathognomonic for NEC in neonates.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Initiate supportive measures, including NPO, an NG tube for gastric decompression, correction of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and IV antibiotics.

Indications for surgery are perforation (free air under the diaphragm) or worsening radiographic signs on serial abdominal x-rays. An ileostomy with mucous fistula is typically performed, with a reanastomosis at a later time.

Complications include formation of intestinal strictures and short-bowel syndrome.
======================================
FOOD PROTEIN–INDUCED ALLERGIC PROCTOCOLITIS

Food protein–induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is a condition whereby specific food proteins (most commonly cow’s milk or soy) cause inflammation of the colon via a non-IgE- mediated allergic reaction. This can occur in both breastfed and formula-fed infants and usually presents within the first few months of life.

History/PE Patients presents with increased volume of loose stools with mucus and painless

hematochezia.

Examination shows an afebrile, well-appearing infant, with blood- or mucus-streaked stools, and when the condition is severe, the patient may show impaired growth or failure to thrive.

Evaluation/Treatment

Diagnosis is clinical, based on history, PE, and successful treatment. There should be notable absence of symptoms such as fever, lethargy, abdominal pain, or physical examination findings such as anal fissures or abdominal masses.

Symptoms will resolve after removal of the antigen from the diet. In a breastfed baby, the mother has to eliminate ingestion of cow’s milk, soy, or other suspected antigens. A formula-fed infant can switch to a hydrolyzed, hypoallergenic formula.

PEDIATRIC CONSTIPATION

Passage of hard stool less frequently than is appropriate for age. Bowel movements may be difficult or painful to pass. Neonates should pass meconium within 48 hours of birth. Pediatric constipation can be divided into functional and pathologic constipation. Functional constipation is responsible for 95% of cases in healthy children greater than 1 year of age.

History/PE Painful passage of hard, large-caliber stools or pelletlike stools. May have encopresis

(involuntary leakage of soft stool around retained hard stool)

Abdominal distention, bowel sounds hyperactive or hypoactive, depending on the

underlying cause Stool withholding Associated enuresis and urinary frequency if bladder is compressed by enlarged rectum Palpation of hard mass of stool possible if fecal impaction occurs

frequency possible if fecal impaction in the absence of initiation of,solid food/cow’s school. passage of meconium;

Differential Diagnosis Functional constipation: Constipation in the absence of an anatomic abnormality or

disease. Risk factors include initiation of solid food/cow’s milk, periods of transition such as toilet training, and starting school.

Hirschsprung disease: Delayed passage of meconium; may present later in childhood with chronic constipation

CF: Inspissated meconium and chronic constipation Infant dyschezia: Failure to relax pelvic muscles and coordinate defecation. It presents as prolonged straining and crying with delayed passage of soft stools in an infant younger than 9 months. It resolves spontaneously with maturity.

Spinal dysraphism and hypothyroidism.

Diagnosis It is important to get a thorough history regarding passage of meconium, dietary habits,

onset of toilet training, and schooling.

Organic causes of constipation should be ruled out to diagnose functional constipation. If alarm signs are present, the physician should further evaluate the patient, based on suspected etiology.

Alarm signs include delayed passage of meconium, fever, ribbon stools, poor growth, severe abdominal distention, abnormal examination such as tuft at gluteal cleft, and increased sphincter tone.

Treatment The mainstay of treating pediatric constipation is prevention, including adequate fiber and

water intake, as well as using a child-oriented approach to toilet training.
======================================
Q

A 4-day-old boy born at 31 weeks for intrauterine growth restriction has experienced frequent bilious vomiting after formula feeding for the past 24 hours and has passed stool mixed with bright red blood twice today. He was initially tolerating his NG feeds well, but he now demonstrates lethargy, abdominal distention, and decreased bowel sounds. What is the most likely diagnosis, and what would the physician expect to see on x-rays of the abdomen?

Patients with episodic constipation, including stool withholding, may be treated with dietary changes and osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol. Chronic functional constipation is treated with a combination of dietary changes, laxatives, and bowel retraining until laxative doses can be tapered.

Therapies for organic constipation are targeted to the specific cause.

KEY FACT

Posterior urethral valves are the most common congenital urethral obstruction in newborn males. Classic findings are a male infant with a distended, palpable bladder; low urine output; and/or a weak urinary stream. Severe in-utero cases may lead to oligohydramnios with resultant Potter’s sequence.

PEDIATRIC UROLOGY  VESICOURETERAL REFLUX 

Retrograde projection of urine from the bladder to the ureters and kidneys. May be primary reflux (from abnormal/insufficient insertion of ureter into the bladder) or secondary reflux (from congenital bladder outlet obstruction, such as posterior urethral valves, or from neurogenic bladder). Classified as follows:

Mild reflux (grades I–II): Reflux into one or both ureters (I) or kidneys (II) but no ureteral or renal pelvic dilation. It often resolves spontaneously.

Moderate to severe reflux (grades III–V): Ureteral dilation (III), renal pelvis and calyceal dilation (IV) with associated calicyeal blunting (V) and possible nephropathy (impaired renal function in severe cases.

History/PE May present in infancy or childhood with febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) with particular concern for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) if recurrent febrile UTIs. Prenatal ultrasonography may identify hydronephrosis.

Diagnosis VCUG is diagnostic test of choice to detect abnormalities at ureteral insertion sites and to classify the grade of reflux (see Fig. 2.12-15).

FIGURE 2.12-15. Vesicoureteral reflux. Frontal x-ray from a voiding cystourethrogram shows reflux to the left ureter and intrarenal collecting system with hydronephrosis. Note the absence of reflux on the normal right side. (Reproduced with permission from Doherty GM. Current Diagnosis & Treatment: Surgery, 13th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

Treatment The physician should have a low threshold to treat UTIs with prompt initiation of

antibiotics.

threshold to treat is generally reserved UTIs and-VUR, daily febrile UTIs but not children with recurrent

Surgery (ureteral reimplantation) is generally reserved for children with symptomatic high-grade (III–V) reflux.

In children with recurrent febrile UTIs and VUR, daily antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the number of febrile UTIs but not prevent renal scarring. This benefit has not been demonstrated for children with recurrent febrile UTIs without VUR.
======================================
KEY FACT

Children 2 to 24 months of age with a febrile UTI should first have an ultrasound exam to evaluate the anatomy of the urinary tract. A VCUG is indicated for recurrent febrile UTIs and abnormalities on ultrasound. For children <2 months, imaging is also recommended but evidence is limited.

This infant most likely has necrotizing enterocolitis, given his presentation and risk factors (prematurity, formula feeding). This is a serious diagnosis with up to 40% mortality. X-ray findings can include pneumatosis intestinalis, air in the portal venous system, and free air under the diaphragm (in case of bowel perforation).

CRYPTORCHIDISM

Failure of one or both testes to fully descend into the scrotum. Prematurity is a risk factor.

History/PE

A

Risk factors for cryptorchidism include prematurity, congenital urinary tract abnormalities, and certain syndromes (eg, Prader-Willi, Noonan syndromes). If not treated, it is associated with oligospermia and infertility, as well as malignancy.

Diagnosis The testes cannot be manipulated into the scrotal sac with gentle pressure (vs retractile testes) and can be palpated anywhere along the inguinal canal.

Treatment Orchiopexy for prepubertal boys; orchiectomy vs close observation if discovered after puberty to minimize the risk for testicular cancer. If the condition is discovered in a newborn, surgery should be performed as soon as possible after 4 months of age—imperatively before 2 years of age and ideally before 1 year of age. Earlier treatment has been found to improve fertility and decrease the risk of testicular cancer and testicular torsion.

KEY FACT

In cryptorchidism, bringing the testes into the scrotum may lower, but not eliminate, the risk for testicular cancer.

INGUINAL HERNIA

History/PE Inguinal hernia is most commonly indirect in children. The condition has a prevalence of 1% to 5% in newborns and almost double that in premature newborns. The prevalence is three to four times higher in male newborns.
======================================
Diagnosis Hernia: Intermittent protrusion of abdominal contents through an abdominal wall opening.

Can be either direct or indirect.

Direct inguinal hernia: passes medial to the epigastric vessels, behind the superficial inguinal ring and rarely enters the scrotum.

Indirect inguinal hernia: passes through the inguinal canal, lateral to the epigastric vessels.

Incarceration: Entrapment of hernia that is not reducible. Strangulation: Ischemia and possible necrosis of the contents of the hernia, resulting in

intestinal perforation.

Treatment Reduction of the hernia and timely referral to a surgeon. Risk of incarceration and strangulation are high, especially under 1 year of age.

HYPOSPADIAS AND EPISPADIAS

Both conditions are congenital malformations of the male urethra resulting in an abnormal opening. See Table 2.12-17 and Figure 2.12-16. Immunodeficiencies can also increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections (see Figure 2.12-17.)

======================================
KEY FACT

Circumcision refers to the removal of the prepuce of the penis. Newborn circumcision generally has fewer complications and a shorter recovery period

than circumcision beyond the neonatal period.

Circumcision has several potentilal benefits, eg, reduction in UTIs, STIs, and penile malignancy.

Complications (rare) include bleeding, infection, ulceration, cosmetic issues, and stenosis.

KEY FACT

Enuresis: Involuntary voiding of urine. This can be primary, caused by immaturity of the reflex to awaken in response to a full

bladder.

Evaluation for secondary causes can become necessary (UTI, anatomic abnormality of the urinary tract).

Treatment is not always necessary, but enuresis alarms are generally considered the first- line option in primary enuresis.

B-cell deficiencies: Most common (50%). Typically present after 6 months of age with recurrent sinopulmonary, GI infections, and/or with encapsulated organisms (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis). Treatment calls for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), except for cases of IgA deficiency.

Bruton agammaglobulinemia can be confused with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI), as both are characterized by ↑ susceptibility to infections at ∼6 months of age, when transplacental maternal IgG is no longer active. B cells are ↓ in Bruton, whereas those in THI are normal.

Bruton agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) also have similar symptoms. However, the former is found in boys ∼6 months of age, whereas CVID is seen in older males and females (15–35 years of age), and its symptoms are less severe.

T-cell deficiencies: Tend to present earlier (1–3 months of age) with opportunistic and low-grade fungal, viral, and intracellular bacterial infections (eg, mycobacteria). Secondary b-cell dysfunction can also be seen.

Phagocyte deficiencies: Characterized by mucous membrane infections, abscesses, and poor wound healing. Infections with catalase ⊕ organisms (eg, S. aureus), fungi, and gram ⊖ enteric organisms are common.

Complement deficiencies: These deficiencies are characterized by recurrent bacterial

infections with encapsulated organisms.
======================================
KEY FACT

Flashback to immunology: B cells make immunoglobulins and are responsible for immunity against extracellular

bacteria.

T cells are responsible for immunity against intracellular bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

KAWASAKI DISEASE

Complications: Untreated children may develop coronary artery aneurysms (25%); all patients should be assessed by echocardiography at diagnosis.

An acute multisystem medium-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects young children. Usually affects children age <5 years (↑ incidence in people of Japanese and Korean descent). Kawasaki disease is divided into acute, subacute, and convalescent phases.

MNEMONIC

Kawasaki disease symptoms— CRASH and BURN Conjunctivitis (without discharge) Rash Adenopathy (unilateral and >1.5 cm) Strawberry tongue Hands and feet (red, swollen, flaky skin) BURN (fever >40°C [>104°F] for ≥5 days) 

History/PE Five days of fever and at least four of the following five criteria:

1. Conjunctivitis: Bilateral, nonexudative, painless with limbal sparing (acute phase) 2. Oral mucosal changes: Erythematous mouth/pharynx, “strawberry tongue,” and/or

cracked lips (acute phase)

3. Rash: Primarily truncal, polymorphous, erythematous (acute phase) 4. Peripheral extremity changes: Edema of hands and feet, palmar erythema (acute phase),

and desquamating palms and soles (convalescent phase)

5. Cervical lymphadenopathy (>1.5 cm): Generally painful and unilateral (acute phase) Other manifestations (not required for diagnosis) include sterile pyuria, gallbladder hydrops, hepatitis, and arthritis, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia

KEY FACT

Untreated Kawasaki disease can lead to coronary aneurysms in up to 25% of patients.

Diagnosis Laboratory workup: Normochromic anemia, leukocytosis with left shift, thrombocytosis,

increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).

The physician should obtain a baseline echocardiogram at diagnosis for longitudinal follow-up of coronary artery morphology. Follow-up of uncomplicated cases should occur at 2 weeks and 6 to 8 weeks after diagnosis.
======================================
KEY FACT

Kawasaki disease and scarlet fever may both present with “strawberry tongue,” rash, desquamation of the hands and feet, and erythema of the mucous membranes. However, children with scarlet fever have normal lips and no conjunctivitis.

Treatment Best initial treatment: High-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]), for anti-

inflammatory, antipyretic, and antithrombotic effects and IVIG to reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysms from 25% to <5%.

Low-dose ASA is then continued until normalization of laboratory inflammatory markers. Aspirin is continued if children develop coronary aneurysms. Although young children taking ASA are at risk for Reye syndrome, the risk/benefit favors treatment with ASA to prevent coronary artery aneurysms.

coronary syndrome, the risk/benefit IVIG-refractory cases, in the pediatric

Corticosteroids may be used in IVIG-refractory cases, but routine use is not recommended.

KEY FACT

ASA is used for Kawasaki disease in the pediatric population, despite fear of Reye syndrome, a rare but serious condition. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, Reye syndrome results from mitochondrial injury and fatty degenerative liver failure, which leads to hyperammonemia and ultimately encephalopathy.

JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS

An autoimmune disorder manifesting as arthritis with “morning stiffness” and gradual loss of motion that is present for at least 6 weeks in a patient <16 years of age. Formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Approximately 95% of cases are resolved by puberty. This disorder is more common in girls than in boys. The most common clinical and laboratory findings of different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are described in Table 2.12-19.

Q

A 2-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for a skin infection that started on his chin and rapidly spread to involve much of his face and neck. This is his third such infection this year, and he is constantly plagued by sinus infections and bouts of pneumonia. There is no family history of recurrent infections. The patient appears uncomfortable, and dermatologic exam is notable for erosions coated in yellow crust that are widespread across the patient’s face and neck. He also has patchy white pigmentation of the skin, light blonde hair, and blue eyes. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Treatment Best initial treatments: NSAIDs and strengthening exercises Corticosteroids (for myocarditis) and immunosuppressive medications (methotrexate,

anti–tumor necrosis factor agents such as etanercept) are second-line agents

PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE

ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA

A suppurative infection of the middle ear cavity that is common in children. Sixty percent of children will develop one or more episodes of AOM before 4 years of age. Common pathogens include S pneumoniae; nontypeable H influenzae; Moraxella catarrhalis; and viruses such as influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus.

History/PE Symptoms include ear pain, fever, crying, irritability, difficulty feeding or sleeping, vomiting, and diarrhea. Young children may tug on their ears.

Risk Factors Family history, day care, and tobacco smoke and air pollution exposure. Rate peaks

between 6 and 12 months of age.

Protective factors: Breastfeeding, oral xylitol.

Diagnosis Diagnosis is made clinically.

Otoscopic examination reveals an erythematous tympanic membrane (TM) effusion, bulging, or retraction of the TM and ↓ TM mobility (test with an insufflator bulb). Viral causes may result in serous otitis media with blue-gray bulging membranes.

Serous otitis media is the presence of effusion without active infection. Examination shows a dull TM.

Treatment Best initial treatment: For mild cases of unilateral otitis media in children >6 months of

age, treatment options include supportive care (pain and fever control) and close follow-up rather than antibiotics.

mg/kg/day) for 10 days for empiric therapy. Patients with recent amoxicillin use and those with resistant or recurrent cases may require amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. If patient is allergic to penicillin, the physician can consider cephalosporin (mild delayed reaction) or azithromycin (immediate serious or delayed reaction).

Complications include TM perforation, mastoiditis, meningitis, cholesteatomas, and chronic otitis media. Recurrent otitis media can cause hearing loss with resultant speech and language delay. Chronic otitis media may require tympanostomy tubes.

This child most likely has Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, caused by autosomal recessive defects in the synthesis/maintenance of storage granules in a number of cell types (including leukocytes, platelets, neutrophils, and melanocytes). In addition to partial oculocutaneous albinism, these patients experience hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent, serious infections of the skin and respiratory tract by S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and
======================================
A

Pneumococcus species. Chédiak-Higashi syndrome is often fatal in childhood because of overwhelming infection.

BRONCHIOLITIS

An acute inflammatory illness of the small airways of the lower respiratory tract that primarily affects infants and children <2 years of age, often in the fall or winter. RSV is the most common cause; others include parainfluenza, influenza, metapneumovirus, and other viruses. Progression to respiratory failure is a potentially fatal complication. Risk factors for severe RSV infection include <6 months of age, prematurity, heart or lung disease, neuromuscular disease, and immunodeficiency.

KEY FACT

Toddlers and older infants are at risk for foreign body aspiration. Sudden-onset wheezing or respiratory distress are often characteristic. Objects that cause airway compromise or that cause mucosal damage (batteries) should be removed immediately with bronchoscopy.

History/PE Presentation:

rhinorrhea, cough. impaired central respiratory distress, tachypnea, hypoxia. retractions, crackles wheezing most sensitive vital

Days 1 to 3: Low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, cough. Young infants might have apnea. This is believed to be due to impaired central respiratory center function in the setting of the stress of infection.

Days 4 to 6: Respiratory distress, tachypnea, hypoxia.

PE: Tachypnea, hypoxia, intercostal retractions, crackles or coarse breath sounds (“washing machine sounds”), ± wheezing

An ↑ respiratory rate: Earliest and most sensitive vital sign change

KEY FACT

RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis. Parainfluenza is the most common cause of croup.

Diagnosis Bronchiolitis is predominantly a clinical diagnosis. Routine cases do not need any

laboratory or radiologic workup.

In severe cases, a CXR can be obtained to rule out pneumonia. The x-ray may show hyperinflation of the lungs with a flattened diaphragm, interstitial infiltrates, and/or atelectasis.

Nasopharyngeal aspirate to test for RSV and other viruses is highly sensitive and specific but has little effect on management (infants should be treated for bronchiolitis whether or not a virus is identified).
======================================
KEY FACT

Young infants are at risk for apnea as a result of RSV bronchiolitis.

Treatment Treatment for bronchiolitis is primarily supportive with hydration, suctioning, and

supplemental O2.

For patients with a history or strong family history of asthma, treatment with bronchodilators may be considered, and if symptoms improve, may be continued.

Hospitalization of patient is necessary if infant’s hypoxia and/or tachypnea interfere with feeding or if signs of severe illness are present.

Corticosteroids are not indicated. Ribavirin is an antiviral drug sometimes used in high-risk infants with underlying heart, lung, or immune disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against the use of ribavirin in otherwise healthy children.

RSV prophylaxis with injectable monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab) is recommended in the fall/winter for high-risk patients ≤2 years of age (eg, those with a history of prematurity, chronic lung disease, or CHD).

CROUP (LARYNGOTRACHEOBRONCHITIS)

An acute viral inflammatory disease of the larynx, primarily within the subglottic space. Pathogens include parainfluenza virus types 1 (most common), 2, and 3; RSV; influenza; and adenovirus. Rarely, bacterial superinfection may develop, causing tracheitis.

superinfection may develop, followed-by low-grade agitation, a hoarse

History/PE Prodromal URI symptoms are typically followed by low-grade fever, mild dyspnea, inspiratory stridor that worsens with agitation, a hoarse voice, and a characteristic barking cough that worsens at night.

Diagnosis Croup is diagnosed by clinical impression. The diagnosis is often based on the degree of

stridor and respiratory distress.

An anteroposterior x-ray of the neck may show the classic “steeple sign” from subglottic narrowing (see Fig. 2.12-18), but this finding is neither sensitive nor specific.

Treatment Mild cases: Outpatient management with cool-mist therapy and fluids Moderate cases: May require supplemental O2, oral or intramuscular (IM) corticosteroids,

and nebulized racemic epinephrine

Severe cases (eg, respiratory distress at rest, inspiratory stridor, accessory neck muscle use): Hospitalization and nebulized racemic epinephrine. The physician should consider intubation if there is danger of airway compromise.

EPIGLOTTITIS

A serious and rapidly progressive infection of supraglottic structures (eg, the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds). Before immunization, H influenzae type b was the primary pathogen. Common causes now include Streptococcus species, nontypeable H influenzae, and viral agents, but this is now a very rare infection in the postvaccine era.

History/PE Epiglottitis presents with acute-onset high fever (39–40°C [102–104°F]), dysphagia,

drooling, a muffled voice, inspiratory retractions, cyanosis, and soft stridor.

Patients sit with the neck hyperextended and the chin protruding (“sniffing dog” position) and lean forward in a “tripod” position to maximize air entry.

======================================
KEY FACT

Onn

Epiglottitis is a true emergency and can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction. Time should not be wasted on ordering an x-ray.

MENINGITIS

Bacterial meningitis most often occurs in children <3 years of age; common organisms include S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and Escherichia coli. Enteroviruses are the most common agents of viral meningitis, and they infect children of all ages. Risk factors for bacterial meningitis include sinofacial infections, trauma, immunodeficiency, and sepsis.

Most common causes of bacterial meningitis by age are as follows:

Neonates: Group B Streptococcus (GBS), E coli, Listeria Infants/children: S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, H influenzae Adolescents: N meningitidis, S pneumoniae

History/PE Bacterial meningitis in older children classically presents with the triad of headache, high

fever, and nuchal rigidity. Infants can present with fever and irritability.

Viral meningitis is typically preceded by a prodromal illness that includes fever, upper respiratory symptoms, and fatigue.

Kernig sign (reluctance of knee extension when the hip is flexed) and Brudzinski sign (hips are flexed in response to forced flexion of the neck) are nonspecific signs of meningeal irritation in older children, but not in infants.

Additional PE findings may include signs of ↑ intracranial pressure ([ICP] papilledema, cranial nerve palsies) or a petechial rash (N meningitidis). Signs in neonates include lethargy, hyperthermia or hypothermia, poor tone, a bulging fontanelle, and vomiting.

KEY FACT

Don’t be fooled—infants rarely have meningeal signs such as Kernig or Brudzinski signs or nuchal rigidity because of their open fontanelle, which helps relieve the increased ICP.

Diagnosis The physician should obtain a CT scan of the head to rule out ↑ ICP (risk for brainstem

herniation) if the patient is at high risk (eg, exhibits neurologic deficits or has papilledema on funduscopic exam); however, this is not typically needed in infants because the open fontanelle makes an increase of ICP less of an issue.

The physician should arrange for a lumbar puncture (LP) and send diagnostic testing, including cell count with differential, glucose and protein levels, Gram stain, and culture.

In bacterial meningitis, findings include high WBC, low glucose, high protein, ⊕ Gram stain, and ⊕ culture.

may just have a high\WBC and cefotaxime or (eg, if the mother had

In viral meningitis, the patient may just have a high WBC level with normal to high protein.

Treatment Treat neonates with ampicillin and cefotaxime or gentamicin. Consider acyclovir if there is concern for herpes encephalitis (eg, if the mother had herpes simplex virus [HSV] lesions at the time of the infant’s birth or if the infant has an extremely bloody, nontraumatic LP).

Give older children ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
======================================
KEY FACT

Neonates should not be given ceftriaxone in light of the ↑ risk for biliary sludging and kernicterus.

OCULAR INFECTIONS OF THE NEONATE

Infectious conjunctivitis is transmitted as the neonate passes through the birth canal during labor, and the infection often presents during the first weeks of life. The most common causative agents include Chlamydia trachomatis and HSV (usually HSV-2). Neisseria gonorrhoeae was much more common before the routine use of prophylaxis. Now it causes <1% of cases of neonatal conjunctivitis in the United States. Erythromycin ointment is recommended as first-line prophylaxis. Silver nitrate is more effective for penicillinase- productive N gonorrhoeae.

History/PE Table 2.12-22 summarizes the clinical presentation of common neonatal ocular infections.

TABLE 2.12-22. Ocular Infections in the Neonatal Period

CAUSATIVE AGENT CHARACTERISTICS TREATMENT Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Herpes simplex virus Symptoms appear 1-2 weeks after birth Presents with eyelid swelling and relatively scant watery discharge Symptoms appear within 1 week of birth Bilateral purulent conjunctivitis and marked eyelid edema Tends to be more severe than chlamydial conjunctivitis Symptoms appear within 2 weeks of birth Presents with conjunctival injection, watery/ serosanguineous eye discharge, and vesicular eruptions surrounding the eyes Topical erythromycin ointment and oral erythromycin Topical antibiotics alone are insufficient, as sys- temic infection is often present IV/IM third-generation cephalosporin Gonococcal coverage is crucial if the causative agent is unknown, as corneal ulceration (and resultant scarring) can occur within 24-48 hours \V acyclovir for 14- to 21-day course, along with a topical agent (such as vidarabine)

Diagnosis Bacterial cultures and Gram stain represent the gold standard for suspected gonococcal or

chlamydial conjunctivitis.

HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic standard for children with corneal ulceration or for those with a vesicular eruption anywhere on the body.

undergo cervical Gram:stain cause of conjunctivitis. cultureesults are Table 212-22.

The neonate’s mother should undergo cervical Gram stain and culture if a sexually transmitted infection is the suspected cause of conjunctivitis.

Treatment Empiric treatment can start before culture results are known. Specific treatments are listed in Table 2.12-22.
======================================
PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH)

A highly infectious form of bronchitis caused by the encapsulated gram ⊖ bacillus Bordetella pertussis. The diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTAP) vaccine (given in five doses in early childhood) is protective, but immunity wanes by adolescence, and so booster vaccination is recommended every 10 years. Adolescents and young adults serve as the primary reservoir for pertussis; a physician should not exclude it as a diagnosis in young adults with paroxysms of cough. Transmission is through aerosol droplets and requires airborne precautions with a mask. Pertussis can be life-threatening for young infants but is generally a milder infection in older children and adults.

History/PE Has the following three stages:

Catarrhal (mild URI symptoms; lasts 1–2 weeks) Paroxysmal (paroxysms of cough with inspiratory whoop and post-tussive emesis; lasts

2–3 months)

Convalescent (symptoms wane)

Patients most often present in the paroxysmal stage, but are most contagious in the catarrhal stage

KEY FACT

The classic presentation of pertussis is an infant <6 months of age with paroxysmal coughing, post-tussive emesis, and apnea. The typical “whooping” cough is usually absent at this age.

Diagnosis Labs show an elevated WBC count with lymphocytosis (often ≥70%) Most accurate test: Nasopharyngeal culture or PCR

Treatment Hospitalize infants <6 months of age. Give azithromycin for 10 days to patients. Exposed newborns are at high risk irrespective

of their immunization status because they may not be entirely protected by maternal transplacental immunoglobulins.

Close contacts (including day care contacts) should receive prophylactic antibiotics (azithromycin for 5 days).

TORCH INFECTIONS

Refer to the Obstetrics chapter.

PINWORM INFECTION

Caused by Enterobius vermicularis. Pinworm is a parasitic infection that causes perianal pruritus, which is more pronounced at night. Diagnosis is made with the tape test (clear tape is pressed to the anal region in the morning and observed under the microscope for pinworm eggs). The patient and all household contacts should be treated with albendazole or pyrantel pamoate.

Pinworm is a parasitic at night. Diagnosisis morning and observed contacts should be DAYS-OLD)

NEONATAL FEVER (<28 DAYS OLD)

Fever is defined as a rectal temperature ≥38°C (≥100.4°F) One of the most common indications for hospitalization Neonates have a high risk of invasive bacterial infection (IBI) or a viral infection; most

severe is HSV

Presentation of illness can be subtle with history of poor feeding, lethargy, and decreased activity

Diagnosis CBC with differential; complete metabolic panel; cultures of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
======================================
Most common bacterial pathogens:

Early onset (< 30 days): Predominantly GBS infection, followed by gram ⊖ organisms (predominantly E coli), and Listeria

Late onset (>30 days): Predominantly GBS infection, followed by gram ⊖ organisms (predominantly E coli)

Treatment Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with ampicillin and cefotaxime

FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN

Refers to children with a fever ≥38.3°C (>101°F) for at least 8 days without apparent diagnosis after a careful history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment

dysfunction, and oncologic disease, especially leukemia Often a common disorder with an uncommon presentation

PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIC DISEASE

CEREBRAL PALSY

A group of nonhereditary, nonprogressive disorders of muscle tone; the most common movement disorder in children. Often results from prenatal, perinatal, or neonatal neurologic insult, but in most cases stems from unknown cause. Risk factors of cerebral palsy (CP) include low BW, intrauterine exposure to maternal infection, prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, trauma, brain malformation, and neonatal cerebral hemorrhage. Pregnant patients at risk for preterm birth are given IV magnesium sulfate to decrease incidence of CP. Categories include the following:

damage to the motor and accounts for 75% cases. result of damage to (uncontrollable jerking, and disappear during cerebellum. This type

Pyramidal (spastic): A result of damage to the motor cortex. This type presents with spastic paresis of any or all limbs and accounts for 75% of cases. Intellectual disabilities are also present in up to 90% of cases.

Extrapyramidal (dyskinetic): A result of damage to extrapyramidal tracts. Subtypes are choreoathetoid and dystonic (uncontrollable jerking, writhing, or posturing). Abnormal movements worsen with stress and disappear during sleep.

Ataxic: A result of damage to the cerebellum. This type of CP often presents with a lack of body coordination and hypotonia.

History/PE May be associated with seizure disorders, behavioral disorders, hearing or vision

impairment, learning disabilities, speech deficits, GI disorders, or other associated complications of prematurity.

Delayed achievement of gross motor and fine motor developmental milestones. Affected limbs may show hyperreflexia, pathologic reflexes (eg, Babinski), ↑ tone/contractures, weakness, and/or underdevelopment. Definite hand preference before 1 year of age is a red flag.

Toe walking and scissor gait common. Hip dislocations and scoliosis may be seen.
======================================
KEY FACT

The most common presenting symptom of cerebral palsy is delayed motor development.

Diagnosis Diagnosis is often clinical. Imaging can be used to determine the underlying cause of CP in some cases.

Ultrasonography may be useful in infants to identify intracranial hemorrhage or structural

malformations. MRI can be diagnostic. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be useful in patients with suspected seizures.

A full evaluation of hearing, vision, and developmental milestones (especially motor) should be done if there is suspicion of CP.

Treatment There is no cure for CP. Multidisciplinary treatment is required. Special education,

physical therapy, braces, and surgical release of contractures may help.

Spasticity can be treated with baclofen, diazepam, or dantrolene. Botulinum toxin can be helpful for localized spasticity. Baclofen pumps and posterior rhizotomy (nerve destruction for pain relief) may alleviate severe contractures.

FEBRILE SEIZURES

Usually occur in children between 6 months and 5 years of age who have no evidence of intracranial infection or other causes. Risk factors include a rapid ↑ in temperature and a history of febrile seizures in a close relative. Febrile seizures recur in approximately one in three patients.

History/PE Seizures usually occur during the onset of fever and may be the first sign of an underlying

illness (eg, otitis media, roseola). Classified as simple or complex:

Simple: A short (<15 minutes), generalized tonic-clonic seizure with one seizure in a 24-hour period and return to neurologic baseline shortly afterward. A high fever (>39°C [>102.2°F]) within hours of the seizure is typical.

Complex: A long (>15 minutes) seizure, focal seizure, or multiple seizures in a 24- hour period or no return to neurologic baseline. A low-grade fever for several days before seizure onset may be present.

Febrile status epilepticus: Prolonged continuous seizures (30 minutes) or intermittent seizures without return to baseline in between.
======================================
Diagnosis Often a clinical diagnosis, with exclusion of CNS abnormalities, inflammation, or

metabolic dysfunction that can account for the seizure.

Focus on finding source of infection. LP and CSF studies are indicated if there are concerns for clinical signs of CNS infection (eg, altered consciousness, meningismus, a tense/bulging anterior fontanelle) after ruling out ↑ ICP.

No workup necessary for first-time simple febrile seizures, and no laboratory studies needed if consistent with febrile seizures. Infants <6 months of age need a sepsis workup (CBC; urinalysis [UA]; and blood, urine, and CSF culture).

For atypical presentations, electrolytes, serum glucose, blood cultures, UA, and CBC with differential and additional studies as applicable to concerns.

KEY FACT

Only perform an LP if CNS infection is suspected in a patient with a febrile seizure. Keep in mind that if a patient is on antibiotics, it can mask symptoms of an infection.

Treatment First-time febrile seizures can be managed with observation and parental counseling. Seizures >5 minutes should be treated with anticonvulsant medications (eg,

benzodiazepines). Febrile status epilepticus can be treated with fosphenytoin.

Patient can be treated with antipyretics (acetaminophen; avoid ASA in light of the risk for Reye syndrome, acute liver failure, and encephalopathy), and any underlying illness should be addressed. Note that antipyretic therapy does not ↓ the recurrence of febrile seizures.

For complex seizures, the physician should conduct a thorough neurologic evaluation, including EEG and MRI. Chronic anticonvulsant therapy (eg, diazepam or phenobarbital) is only needed if abnormalities are found; usually not necessary.

Complications The risk for recurrence is about 30% to 35% and is highest within 1 year of the initial

INFANTILE HYPOTONIA

The lack of tone or resistance of muscle movement. It differs from weakness, which is the decrease in active muscle contraction. Common causes of infantile hypotonia are listed in Table 2.12-24.

======================================
SPINAL DYSRAPHISM

A type of neural tube defect (NTD) caused by improper closure of the neural tube, leading to a potentially exposed spine or spinal cord. An important risk factor is due to folate deficiency during pregnancy.

History/PE Patients have varying clinical presentations, depending on the type of spinal dysraphism. Closed spinal dysraphism includes:

Spina bifida occulta: Most common type. Caused by a defect in the vertebrae with intact meninges or spinal cord. Patients are usually asymptomatic with a tuft of hair or dimple at the level of the defect.

Open spinal dysraphism includes:

Meningocele: The meninges protrude through the vertebral defect. The spinal cord is often undamaged.

Myelomeningocele: This is the most severe variation. A portion of the spinal cord herniates through the vertebral defect.

Diagnosis Open spinal dysraphism is often detected by an elevated level of α-fetoprotein (AFP) in a quad screen during pregnancy. Ultrasound can then be used to rule out other causes of elevated AFP (eg, multifetal gestation).

Ultrasound can then be used treated with monitoring, severe and should be treated infection’.Long-term neuromuscular

Treatment Closed spinal dysraphism can be treated with monitoring, as patients are often asymptomatic. Open spinal dysraphism is more severe and should be treated with surgery within 3 days of birth to reduce any chances of infection. Long-term management includes multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams to optimize neuromuscular function.

BREATH-HOLDING SPELLS

Breath-holding spells are nonepileptic paroxysmal episodes that typically occur between 6 months and 6 years of age. The spells are brief periods when young children stop breathing for up to 1 minute. The spells can cause the child to lose consciousness and often occur when a young child is angry, frustrated, in pain, or afraid, but the spell is a reflex. There is a significant association between breath-holding spells and certain types of anemia, particularly iron-deficiency anemia. A family history of breath-holding spells is also present in a significant portion of patients.
======================================
KEY FACT

Breath-holding spells are triggered by an emotional trigger and may result in loss of consciousness or cyanosis. Although they may be alarming to the parents, these are benign episodes and not cardiac related. They typically resolve by 5 years of age.

History/PE Cyanotic variant: Most common. The episode is generally preceded by an upsetting event

such as a reprimand or temper tantrum. A stereotypical sequence ensues with a period of crying followed by forced apnea and loss of tone and consciousness. Cyanosis is very marked.

Pallid variant: More often in response to a very mild trauma to the head or upper body. The child then becomes pale and diaphoretic with loss of tone and consciousness.

Diagnosis The diagnosis is a clinical one. The episode must be distinguished from a seizure by careful history taking. A workup to identify anemia is recommended with hemoglobin and ferritin. The prognosis is excellent, with a complete resolution of spells in the vast majority of children by 8 years of age.

Treatment Treatment is limited to correcting an iron-deficiency anemia; correcting this can reduce the frequency of spells in some children. Antiepileptics are not recommended, and seizures generally resolve over time.

RETT SYNDROME

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is due to a mutation in the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome and is most commonly sporadic. It is almost exclusively seen in females, as males with the condition die almost immediately after birth. Manifestations begin around 6 to 18 months of age in girls.

die almost immediately typically begin after a period deceleration of head skills, fine motor skills,

History/PE Clinically, signs and symptoms typically begin after a period of normal growth and development. The earliest sign is the deceleration of head growth. Subsequently, patients will progressively lose communication skills, fine motor skills, and intellectual abilities. A distinctive feature of the condition is the development of stereotypical hand movements such as grasping of hair or clothing and episodes of inconsolable irritability.

Additional manifestations include the following:

Loss of spoken language Motor dysfunction Scoliosis Growth failure (head circumference first and then height and weight) Epilepsy Decreased bone mineral density Cardiac defects/autonomic dysfunction Sleep dysfunction Abnormal breathing during wakefulness

Diagnosis The clinical suspicion of Rett syndrome is confirmed by a DNA analysis showing mutations in the MECP2 gene.

Treatment

Treatment is largely supportive. Currently no disease-modifying treatments are routinely used. Patients are usually managed by a multidisciplinary team with physical, occupational, and communication therapy. Growth, nutrition, cardiac function, sleep, and neurologic function should be monitored.

CHIARI MALFORMATIONS

Congenital malformations are due to underdevelopment of the posterior fossa. There are two main types: Chiari I and Chiari II:

Chiari I: Herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum (I structure) (Fig. 2.12-21A). Typically presents after childhood with occipital headaches and cerebellar symptoms (ataxia, dizziness). Headaches are worse with Valsalva maneuver (eg, cough). Chiari I is associated with syringomyelia.

FIGURE 2.12-21. Chiari malformations. (A) outlines the herniation of the tonsils only (white arrows) in Chiari I. (B) outlines the herniation of the medulla (thin white arrow), tonsils (transparent white arrow), and vermis (thick white arrow) in Chiari II.

Chiari II: Herniation of cerebellar tonsils, vermis, and medulla through the foramen magnum (Fig. 2.12-21B). Presents at birth with apnea, stridor, dysphagia due to medullary compression, and noncommunicating hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis. Chiari II is associated with lumbosacral myelomeningocele, which can cause lower limb motor weakness/sensory loss.

BENIGN FAMILIAL MICROCEPHALY AND MACROCEPHALY

Microcephaly is defined as head circumference >2 standard deviations below the mean, whereas macrocephaly entails head circumference >2 standard deviations above the mean. Diagnosed in normal, healthy children with a normal parent with a similar-sized head. Development and examination will be normal with no syndromic features.

PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY
======================================
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA

A congenital form of pure red cell aplasia (causes isolated anemia versus Fanconi anemia, which causes pancytopenia; see Table 2.12-26). It is due to an intrinsic defect in erythroid progenitor cells, leading to macrocytic normochromic anemia. Patients have an increased malignancy risk (acute myelogenous leukemia [AML], myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS)], and solid tumors, eg, colon cancer). Other long-term complications include endocrine dysfunction (short stature, adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency) and hemosiderosis.

Treatment Corticosteroids (children ≥1 year old), RBC transfusions (infants <1 year old or steroid-

refractory patients), stem cell transplant (steroid-refractory patients)

Corticosteroids avoided in infants due to ↑ risk of adverse effects Monitoring for development of malignancies and iron overload, hemosiderosis (among

patients who received chronic transfusion therapy)
======================================
FANCONI ANEMIA

Autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder of chromosomal fragility. People of Ashkenazi Jewish descent ↑ carrier frequency. Genetic mutation of multiple DNA cross-link repair genes → impaired cellular repair of DNA cross-links → impaired cell cycle regulation, genomic instability → increased sensitivity to cytotoxic therapies and a predisposition for blood/solid malignancies (eg, AML, MDS, squamous cell cancers) and hematopoietic stem cell loss (→ bone marrow failure → macrocytic-normochromic anemia, pancytopenia). There are many other causes of bone marrow failure, which are described in Table 2.12-27.

History/PE Usually present within first 8 years of life. Pancytopenia: Neutropenia → life-threatening

infections; thrombocytopenia → bleeding risk, bruising, anemia → signs and symptoms of impaired oxygen-carrying capacity (eg, pallor, tachycardia, apnea, lethargy).

Associated with congenital abnormalities: Short stature, microcephaly, developmental delay, café au lait skin lesions, and malformations belonging to the VACTERL-H association. For an explanation of VACTERL-H, see the Mnemonic box.

Diagnosis CBC (↓ Hb, ↓ absolute neutrophil count, ↓ platelet count); ↓ absolute reticulocyte count Hypocellular bone marrow Specific testing: Chromosome breakage assay

Treatment Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (curative therapy for Fanconi

anemia–associated bone marrow failure, MDS, and leukemia).

Androgen therapy (eg, oxymetholone), growth factors (eg, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]), blood transfusion (leukoreduced, irradiated packed cell or platelet) therapy.

Screening, monitoring for malignancies. First-degree relatives of affected patient should be tested and provided genetic counseling.

CYCLIC NEUTROPENIA

Cyclic neutropenia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by consistent, symptomatic, and recurrent neutropenia (usually every 3 weeks). Associated with mutation of ELANE gene (encodes neutrophil elastase). Commonly affects children (equal sex predisposition). Cyclic neutropenia causes death, usually due to NEC, peritonitis, or sepsis. It is not associated with malignant transformation to MDS or AML.
======================================
THROMBOCYTOPENIA ABSENT RADIUS SYNDROME

Thrombocytopenia absent radius (TAR) syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by a deletion and/or mutation in the RBM8A gene. Characterized by hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and bilateral radial bone aplasia in the presence of thumbs (usually absent or hypoplastic in Fanconi anemia). TAR can be precipitated by stress, infection, or allergy to cow’s milk. Intracranial hemorrhage results in increased mortality.

History/PE Presents with frequent nosebleeds or GI bleeding, bruising, life-threatening hemorrhages (due to thrombocytopenia), and radial aplasia. Ninety percent of individuals present with symptomatic thrombocytopenia by age 4 months, but patients improve with age. Frequent cow’s milk allergy (→ vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and failure to thrive). Associated with cardiac defects (ASD, VSD, TOF), facial defects (micrognathia; tall,

vomiting, bloody (ASD, VSD, TOF); facial and lower extremity present:t-eosinophil count

broad forehead, hypertelorism), and lower extremity defects (hip dislocation, femoral and tibial torsion).

Diagnosis CBC: Thrombocytopenia is present. ↑ eosinophil count may be found (50% of cases). ↑

WBC or ↓ Hb may also be found.

X-ray of the forearm: Imaging shows characteristic absent radii and presence of thumbs. Bone marrow biopsy: This is not required for diagnosis but can help exclude other

differentials.

Molecular testing: Deletion or duplication analysis of RBM8A gene can confirm diagnosis.

======================================
KASABACH-MERRITT SYNDROME

A life-threatening coagulopathy of infancy classically characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and consumptive coagulopathy. Occurs as a complication of a rapidly growing vascular tumor (kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma). Intravascular coagulation with platelet trapping → thrombocytopenia, fibrinogen consumption and degradation, consumption of coagulation factors → disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). These benign vascular tumors are aggressive. Complications

include reactive hemarthrosis (→ hemophilia-like arthropathy), congestive cardiac failure, and GI bleeding. Kasabach-Merritt syndrome has a high mortality rate due to life-threatening bleeding, cardiac failure, and/or local invasion into structures.

History/PE Kasabach-Merritt syndrome presents in infancy with an enlarging, firm, purpuric

cutaneous or soft tissue lesion, as shown in Figure 2.12-22. Most commonly in the trunk, extremities, or retroperitoneum. It may be associated with overlying hypertrichosis or hyperhidrosis.

film (PBF) in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

Prolonged PT, aPTT, ↓ fibrinogen, ↑ D-dimer, ↑ fibrin degradation products ([FDPs] in severe DIC)

Ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI of suspected tumor can be performed to assess extent of the visible lesion or to evaluate visceral lesions. Tumor biopsy is contraindicated due to bleeding risk.

Treatment Definitive treatment is surgical resection of the tumor. If the tumor is not amenable to surgery, various other modalities with varying efficacy are

available: systemic corticosteroids, radiation therapy, pneumatic compression, embolization and/or pharmacotherapy (eg, α-interferon, platelet aggregation inhibitors, chemotherapy, particularly vincristine).
======================================
SICKLE CELL DISEASE

An autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation of adult hemoglobin (the β-chain has Glu replaced by Val, causing production of an abnormal β globin chain), resulting in the production of HbS rather than HbA. HbA2 and HbF are still produced. It is common in patients of sub-Saharan African descent. The homozygote (SS) has sickle cell anemia (HbSS), and the heterozygote (HbAS) has sickle cell trait, which causes no disability (it does uniquely protect against Plasmodium falciparum malaria). Signs and symptoms of sickle cell

disease are caused by ↓ RBC survival and a tendency of sickled cells to aggregate and cause vaso-occlusion.

KEY FACT

Sickling occurs with dehydration and deoxygenation and at high altitude. As it happens in the vasa recta (vessels supplying the inner medulla of the kidneys), sickle cell patients have ↓ ability to concentrate urine, presenting as polyuria or nocturia.

History/PE Classic presentation of pain crisis: Patient of sub-Saharan African descent with sudden onset of severe chest pain, back pain, or thigh pain. Pain may be accompanied by fever.

Acute chest syndrome: Pulmonary infiltrations involving complete lung segments and causing chest pain, fever, wheezing, coughing, and tachypnea. Chief causes of infiltration are fat embolism from bone marrow or infection with S pneumoniae, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, or viruses.

May first present with dactylitis in childhood (bilateral hand/foot swelling). Lifelong hemolysis results in anemia, jaundice, pigmented cholelithiasis, ↑ cardiac output

([CO] murmur, eventual CHF), and delayed growth.

Chronic hemolysis is usually well tolerated, except in an acute, painful vaso-occlusive crisis ([VOC], commonly caused by microvascular occlusion), which stems from infection/fever, hypoxia, dehydration, and cold temperatures.

Leads to ischemic organ damage, especially splenic infarction (typically occurs <2 years of age), which predisposes to infection from encapsulated organisms, particularly pneumococcal sepsis and acute chest syndrome (pneumonia and/or pulmonary infarction; see Fig. 2.12-23). Patient is also susceptible to osteomyelitis and to chronic kidney disease (sickle cell nephropathy).

Other complications: Splenic sequestration (sudden pooling of blood into the spleen

resulting in hypovolemia) and aplastic crisis (secondary to infection with viruses such as parvovirus B19). Both complications present with ↓ hematocrit but are distinguished clinically by ↓ reticulocytes in aplastic crisis (secondary to bone marrow involvement) and ↑ reticulocytes in splenic sequestration.

Sickle cell trait (HbAS) is relatively benign. Patients have normal Hb and RBC morphology. However, renal complications include hematuria (renal papillary necrosis), defect in the ability to concentrate urine (hyposthenuria), and ↑ risk for UTIs.
======================================
KEY FACT

The most common cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease is Staphylococcus aureus; Salmonella is the second most common cause. Patients are also at ↑ risk for avascular necrosis of the femoral head.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CBC (↑ reticulocytes, ↑ indirect bilirubin) with peripheral smear showing

sickle cells and Howell-Jolly bodies (see Fig. 2.12-24)

FIGURE 2.12-24. Sickle cell disease. (A) Sickle-shaped RBCs (arrow) are almost always seen on blood smear, regardless of whether the patient is having a sickle cell crisis.

MNEMONIC

Causes/triggers of acute VOC in sickle cell disease— HIDe in the COLD Hypoxia Infections/fever Dehydration COLD temperatures

Treatment

Management of chronic disease:

Treat with hydroxyurea, which stimulates the production of fetal hemoglobin and helps prevent the recurrence of sickle cell crises. Hydroxyurea is teratogenic and may cause mild myelosuppression (important to monitor WBCs).

If hydroxyurea does not prove effective, chronic transfusion therapy, which carries the risk for iron overload, can be attempted.

Folic acid supplementation is often required to prevent macrocytic anemia caused by frequent RBC turnover.

The risk exists for septicemia in febrile patients or in leukocytosis. Have low threshold to give antibiotics (use ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin).

Patients with autosplenectomy benefit from prophylactic pneumococcal vaccination and antibiotics (penicillin in patients <5 years of age) since they are at ↑ risk for infection from encapsulated bacteria. Treat recurrent cholelithiasis with cholecystectomy.

Management of sickle cell crises:

Patients with VOC require pain to be treated with adequate analgesia (pain management), O2 therapy, IV fluid rehydration, and antibiotics (if infection is suspected to be the trigger).

If there is concern of a VOC progressing to acute chest syndrome, initiate aggressive hydration, antibiotics, and incentive spirometry. Keep the sickle variant <40%. This can be done with simple transfusions or, if necessary, exchange transfusion in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Bronchodilators may be helpful.

PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY

LEUKEMIA

A hematopoietic malignancy of lymphocytic or myeloblastic origin. The most common childhood malignancy; 97% of cases are acute leukemias (acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL] > AML). ALL is most common in non-Hispanic White males between 2 and 5 years of age, whereas AML is seen most frequently in Black boys throughout childhood. Associated with trisomy 21, Fanconi anemia, prior radiation, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and congenital bone marrow failure states, ALL in children has a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate >85%.

KEY FACT

ALL is the most common childhood malignancy, followed by CNS tumors and lymphomas.

History/PE Symptoms are abrupt in onset. They are initially nonspecific (anorexia, fatigue) and are

accompanied by bone pain with a limp or refusal to bear weight and fever (from neutropenia).

CNS metastases may be associated with headache, vomiting, and papilledema. AML can present with a chloroma, a greenish soft tissue tumor of leukemic cells on the

skin or spinal cord.

Diagnosis Physical examination: Ecchymoses, petechiae (thrombocytopenia), pallor (anemia), and/or

hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy may be present.

Laboratory studies: CBC (pancytopenia), coagulation studies, and peripheral blood smear are included. The blood work frequently shows high numbers of blasts (lymphoblasts [ALL] or myeloblasts [AML] are found in 90% of cases). WBC counts can be low, normal, or high.

A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for immunophenotyping (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT] assay and a panel of monoclonal antibodies to T- and B-cell antigens) and genetic analysis are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the risk status to inform treatment. The diagnosis is made if bone marrow is hypercellular with ↑ lymphoblasts.

A CXR can rule out a mediastinal mass (usually thymus).

Treatment Chemotherapy based, including induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases.

Intrathecal chemotherapy for neurologic prophylaxis is generally added to the treatment regimen.

Tumor lysis syndrome is common during the initiation of treatment of cancers with high cell turnover (such as leukemias and lymphomas).

Caused by the lysis of many neoplastic cells in a short period, resulting in the release of cell contents into the bloodstream.

Characterized by hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia (as calcium is bound by phosphate released from the neoplastic cells). It can result in renal failure, arrhythmias, and death.

Treatment with fluids, diuretics, and rasburicase (which reduces the risk for urate- induced nephropathy). Allopurinol can be used as a preventive therapy, but rasburicase has been shown to be more effective in treatment. Corticosteroids may precipitate tumor lysis syndrome.

NEUROBLASTOMA

An embryonal tumor of neural crest origin, similar to pheochromocytoma. More than one half of patients are <2 years of age, and 70% have distant metastases at presentation. Neuroblastomas are associated with neurofibromatosis, Hirschsprung disease, Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome, and the N-myc oncogene.

History/PE Tumors can be located anywhere along the sympathetic chain, but are most commonly abdominal (in the adrenal medulla, followed by the paraspinal region), thoracic, and cervical (in descending order).

Symptoms may vary with location and may include abdominal distention with a firm and

irregular abdominal mass (may cross the midline), Horner syndrome, hypertension, opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (“dancing eyes–dancing feet syndrome”), or cord compression (from a paraspinal tumor). Patients may have anemia, FTT, and fever. More than 50% of patients will have metastases at diagnosis. Signs include bone marrow suppression, proptosis, hepatomegaly, subcutaneous nodules, and opsoclonus/myoclonus.

most common solid tumor of childhood and is derived from neural crest cells. Unlike Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), neuroblastoma is accompanied by systemic symptoms and often crosses the midline. The majority of children have metastases at the time of diagnosis.

History/PE Affects axial and proximal muscles more than distal muscles May present with progressive clumsiness, fatigability, difficulty standing or walking,

fibrotic tissue.

Immunostaining is ⊖ and CK is ↑. Electromyography (EMG) shows polyphasic potentials and ↑ recruitment. Screening with ECG and echocardiogram can detect dilated cardiomyopathy or conduction

abnormalities.

Treatment Glucocorticoids and physical therapy are necessary to maintain ambulation and to prevent contractures. Liberal use of tendon release surgery may prolong ambulation.

Complications Death occurs by 20 to 30 years of age due to dilated cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure or respiratory failure.

KEY FACT

A child with a neck mass and head tilt to one side likely has congenital torticollis, caused by fibrosis or spasm of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. First-line treatment involves physical therapy and improved positioning. Plagiocephaly may result if left untreated or if child does not have adequate “tummy time.”

Autosomal dominant disorder causing impaired muscle relaxation (look for “abnormally long handshake” on USMLE). Onset later in life compared to DMD and BMD. Symptoms include difficulty relaxing muscles (myotonia), dysphagia, balding, testicular atrophy, cataracts, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Type 1 is caused by trinucleotide repeat disorder (CTG) on the DMPK gene (Cataracts, Toupee, Gonads).

SPONDYLOLISTHESIS

Forward slipping of vertebrae (L5 over S1) due to hyperextension of the spine, common in children and adolescents (eg, gymnasts, weightlifters). Presents with bowel and bladder symptoms, lower back pain, and a palpable “step-off” on PE. Associated with congenital malformation of the lumbosacral joints and spondylolysis (pars interarticularis defects).

joints and spondylolysis extremity, where the indicated, and the resolution.

METATARSUS ADDUCTUS

Congenital deformity of the lower extremity, where the forefoot is turned inward. If the foot is flexible, no surgical treatment is indicated, and the condition is treated with physical therapy and support for spontaneous resolution.

CLUBFOOT (TALIPES EQUINOVARUS)

Congenital deformity of the lower extremity, presenting with forefoot adduction and varus of the calcaneum, talus, and midfoot. In contrast to metatarsus adductus, the foot is not flexible and requires immediate treatment with serial casting. Surgical correction within 3 to 6 months if it does not resolve.
======================================
DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP

Also called congenital hip dislocation. Excessive hip flexion in utero (eg, breech presentation) leads to excessive stretching of the posterior hip capsule, causing lax musculature and contractures. Developmental dysplasia of the hip can result in subluxation or dislocation of femoral heads and acetabular dysplasia, leading to early degenerative joint disease.

History/PE Most commonly found in firstborn girls born in the breech position. ↑ risk occurs with

family history.

Barlow maneuver: Posterior pressure is placed on the flexed hip, and then the hip is adducted, leading to an audible “clunk” as the femoral head dislocates posteriorly.

Ortolani maneuver: Thighs are gently abducted from the midline with anterior pressure on the greater trochanter. A soft click signifies a reduction of the femoral head into the acetabulum.

Allis (Galeazzi) sign: The knees are at unequal heights when the hips and knees are flexed in the supine position (the dislocated side is lower).

Asymmetric inguinal skinfolds that extend beyond the anus and limited abduction of the affected hip are also seen.

If not treated in infancy, older children present with hip pain and leg length discrepancy, causing a waddling or Trendelenburg gait.

Figure 2.12-26 outlines the clinical tests and asymmetric skinfolds.

FIGURE 2.12-26. Developmental dysplasia of the hip. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Diagnosis Early detection with PE is critical to allow for proper hip development. Performing ultrasonography before 4 months of age is recommended, given lack of

ossification of the femoral head.

X-rays are appropriate at >4 months of age.

Treatment Treatment should begin early even though the condition may resolve on its own before 2 weeks of age.

<6 months: Rigid brace, splint with a Pavlik harness (maintains the hip as flexed and abducted); to prevent AVN, the hips should not be flexed >60 degrees

6 to 18 months: Spica cast >18 months: Open reduction followed by spica cast

Complications Joint contractures and AVN of the femoral head Without treatment, significant disability
======================================
LEGG-CALVÉ-PERTHES DISEASE

Idiopathic AVN and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (see Fig. 2.12-27). Most common in boys 4 to 10 years of age. Can be a self-limited disease in younger patients, with symptoms lasting <18 months.

FIGURE 2.12-27. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head showing fragmentation with loss of spherical contour. (Reproduced with permission from Skinner HB. Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Orthopedics, 2nd ed. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange; 2000.)

History/PE Generally asymptomatic at first. Patients can develop a painless limp, antalgic gait, and

thigh muscle atrophy.

Pain sometimes present. If it is present, it can be in the groin or anterior thigh, or it may be referred to the knee.

»

»

Limited abduction and internal rotation; atrophy of the affected leg. Usually unilateral (85%–90%).

Diagnosis

Initial x-rays can be normal but later can show a flattened and fragmented femoral head.

Treatment Observation is sufficient if limited femoral head involvement or if full range of motion

(ROM) is present.

If extensive necrosis or ↓ ROM, the physician can consider bracing, hip abduction with a Petrie cast, or an osteotomy.

The prognosis is favorable if the patient is <6 years of age and has full ROM, ↓ femoral head involvement, and a stable joint.

KEY FACT

Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease typically presents as painLESS, whereas slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) can be painFULL.

SLIPPED CAPITAL FEMORAL EPIPHYSIS

Poor endochondral ossification of the growth plate during a growth spurt and increased shear force cause displacement of the femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck, through the growth plate. The name slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is misleading because the epiphysis remains within the acetabulum while the metaphysis moves anteriorly and superiorly. Presents in obese children 10 to 16 years of age; most common hip disorder in adolescence. Associated with trauma, hypothyroidism, and other endocrinopathies.

Treatment The disease is progressive, so treatment should begin promptly. Immediate surgical screw fixation can reduce the risk for AVN. No weight-bearing should be allowed until the defect is surgically stabilized.

Complications Chondrolysis, AVN of the femoral head, and premature hip osteoarthritis requiring arthroplasty.

SCOLIOSIS

A lateral curvature of the spine >10 degrees (Cobb angle). It is sometimes associated with kyphosis or lordosis. Most commonly idiopathic. Develops in early adolescence. Other etiologies are congenital or associated with neuromuscular, vertebral, or spinal cord disease. The male-to-female ratio is 1:7 for curves that progress and require treatment.

History/PE Idiopathic disease is usually identified during school physical screening. Vertebral and rib rotation deformities are accentuated by the Adams forward bending test.

Diagnosis X-rays of the spine (posterior, anterior, and full-length views).

Treatment Monitoring every 6 months for 10 to 30 degrees of curvature. Spinal bracing for ≥30 degrees of curvature in patients with remaining growth. Curvature

may progress even with bracing.

Surgical correction for ≥40 to 50 degrees of curvature.

Complications Severe scoliosis can create restrictive lung disease.
======================================
CHILD ABUSE

Also known as nonaccidental trauma (NAT); includes neglect and physical, sexual, and psychological maltreatment of children. The physician should suspect abuse if the history is discordant with physical findings or if there is a delay in obtaining appropriate medical care. Certain injuries in children, such as retinal hemorrhages and specific fracture types, are highly suspicious for abuse.

KEY FACT

Suspect sexual abuse if there is genital trauma, bleeding, discharge, or if children have an excessive preoccupation with or knowledge of adult sexual behavior. Vaginal foreign body may be an alternative diagnosis.

history is not consistent example; if parents (developmentally,.2-month-olds changes or is (indicative of the object circumscribed.

History/PE Abuse should be suspected if the history is not consistent with the injury pattern or with the child’s developmental age—for example, if parents claim their 2-month-old child “rolled off the couch” (developmentally, 2-month-olds cannot roll yet). Abuse also should be suspected if the history continually changes or is vague.

Look for skin bruising patterns (indicative of the object used), bruises of different ages and color, and burns that are well circumscribed.

Injuries with high specificity for child abuse include posterior rib fractures, metaphyseal corner “bucket handle” fractures, and spiral fractures of long bones such as the femur (but only before the child can walk, as a spiral fracture may be developmentally appropriate in a walking child).

Risk factors: These include parents with a history of abuse as a child, partner violence, and/or a history of alcohol or drug use; premature children; children with complex medical problems; infants with colic (excessive crying for >3 hours per day for >3 days per week); and repeated hospitalizations

Infants: Abuse or neglect in infants may present as apnea, seizures, feeding intolerance, excessive irritability, somnolence, or FTT.

Older children: Neglect in older children may present as poor hygiene or behavioral abnormalities.

See Table 2.12-31 for exam findings.

great mimicker of child collagen:Those with OI blue sclera, easy easily fractured bones.

KEY FACT

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a great mimicker of child abuse and is often tested. It is a genetic disease that affects type I collagen. Those with OI can present with a broad spectrum of clinical features—most classically blue sclera, easy bruising, opalescent teeth, conductive hearing loss, skeletal anomalies, and easily fractured bones.

KEY FACT

In infants, Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated on a vaginal culture is definitive evidence of sexual abuse. Chlamydia is not, because it can be acquired from the mother during delivery and can persist for up to 3 years.

Diagnosis An x-ray skeletal survey can show fractures in various stages of healing. X-rays may not show fractures until 1 to 2 weeks after injury (although they may show evidence of prior trauma in children <3 years of age). Radionucleotide bone scans (bone scintigraphy) are sometimes used, as they are more sensitive and may show fractures before they are detectable on x-rays; however, they are less specific than plain films.

If sexual abuse is suspected, the physician should request tests for gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, HIV, and sperm (within 72 hours of assault).

Abusive head trauma (formerly referred to as shaken baby syndrome) can be ruled out by

an ophthalmologic exam for retinal hemorrhages and a noncontrast CT for subdural hematoma. Infants with abusive head trauma often do not exhibit external signs of abuse. An MRI can visualize white-matter changes associated with violent shaking and the extent

of intracranial and extracranial bleeds.

Treatment Document and photograph findings, including location; size; shape; color; and the nature

of all lesions, bruises, or burns.

Notify child protective services for evaluation of safety of the child in their current home. Hospitalize if necessary to stabilize injuries or to protect the child. Administer antibiotics and high-dose oral contraceptives for victims of sexual abuse.
======================================
WELL-CHILD CARE

ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE

An important aspect of every well-child visit. Commonly discussed advice includes the following:

Keep the water heater at <48.8°C (<120°F). Babies should sleep on their backs without any stuffed animals, toys, or bottles in the crib

(to ↓ the risk for sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS]).

Car safety seats should be rear facing and should be placed in the back of the car (seats can face forward if the child is >2 years of age and weighs >18 kg [>40 lb]).

and should be years of age and weighs before 6 months-of age; a time. Do not give anemia). longer routinely immediately for mention in a well-child visit

No solid foods should be given before 6 months of age; solid foods should then be introduced gradually and one at a time. Do not give cow’s milk before 12 months of age (increases risk of iron-deficiency anemia).

Syrup of ipecac (an emetic) is no longer routinely recommended for accidental poisoning. Poison control should be contacted immediately for assistance.

Other guidance important to mention in a well-child visit includes the following:

Children should wear helmets when riding bicycles. Parents should ensure that firearms are not loaded and are locked away. Smoke detectors should be present and in working order. Intake of sugar-sweetened drinks and juices is strongly discouraged; juice should be

avoided before 12 months of age.

Safe sex education should be provided for adolescents. Screen time should be limited for children, as hands-on learning is essential for

children younger than 24 months.

KEY FACT

SIDS: Sudden infant death syndrome. Most common cause of unexplained death in children <1 year of age. Unknown pathogenesis.

BRUE: Brief resolved unexplained event. <1 minute in duration with no known cause. May present with an abrupt change in respiration, ↓ responsiveness, cyanosis, and change in muscle tone. No longer thought to be a precursor of SIDS.

A mother presents with her previously healthy 3-month-old infant boy, stating that he has been increasingly difficult to rouse for the past 4 hours and has lost interest in feeding; she left the baby alone with her boyfriend while she ran errands. While en route to the hospital, the baby stopped breathing. PE is notable for occipital bruising. What is the most likely cause of this child’s apnea?
======================================
HEARING AND VISION SCREENING

Objective hearing screening (otoacoustic emissions and/or auditory brainstem response) for newborns before discharge is a standard of care. Children who fail these screening tests require further diagnostic workup.

Objective hearing screening is indicated for children with a history of meningitis, TORCH infections, measles and mumps, and recurrent otitis media. The most common cause of childhood conductive hearing loss is repeated ear infections.

The red reflex should be checked at birth. Leukocoria is the lack of a red reflex and can indicate the presence of retinoblastoma. It can also be an incidental finding in a baby’s first photos.

Vision screening to detect strabismus (ocular misalignment), amblyopia (suppression of retinal images in a misaligned eye, leading to permanent vision loss), and other conditions should be performed at all health visits in children <5 years of age.

of age; beyond;3. ophthalmologist and may require Treatment.of strengthen the muscles

Strabismus is normal until 3 months of age; beyond 3 months of age, children should be evaluated by a pediatric ophthalmologist and may require corrective lenses, occlusion, and/or surgery to prevent amblyopia. Treatment of strabismus includes occluding the normal eye with an eye patch to strengthen the muscles and use of the abnormal eye.

KEY FACT

Leukocoria indicates retinoblastoma, congenital cataracts, or retinopathy of prematurity. All cases of leukocoria require immediate ophthalmologic workup.

CHILDHOOD VACCINATIONS

The Epidemiology chapter summarizes Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)– recommended vaccinations for the pediatric population. Contraindications and precautions in this population are as follows.

Contraindications:

Severe allergy to a vaccine component or a prior dose of vaccine. Patients who have life- threatening allergies to eggs may receive measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and influenza vaccinations under observation. The physician should exercise caution in administering yellow fever vaccinations to those with egg allergies.

Encephalopathy within 7 days of prior pertussis vaccination. Personal history of intussusception and SCID contraindications for the rotavirus vaccine. Live vaccines (rotavirus, oral polio vaccine, varicella, MMR, intranasal influenza, yellow

fever) to be avoided in immunocompromised and pregnant patients (exception: HIV patients with CD4+ cell count >200 copies/mm3 may receive MMR and varicella).
======================================
Precautions:

Current moderate to severe illness (with or without fever) Prior reactions to pertussis vaccine (fever >40.5°C [>104.9°F]), a shocklike state,

persistent crying for >3 hours within 48 hours of vaccination, or seizure within 3 days of vaccination

History of receiving IVIG in the past year

The following are not contraindications to vaccination:

Mild illness and/or low-grade fever Current antibiotic therapy Prematurity—all vaccines should be given, based on the child’s chronologic age, even if

the child is premature

The most likely cause of this infant’s apnea is abusive head trauma, which is most common in 3- to 4-month-old infants and presents early with nonspecific symptoms (lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting) and later with seizures or apnea. There is generally no reported history of head trauma. Subdural hematoma and edema account for most neurologic findings. In babies with abusive head trauma, there is a 50%–70% chance of prior abuse.

abusive head trauma, by-lead-contaminated performed at 12 and 24

LEAD POISONING

Most exposure in children is caused by lead-contaminated household dust from lead paint. Screening should be routinely performed at 12 and 24 months of age for patients living in high-risk areas (pre-1970s homes or zip codes with high percentages of elevated blood lead levels). Universal screening is not recommended.

History/PE Children are usually asymptomatic. Children <6 years are most susceptible to the effects

of lead because of an immature blood-brain barrier.

Common symptoms include peripheral neuropathy (wrist and foot drop), cognitive impairment, colicky abdominal pain, constipation, headache, hyperactivity or apathy, and anorexia.

Acute encephalopathy (usually with levels >70 μg/dL) is characterized by ↑ ICP, vomiting, confusion, seizures, and coma.

KEY FACT

New evidence has shown impaired intelligence and neurodevelopmental outcomes among children exposed to lead levels as low as 10 µg/dL.

Diagnosis The physician should do a fingerstick test as an initial screen at 1 or 2 years of age; if

elevated, then a serum venous blood lead level should be obtained.

CBC and peripheral blood smear show microcytic, hypochromic anemia and basophilic stippling (see Fig. 2.12-29). Sideroblastic anemia may also be present. Note that concurrent iron-deficiency anemia may also be present, as both lead poisoning and iron deficiency share similar risk factors.

Classically due to skin breakdown by petrolatum) exposure to urine or stool. Candida diaper dermatitis Second most common in infants. Presents as beefy red, confluent Topical antifungal (eg, nystatin) plaques with satellite lesions. Does not spare the skinfolds. Perianal streptococcus Occurs in school-aged children in addition to infants. Presents Oral B-lactam antibiotics as a red, sharply demarcated perianal rash with associated pruritis and pain. May have blood-streaked stools or constipa- tion from withholding stool due to pain. Diagnosis can be confirmed with perianal bacterial culture.

PIGMENTED LESIONS IN CHILDHOOD

The commonly tested lesions are listed in Table 2.12-33.

TABLE 2.12-33. Pigmented Lesions in Childhood

LESION DESCRIPTION Congenital melanocytic nevus Benign proliferation of melanocytes with an increased density of hair follicles. They present as solitary hyperpigmented lesions with coarse hair (Image A). The melanocytes may enlarge during infancy; large lesions are often surgically removed due to increased risk of transformation to melanoma. Congenital dermal melanocytosis Multiple poorly circumscribed, nontender, flat, blue-gray patches that do not blanch (Image 8). They are (CDM) (Mongolian spot) often located on the lower back and sacral region and fade spontaneously during childhood. More common in people of Asian and Black descent. Congenital dermal melanocytosis may be mistaken for bruises due to abuse; however, bruises are tender, show color variation, and fade quickly. Presence of CDM should be documented on initial evaluation. Café au lait spots Flat, hyperpigmented patches having “coffee with milk” appearance (Image C). Isolated spots are most often idiopathic/benign, but multiple spots may be associated with McCune-Albright syndrome and neurofibromatosis. 1B Image A reproduced with permission from Kinsler VA, O'Hare P, Jacques T, Hargrave D, Slater O.

CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT DISORDERS

ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER

A persistent pattern of excessive inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Typically presents between 3 and 13 years of age; more common in males; often shows a familial relationship

History/PE Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) presents with core symptoms that can be divided into the following two categories:

Inattention: Exhibits a poor/short attention span in schoolwork/play; displays poor attention to detail or careless mistakes; has difficulty following instructions or finishing tasks; is forgetful and easily distracted

Hyperactivity/impulsivity: Fidgets; leaves seat in classroom; runs around inappropriately; cannot play quietly; talks excessively; does not wait for their turn; interrupts others

Diagnosis Symptoms must be present and cause an impairment in functioning for ≥6 months in at

least two independent settings (eg, home and school).

Age <17 years: Diagnosis requires six or more symptoms from either category of core

symptoms (inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity)

Age ≥17 years: Diagnosis requires five or more symptoms from either category of core symptoms

Symptoms must be present before 12 years of age Alternative causes of inattention and/or hyperactivity must be considered (such as

substance abuse, organic reasons [eg, lead toxicity], hearing/visual impairment, thyroid disorders, sleep disorders, absence seizures)
======================================
Treatment Four to five years of age:

Best initial treatment: Behavior therapy. The physician can add medication if behaviors do not improve.

Six years of age or older:

Best initial treatment: Pharmacologic therapy + behavior therapy First line: Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (eg, methylphenidate,

dextroamphetamine, amphetamine salts [dextroamphetamine and amphetamine combo])

Adverse effects: Weight loss (↓ appetite), insomnia, anxiety, irritability, headache, tic exacerbation, and ↓ growth velocity (normalizes when medication is stopped)

for causing weight loss, for individuals with guardian is against

Because of stimulants’ potential for causing weight loss, it is recommended to give them after meals

KEY FACT

Use of stimulants is contraindicated for individuals with illicit substance abuse at risk for addiction and those whose parent/legal guardian is against their use.

Alternatives: Nonstimulants

Atomoxetine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; second-line treatment): Can be tried first because of the negative side-effect profile of CNS stimulants

Third-line treatments: clonidine/guanfacine (α2-agonist), bupropion, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

All ages: Continuation of regular diet. Sugar and food additives are not considered etiologic factors.

KEY FACT

Children must exhibit ADHD symptoms in two or more settings (eg, home and school).
======================================
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER

Developmental disorder characterized by impairments in two major domains: (1) social interaction and communication and (2) repetitive/restricted behavior, interests, or activities. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is more common in males. Severity is based on the level of support required for each domain. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

Disorders (DSM)-5 does not distinguish among the pervasive developmental disorders.

History/PE Deficits in social interaction and communication: Reduced interest in socialization, reduced empathy, inability to form relationships, impaired language development, inability to understand social cues, poor eye contact

Prognosis is best determined by language development because its development is based on social interaction

Restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities: Highly fixated or restricted interests, inflexibility to change, hand flapping or other stereotypies, increased/decreased response to sensory input (eg, indifference to temperature, excessive touching/smelling, adverse responses to sounds)

Symptoms must impair function (eg, academic, social) Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (typically <3 years of age) Conditions that produce symptoms suggestive of ASD must be excluded:

Intellectual disability or global developmental delay Hearing impairment: Ruled out with audiometry before making diagnosis Selective mutism: Refusal to speak only in social situations Rett syndrome: Similar to ASD; X-linked disorder characterized by marked physical

and psychomotor regression at approximately 6 months of age after normal development. Predominantly seen in females; patients have classic hand-wringing movements

seen in females; patients dominant disorder inherited intellectual macro-orchidism, long everted‘ears, autism,

Fragile X syndrome: X-linked dominant disorder caused by hypermethylation of FMR1 gene; most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism; presents with the following characteristics: macro-orchidism, long face, prominent jaw and forehead, high arched palate, large and everted ears, autism, connective tissue laxity, and /or mitral valve prolapse

Treatment Intensive special education, behavioral management (specifically applied behavior

analysis therapy), and symptom-targeted medications (eg, stimulants or α2-agonists for ADHD; neuroleptics for aggression and mood instability; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] for stereotypical behavior, anxiety, and mood) Family support and counseling—crucial components of treatment
======================================
KEY FACT

In patients with ASD, think about associated congenital conditions, such as Rett syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and fragile X syndrome.

DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS

Includes conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). More common in males and in patients with a history of abuse. Psychiatric comorbidities are common (eg, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, substance abuse, somatoform conditions, personality disorders).

History/PE ODD: A pattern of negative, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures (eg, losing temper, arguing) for ≥6 months. May progress to conduct disorder.

Conduct disorder: A repetitive, persistent pattern of violating the basic rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms/rules for ≥1 year in children <18 years of age. Behaviors can be aggressive (eg, rape, robbery, animal cruelty) or nonaggressive (eg, destruction of property, stealing, lying, running away, and truancy). After 18 years of age, conduct disorder is considered antisocial personality disorder.

DMDD: A pattern of severe, recurrent verbal (eg, screaming) or behavioral (eg, physical aggression) outbursts that are out of proportion to the situation and a persistently irritable or angry mood between outbursts.

Symptoms must occur for ≥1 year; they may progress to depression in adulthood. DMDD should not be diagnosed before 6 years of age or after 18 years of age.

Treatment Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for all disruptive behavioral disorders.

KEY FACT

Conduct disorder is diagnosed in Children. Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed in Adults.

DEVELOPMENTAL practical functioning. infections, teratogens

INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER/INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY

Disorder of cognitive, social, and practical functioning. Associated with male sex, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital infections, teratogens (including alcohol/illicit substances), and inborn errors of metabolism. Most often no identifiable cause is found in most patients with intellectual disability.

History/PE Patients have deficiencies in multiple domains as follows:

Intellectual deficits: Poor reasoning, problem solving, planning, and performance on standardized testing

Adaptive functioning deficits: Poor hygiene, social functioning, activities of daily living (ADLs)

Onset: During developmental period (<18 years of age) Severity of intellectual disability: Determined by level of support required to address

Severity of intellectual disability: Determined by level of support required to address impaired adaptive functioning (IQ cutoffs for severity are no longer used with the DSM-5)

impaired adaptive functioning (IQ cutoffs for severity are no longer used with the DSM-5) Mild (independent in ADLs); moderate (some teaching and support for ADLs); severe

(significant support for ADLs); profound (dependent on support for all ADLs)

Differential diagnosis: Specific learning disorder (reading, math, or writing skills that are significantly lower than expected for age and intelligence)

Reading disorder is the most common

Treatment Primary prevention: Educating the public about possible causes of intellectual disability

and providing optimal prenatal screening and care to pregnant patients

Treatment measures: Family counseling and support, speech and language therapy, occupational/physical therapy, behavioral intervention, educational assistance, and social skills training

Learning disorder: Remedial therapy directed toward patient’s deficiency
======================================
KEY FACT

Down syndrome (trisomy 21): The most common chromosomal cause of intellectual disability

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS): The most common preventable cause of intellectual disability

Fragile X syndrome: The most common inherited form of intellectual disability

TOURETTE SYNDROME

Disorder characterized by both motor and vocal tics. More common in males; shows a genetic predisposition. Associated with ADHD, learning disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Symptoms can be temporarily suppressed with effort or exacerbated by stress and fatigue.

History/PE Symptoms begin <18 years of age and cause social or occupational impairment.

Diagnosis Diagnosis requires the following:

Multiple motor tics (eg, blinking, grimacing) One or more vocal tics (eg, grunting, coprolalia, echolalia, throat clearing, coughing) Tics present for >1 year Tics recurrent (occur many times per day and/or nearly every day)

Treatment Best initial treatment: Behavior therapy; habit reversal therapy is most effective. If behavior therapy fails or tics are severe/disabling, the next step is pharmacologic management.

Antidopaminergic agents:

Dopamine-depleting agents (eg, tetrabenazine [vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT)-2 inhibitor; results in ↓ uptake of monoamines]): Preferred over dopamine- blocking agents; does not cause tardive dyskinesia (TD)

Dopamine-blocking agents: Antipsychotics (eg, fluphenazine, risperidone, haloperidol, pimozide)

For severe, refractory tics: Typical antipsychotics (eg, haldol, pimozide)

α2-agonists (eg, clonidine, guanfacine): Less effective at tic reduction; more favorable side-effect profile

Differential Diagnosis

Persistent (chronic) tic disorder consisting of either motor or vocal tics (but not both) which last >1 year.

KEY FACT

Coprolalia = Repetition of obscene words Echolalia = Repetition of words spoken by others

SEPARATION ANXIETY DISORDER

Disorder characterized by fear of separation from an attachment figure (eg, parent) or home. Separation anxiety normally begins at about 1 year of age and peaks at 18 months. Considered pathologic if it becomes extreme or persists. May be precipitated by a stressful event.

History/PE Fear of separation from an attachment figure or home lasting for ≥4 weeks in children or ≥6 months in adults. May present as complaints of somatic symptoms to avoid school or work.

Diagnosis Excessive fear of separation from attachment figures and three of the following:

attachment figures and distress academic, or occupational attachment figure alone, or be alone

Separation that leads to extreme distress Separation that leads to social, academic, or occupational dysfunction Excessive worry about losing attachment figure Reluctance to leave home, sleep alone, or be alone Nightmares of separation Physical symptoms (eg, a stomachache) when separated
======================================
Treatment Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family therapy, SSRIs as an adjunct to therapy.

PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS

SCHIZOPHRENIA

Disorder of thought process characterized by psychotic symptoms that are further divided into positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thought/behavior) and negative symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal, apathy). Epidemiology: Prevalence is ~1% (males > females). Peak onset is earlier in males (18–

25 years of age) than in females (25–35 years of age). Schizophrenia in first-degree relatives ↑ risk. Up to 50% of patients attempt suicide; 10% of patients with schizophrenia complete suicide.

Etiology: Unknown. Theories focus on neurotransmitter abnormalities such as dopamine dysregulation (frontal hypoactivity and limbic hyperactivity) and brain abnormalities on CT and MRI (enlarged ventricles and ↓ cortical volume).

KEY FACT

Psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions without insight) ≠ schizophrenia. Differential diagnosis must also include organic diseases, other psychiatric illnesses, and substance- induced psychosis.

History/PE Schizophrenia presents with chronic or recurrent psychosis, disorganization, and/or

negative symptoms.

Cognitive impairment in multiple areas (eg, processing speed, working memory, attention, social cognition) may be present.

Mood and anxiety symptoms are common.

Diagnosis Requires two or more of the following symptoms for ≥6 months with social or occupational dysfunction; at least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech:

   Hallucinations (most often auditory)    Delusions    Disorganized speech    Disorganized or catatonic behavior    Negative symptoms: Flattened affect, social withdrawal, anhedonia, apathy, ↓ emotion;  may mimic depression   MNEMONIC

Five As of schizophrenia diagnosis—Affect (flat), Avolition, Asociality, Anhedonia, Apathy

SCHIZOPHRENIFORM

Disorder of thought process. Presentation similar to schizophrenia, but psychotic symptoms are present for 1 to 6 months only.

See Table 2.13-1 for the differential diagnosis of psychosis.
======================================
TABLE 2.13-1. Differential Diagnosis of Psychosis

DISORDER DURATION/CHARACTERISTICS Psychotic Brief psychotic disorder: 1 day to 1 month disorders Schizophreniform disorder: 1-6 months Note: Both present similarly to schizophrenia but are differentiated by dura- tion of illness; can be preceded by stressor(s), are less likely to have negative symptoms, and have a better lifetime prognosis than schizophrenia Schizophrenia: >6 months Schizoaffective disorder: Psychosis + mood disorder (mania or depression); Requires history/presence of: = Psychosis + mood episode AND = Psychosis for =2 weeks without mood episode Personality Schizotypal: “Magical thinking” disorders Schizoid: “Loners” Delusional Persistent delusions (often nonbizarre) without disorganized thought process, disorder hallucinations, or negative symptoms of schizophrenia; subtypes are jealous, paranoid, somatic, erotomanic, or grandiose Symptoms must be present =1 month Day-to-day functioning is mostly unaffected Folie a deux: A shared delusion (commonly between parent and child); the best course of action is to separate the patient pair and treat individually

Prognosis Better prognosis:

Acute onset with positive manifestations (hallucinations and delusions) No family history

Rapid symptom resolution with treatment initiation

Poor prognosis:

Symptoms arise before 13 years of age Insidious course with depressive states Developmental delay; timid, introverted, and uncommunicative before manifesting

symptoms

KEY FACT

In addition to psychotic symptoms, a patient must have mood symptoms present the majority of the time for a physician to differentiate schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia.

KEY FACT

Terms used to describe components of psychosis are as follows: Delusion: A fixed false idiosyncratic belief Hallucination: Perception without an existing external stimulus Illusion: Misperception of an actual external stimulus

Treatment Treatment is usually lifelong and often involves a combination of medications, psychotherapy, social skills training, and coordinated specialty care services.

Pharmacologic intervention with antipsychotic medications can be used to treat the acute symptoms of psychosis, as well as for long-term management and prevention of symptoms (see Table 2.13-2).

======================================
KEY FACT

In those with poor medication adherence or noncompliance, depot (injectable) is preferred because they are longer-acting medications.

KEY FACT

Atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine) are preferred to typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thioridazine, chlorpromazine), given fewer EPSs and anticholinergic effects.

KEY FACT

Resistance is considered when a minimum of two drugs have been attempted previously without improvement of symptoms.

Q

A 24-year-old woman presents to the clinic. She has been “hearing voices” and has isolated herself from her friends and family. She first noticed the voices about 2 months ago when she was feeling sad and reported sleeping poorly. She reports that her mood has since improved and denies any current sleep disturbances but is still hearing the voices. What is her most likely diagnosis?

in social skills, family psychoeducation/therapy difficult to treat than choice. mutism, and immobility) challenge and

Supportive psychotherapy, training in social skills, vocational rehabilitation, and illness education may help. In particular, family psychoeducation/therapy decreases the risk for relapse.

Negative symptoms may be more difficult to treat than positive symptoms; atypical antipsychotics are the drug of choice.

Catatonia (awkward posturing, mutism, and immobility) may be seen in severe disease; this can be treated with benzodiazepine challenge and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Find a description of ECT in the Major Depressive Disorder section later in this chapter.

This patient most likely has schizoaffective disorder, which is characterized by psychosis and intermittent mood symptoms. The diagnosis requires (1) psychotic symptoms AND mood symptoms and (2) at least 2 weeks when psychotic symptoms are present WITHOUT mood symptoms. Patients often have chronic psychotic symptoms, even after mood symptoms have resolved.

DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS

Includes dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization/derealization disorder, and dissociative amnesia. Symptoms are not better explained by substance use, another medical condition, or another mental disorder.

See Table 2.13-4 for an overview of the dissociative disorders.

TABLE 2.13-4. Overview of Dissociative Disorders

DISORDER CHARACTERISTICS Dissociative identity Presence of two or more distinct personalities or identities with disorder (formerly separate memories and behavior patterns that dominate at multiple personality different times. Patients are usually unaware of the other per- disorder) sonalities and complain of frequent gaps in recall and memory lapses. Dissociative identify disorder is more common in females. Associated with history of trauma, child abuse, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and major depressive disorder. Depersonalization/ Recurrent or persistent? experiences of one or more of the derealization following: disorder = Depersonalization: Feeling of detachment from one’s body, actions, thoughts, and perceptions Patient may feel like an outside observer or have “out-of-body” experience » Derealization: Experiencing one’s surroundings as unreal = Still able to identify reality, has insight into the distinction between internal and external reality, unlike in patients with psychosis Dissociative amnesia Inability to recall memories or important personal information, usually after a traumatic or stressful event; procedural memory is preserved. Dissociative fugue: Subtype of dissociative amnesia characterized by sudden, unexpected travel in a dissociated state and subse- quent amnesia of the travel. Increased risk for suicide as amnesia resolves and memories of trauma return. “Transient depersonalization/derealization may occur during times of severe stress; this does not meet diagnostic criteria for DDD.

======================================
ANXIETY DISORDERS

GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER

Uncontrollable, excessive anxiety or worry about multiple topics that leads to significant impairment or distress.

History/PE Clinical onset is usually in the early 20s. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more common in females.

Diagnosis GAD is diagnosed when excessive anxiety or worry about multiple activities is

experienced on most days for ≥6 months.

associated with three or easy fatigue, significant impairment (eg, substances (eg, drug of another psychiatric

Symptoms of anxiety/worry are associated with three or more somatic symptoms (only one required in children): restlessness, easy fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbances.

Symptoms cause a clinically significant impairment (eg, social, occupational). Disturbances are not caused by substances (eg, drug of abuse [eg, cocaine], medication

[eg, amphetamines]).

Disturbance is not better explained by another psychiatric disorder (eg, excessive worry about panic attacks).

Treatment Best initial treatment (first-line): Psychotherapy (CBT, applied relaxation, biofeedback) + SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine, duloxetine). See Table 2.13-5.

TABLE 2.13-5. Anxiolytic Medications

DRUG CLASS INDICATIONS ADVERSE EFFECTS SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine, sertraline, par- oxetine, citalopram, escitalopram) SNRIs (eg, venlafaxine, duloxetine) First-line treatment for GAD, OCD, panic disorder First-line treatment for GAD Nausea, GI upset, somnolence, sexual dys- function, agitation Hypertension, stimulant effects 5-HT partial agonist (eg, buspirone) B-Blocker (propranolol) Benzodiazepines (eg, clonazepam, alprazolam) GAD, Generalized anxiety disorder; Gl, gastrointestinal; OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder.

adult requires.the concentrating)
======================================
KEY FACT

Like SSRIs, buspirone should not be used in conjunction with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. (See Tables 2.13-5 and 2.13-11.)

PANIC DISORDER

Characterized by recurrent, unexpected periods of intense fear that last for several minutes and cause excessive worry about having another panic attack.

History/PE Recurrent episodes of intense fear and discomfort. Symptoms usually last ≤30 minutes. Associated with agoraphobia, increased risk of suicide. More common in females; may occur at any age. There is a strong genetic disposition.

Diagnosis Panic attacks: Discrete periods of intense fear or discomfort in which four or more of the

following symptoms develop abruptly and peak within 10 minutes:

Tachycardia or palpitations, diaphoresis, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, trembling, dizziness, fear of dying or “going crazy,” depersonalization, hot flashes, chills or heat sensation, paresthesia

Increased sensitivity to lactate infusion, which may precipitate an attack in the susceptible

Panic disorder:

Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks Attacks followed by ≥1 month of at least one of the following

Persistent worry/concern of having additional attacks Maladaptive change in behavior (eg, avoidance of unfamiliar situations) Worry about consequences of attack (eg, losing control) Not explained by substances, medications, or another medical condition

KEY FACT

Differential diagnosis for panic disorders: Medical conditions: Angina, myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism,

pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia

Substance-induced anxiety, GAD, Benzodiazepines (eg, clonazepam). dependence and

Psychiatric conditions: Substance-induced anxiety, GAD, PTSD

Treatment See Table 2.13-5 for medications. Acute, initial treatment: Benzodiazepines (eg, clonazepam). Long-term use should be avoided due to concerns of potential dependence and abuse. Benzodiazepines should be tapered as soon as long-term treatment is effective.

Long-term treatment: SSRIs (eg, sertraline). Psychotherapy: CBT; higher rates of response and sustained effects compared with

placebo and pharmacotherapy alone
======================================
PHOBIAS (SOCIAL AND SPECIFIC)

Disorders characterized by excessive fear that is unreasonable and stimulated by the presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation. Patients recognize the fear is excessive. Symptoms are persistent, usually lasting ≥6 months.

History/PE Social anxiety disorder: Presents with excessive fear of criticism, humiliation, and embarrassment in multiple situations requiring social interaction. Patients may have anxiety in anticipation of the event, palpitations and sweating during the event, and they may avoid triggers (eg social events, parties, school).

Performance-only subtype: Symptoms provoked only by performance situations (eg, public speaking, test taking, sexual intercourse).

Specific phobia: Excessive anxiety and fear provoked by exposure to a feared object or situation (eg, animals, heights, airplanes). Most cases begin in childhood.

Agoraphobia: Fear/anxiety of developing paniclike symptoms in two or more situations from which it may be difficult to escape or get help, resulting in avoidance of those situations. Patients may become completely confined to the home. Agoraphobia is associated with panic disorder.

KEY FACT

Agoraphobia is defined as fear of being alone in public places. Literally translated, it means “fear of the marketplace.”

Treatment Social anxiety disorder: Both CBT and SSRIs are first line, and the choice of treatment is

dependent on patient preference. CBT involves desensitization through incremental exposure to the feared object or situation along with relaxation techniques. Second-line treatment includes benzodiazepines (if no history of substance use disorder) or phenelzine (if patient has a history of or risk factors for substance use disorder).

Performance-only subtype: First-line treatment with β-blockers (eg, propranolol) before the event or as needed. Second-line treatment includes CBT, benzodiazepines, and/or SSRIs.

Specific phobia: First-line treatment is CBT. Second-line treatment includes SSRIs, benzodiazepines.

Agoraphobia: CBT, SSRIs.
======================================
KEY FACT

In patients with a history of substance abuse, benzodiazepines should be avoided due to their high potential for addiction.

OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND RELATED DISORDERS

OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER

Characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions that lead to significant distress and dysfunction in social or personal areas. Compulsions are typically time-consuming, often requiring >1 hour daily. OCD typically presents in late adolescence or early adulthood; prevalence is equal in male and female patients. It is often chronic and difficult to treat.

KEY FACT

Abnormalities on brain imaging are common in patients with OCD, specifically in the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia. The cortico-striato–thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder.

KEY FACT

Many patients with OCD initially present to a non-psychiatrist (eg, they may consult a dermatologist with a skin complaint secondary to overwashing their hands).

History/PE Obsessions: Persistent, unwanted, and intrusive ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images that lead to marked anxiety or distress (eg, fear of contamination, fear of harming oneself or loved ones)

Compulsions (or rituals): Repeated mental acts or behaviors that neutralize anxiety from obsessions (eg, handwashing, elaborate rituals for ordinary tasks, counting, excessive checking)

Patients recognize their behaviors as excessive and irrational (vs obsessive-compulsive personality disorder [OCPD]; see Table 2.13-6)

TABLE 2.13-6. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder vs Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Q

A 22-year-old man presents to a physician’s office. He frequently washes his hands, refuses to sit on chairs in public places, and will not use public transportation for fear of contracting diseases. He does not think his behaviors are abnormal, nor does he think his behaviors interfere with his daily activities. What is the diagnosis?

OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE–RELATED DISORDERS

Obsessive-compulsive-related disorders are characterized by unwanted, intrusive, recurrent, and persistent thoughts, urges, or images, as well as repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to those preoccupations. Some obsessive-compulsive–related disorders are primarily body-focused (eg, hair pulling, skin picking) with repeated attempts to decrease or stop the

behaviors. Others involve mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to a rigid set of self-defined “rules” (see Table 2.13-7).

TABLE 2.13-7. Obsessive-Compulsive–Related Disorders

DISORDER CHARACTERISTICS Body dysmorphic Preoccupation with imagined or slight defects in physical appearance disorder that are usually imperceptible to others, leading to significant distress/ impairment The physician should suspect body dysmorphic disorder in patients with an extensive history of cosmetic procedures Therapeutic approach: Acknowledge distress; avoid referring to com- plaints as imagined; evaluate level of insight; encourage patients to avoid unnecessary cosmetic, surgical, or medical treatments Hoarding disorder _ Difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of value; attempts at dis- carding objects causes significant distress; hoarding disorder results in accumulation of objects and can lead to an unsafe living environment Excoriation (skin Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions picking) disorder —_ Excoriation disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social functioning; patient may report repeated attempts to stop or decrease skin picking Differential diagnosis: Pruritus caused by a medical condition (eg, primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) Trichotillomania Recurrent hair pulling leading to hair loss (hair-pulling Trichotillomania causes clinically significant distress or impairment in disorder) social functioning; patients may report repeated attempts to stop or decrease the behavior; clinically, hair follicles in different stages of growth and hair of different lengths will be found Differential diagnosis: Tinea capitis, alopecia Kleptomania Persistent and recurrent impulse to steal items without motivators such as financial gain or personal need Regularly associated with other psychiatric disorders such as OCD, anxiety, eating disorders, and alcohol and substance abuse
======================================
All OCD-related disorders can be treated with CBT and SSRIs.

TRAUMA AND STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS

POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

Disorder characterized by clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning caused by exposure to an extreme, life-threatening traumatic event (eg, war, assault, injury, rape, accident, violent crime). Event can be either directly experienced or witnessed.

This person suffers from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). These patients are perfectionists, are preoccupied with rules and order, and are often inflexible. Unlike patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, those with OCPD typically are not disturbed by their disease.

History/PE Patients experience severe psychological distress when exposed to stimuli that remind them of the event, resulting in avoidance of situations where exposure to triggers is possible

KEY FACT

Top causes of PTSD in male patients are (1) sexual assault and (2) war. Top causes of PTSD in female patients are (1) childhood abuse and (2) sexual assault.

are (1) anxiety, and/or the presence of one Re-experiencing the event

High incidence of substance abuse, anxiety, and/or depression

Diagnosis Exposure to a traumatic event and the presence of one or more of the following:

1. Intrusive symptoms: Re-experiencing the event through nightmares, flashbacks, or intrusive memories

2. Avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma 3. Negative alterations in mood and cognition: Numbed responsiveness (eg, detachment,

anhedonia), guilt, blaming of oneself

4. Changes in arousal and reactivity: ↑ arousal (eg, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response), sleep disturbances, aggression/irritability, and poor concentration

Symptoms lead to significant distress or impairment in functioning Symptoms must persist for >1 month Acute stress disorder: Diagnosed if symptoms are present for ≤1 month

Clinical presentation is the same as PTSD Symptoms last ≥3 days but <1 month Symptoms present within 1 month of experiencing the traumatic event
======================================
Treatment Best initial treatment:

PTSD: CBT + SSRIs or SNRIs Acute stress disorder: Trauma-focused CBT or eye movement desensitization and

reprocessing therapy

Pharmacotherapy: SSRIs or SNRIs as a second-line option

Prazosin (α1-blocker) is used to treat PTSD-related nightmares

A

CBT alone, SSRIs alone, or a combination of both have been found to be similarly effective

NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS

Disorders that affect memory, orientation, judgment, and attention.

Dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder)

A decline in cognitive functioning with global deficits. Level of consciousness is stable (vs delirium). Prevalence is highest among those >85 years of age. The course is persistent and progressive. The most common causes are Alzheimer disease (65%) and vascular dementia (20%). Other causes are outlined in the mnemonic DEMENTIASS.

History/PE Patients with dementia are usually not concerned about their cognitive decline and are

often accompanied to the doctor visit by a family member or friend (vs major depressive disorder [MDD]/pseudodementia).

Dementia is characterized by progressive memory impairment that can be classified into the following four stages:

Preclinical: Slight forgetfulness, fully oriented, and capable of caring for oneself. Mild: Moderate memory loss, impaired executive function, impaired function at home

Mild: Moderate memory loss, impaired executive function, impaired function at home but capable of maintaining most chores. Personal hygiene may need prompting.

but capable of maintaining most chores. Personal hygiene may need prompting. Moderate: Severe memory loss, inability to recognize friends (agnosia), impaired

social judgement; requires assistance with dressing and personal hygiene.

Severe: Severe memory loss, oriented only to person, completely dependent on others for ADLs; may develop aphasia and become incommunicable.

Personality, mood, and behavior changes are common (eg, wandering and aggression).

Diagnosis Diagnosis is clinical. History, PE, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) <24 or

Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) <26

The physician should rule out treatable causes of dementia. Obtain a urinalysis (UA), complete blood cell count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), vitamin B12, folate, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), thyroid function tests (TFTs), HIV, rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and a head CT/MRI.

Definitive diagnosis requires autopsy and histopathologic exam (rarely performed). Table 2.13-8 outlines key characteristics distinguishing dementia from delirium.

Treatment Pharmacotherapy:

Best initial treatment: Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine)

Moderate/severe Alzheimer dementia: Addition of memantine (N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] antagonist)

Aggression/psychosis: Low-dose antipsychotics (use with caution in older adults; black box warning for increased mortality)

Avoidance of benzodiazepines, which may exacerbate disinhibition and confusion

Provide environmental cues and a rigid structure for the patient’s daily life Family, caregiver, and patient education and support are imperative

DELIRIUM

An acute disturbance of consciousness with altered cognition that develops over a short period (usually hours to days). Children, older adults, and hospitalized patients (eg, intensive care unit [ICU] psychosis) are particularly susceptible. Symptoms are potentially reversible if the underlying cause can be treated.

History/PE Delirium presents with acute onset of waxing and waning consciousness with lucid

intervals and perceptual disturbances (hallucinations, illusions, delusions).

Patients may be combative, anxious, paranoid, or stuporous. Patients have ↓ attention span and short-term memory, a reversed sleep-wake cycle, and ↑

symptoms at night (sundowning).

Procure history and conduct physical and neurologic examinations. Check vital signs, pulse oximetry, electrolytes, glucose, CBC, and UA.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Investigate common causes of delirium. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common cause of delirium in older adults. Note recent medication additions/changes (eg, narcotics, anticholinergics, steroids,

benzodiazepines).

Evaluate for substance abuse and medical problems (eg, renal failure, liver failure).

superimposed on dementia.

KEY FACT

It is common for delirium to be superimposed on dementia.

MOOD DISORDERS

Also known as affective disorders.

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER

A mood disorder characterized by one or more major depressive episodes (MDEs). The male- to-female ratio is 1:2; lifetime prevalence ranges from 15% to 25%. Onset is usually in the mid-20s; in older adults, prevalence ↑ with age. Chronic illness and stress ↑ risk. Approximately 2% to 9% of patients die by suicide.
======================================
MNEMONIC

Symptoms of a depressive episode— SIG E CAPS Sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia) Interest (loss of interest or pleasure in activities) Guilt (feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt) Energy (↓) or fatigue

Concentration (↓) Appetite (↑ or ↓) or weight (↑ or ↓) Psychomotor agitation or retardation Suicidal ideation

KEY FACT

Major depressive episodes can be present in major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorder types I and II.

KEY FACT

Minors with suicidal ideation should be hospitalized involuntarily with or without parental consent (although parental consent is preferred).

Subtypes include the following:

Psychotic features: Generally mood-congruent delusions/hallucinations. Psychosis only occurs during the MDD episode (distinguished from schizoaffective disorder).

Postpartum: Occurs within 1 to 3 months postpartum; has a 10% incidence and a high risk for recurrence. Psychotic symptoms are common (see Table 2.13-11).

Atypical: Characterized by weight gain, hypersomnia, and rejection sensitivity. Seasonal: Depressive episodes occurring during a specific season (most commonly winter). This subtype responds well to light therapy with or without antidepressants.

MNEMONIC

TCA toxicity— Tri Cs Convulsions Coma Cardiac arrhythmias 

Diagnosis Diagnosis requires depressed mood or anhedonia (loss of interest/pleasure) and five or more signs/symptoms from the SIG E CAPS mnemonic for ≥2 weeks.

Treatment Pharmacotherapy: Best initial treatment is with an SSRI (eg, fluoxetine [drug of

choice], sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram). A partial response to SSRIs can be augmented with bupropion or aripiprazole.

Allow 2 to 6 weeks for medication to take effect. Dose can be adjusted as needed. The patient should continue taking the medication for at least 6 months (at the same

effective dose) beyond the time of achieving full remission.

If a patient fails to respond to the initial antidepressant, they can be switched to another first-line agent (SSRI). Agents alternatively used, based on patient comorbidities and second-line treatment, include those listed in Table 2.13-12.

Most effective treatment: Psychotherapy + antidepressants are more effective than either treatment alone.

ECT: A small electrical current is used to induce a generalized seizure under anesthesia. It is a safe and highly effective treatment option for severe depression. ECT usually requires two to three treatments per week for a total of 6 to 12 treatments. Indications are as follows:

Refractory or treatment-resistant depression MDD with psychotic features Need for rapid improvement: Actively suicidal, refusal to eat/drink, catatonia,

pregnancy

Bipolar depression or mania No absolute contraindications. Relative contraindications include recent myocardial

infarction (MI)/stroke, intracranial mass, and high anesthetic risk

Adverse effects: Anterograde amnesia, postictal confusion, arrhythmias, and headache

Phototherapy: This is effective for depression with seasonal pattern.

KEY FACT

It is important to rule out bipolar disorder before treating major depressive disorder because SSRIs can cause mania in those with bipolar disorder.
======================================
KEY FACT

Those with two or more episodes should be prescribed maintenance antidepressant therapy for 1 to 3 years. Those with three or more episodes should have indefinite therapy prescribed.

KEY FACT

Discontinue SSRIs at least 2 weeks before starting an MAOI. Wait 5 weeks if the patient was on fluoxetine due to its long half-life.

PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (DYSTHYMIA)

History/PE Persistent depressive disorder refers to a chronic depressed mood including at least two

depressive symptoms (one in children) present on most days for >2 years with no symptom-free periods lasting more than 2 months.

Patients often have felt depressed for as long as they can remember. Double depression: Diagnosed if patient meets criteria for MDD during dysthymic

periods.

Adjustment disorder, which consists of emotional and behavioral symptoms that develop in response to an identifiable stressor, lasts >1 month and <6 months, and does not have five or more symptoms of major depressive disorder.

Treatment Psychotherapy is the most effective treatment. Persistent depressive disorder is often resistant to treatment. Treatments to consider are

antidepressants (eg, SSRIs) and ECT.

ADJUSTMENT DISORDER

A

Clinically significant distress following a profound life change (eg, divorce, unemployment, financial issues, romantic breakup); it is not severe enough to meet criteria for another mental disorder.

History/PE Patients develop anxiety or depressive symptoms (eg, anhedonia, depressed mood, weight

loss) following a stressful life event (eg, divorce, death of family member, change in school/work).

Event is not life-threatening. Symptoms present within 3 months after onset of the stressor. Adjustment disorder

resolves within 6 months after event is over.

Adjustment disorder causes social or occupational dysfunction, as opposed to a normal stress reaction.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Psychotherapy focusing on coping skills and supportive

counseling

psychiatric emergency antipsychotics (lithium/valproate) + Antipsychotics—typical
======================================
Best initial treatment: Lithium

Acute mania: Considered a psychiatric emergency because of impaired judgment and risk for harm to self or others

Mild to moderate mania: Atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine) Severe mania: Mood stabilizer (lithium/valproate) + antipsychotic Refractory mania: ECT Mania/hypomania in pregnancy: Antipsychotics—typical antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) are generally first line and have fewer risks to the developing fetus than mood stabilizers. ECT can be used for severe or refractory mania in pregnancy

Bipolar depression: Mood stabilizers with or without antidepressants. The patient should begin taking the mood stabilizer first to avoid inducing mania. The physician may also try a combination of mood stabilizer and antipsychotic if monotherapy fails

PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Personality can be defined as an individual’s set of emotional and behavioral traits, which are generally stable and predictable. Personality disorders are defined when one’s traits become chronically rigid and maladaptive, leading to social or occupational dysfunction. Disorders are outlined in Table 2.13-15.
======================================
TABLE 2.13-15. Signs and Symptoms of Personality Disorders

CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 59-year-old man who lives alone constantly feels that his neighbor's children are spying on him and plotting to break into his home. He has installed security cameras all around his property to obtain proof. He feels he cannot trust the police to do a good job because they will probably take the side of his neighbors, A 66-year-old man who moves to Thailand alone after retirement, has no desire to remain in contact with his family, and is very distant in his interactions. He stays in his remote accommodations without unneces- sary travel and does not crave interaction with the locals. A 35-year-old man with very strange ideas regarding the importance of crystals and their effects on health. He meticulously mines and collects crystals, feeling that they will one day prevent him from acquiring cancer. A 28-year-old woman presents to the clinic after having praised her new clinician as better than all the others. She reveals that she fired her last therapist, as he was not really helping. The physician notices she has fresh cuts in a row on her forearm, A 35-year-old woman presents to clinic wearing a very low-cut blouse and adjusting her position to draw attention to herself. When she does not get attention, she breaks into tears, saying that no one notices her, not even her friends. A 45-year-old man impatiently taps his foot in the waiting room of the office. He approaches the receptionist, demands to know where the doctor is, and tells her that he will have her fired and the doctor reported if he is not ‘seen shortly as he believes his time is being wasted in a queue. DISORDER CHARACTERISTICS CLUSTER A: “WEIRD” Paranoid Distrustful, suspicious; interprets others’ motives as malevolent Note: These patients commonly use projection as adefense mechanism Schizoid Isolated, detached "loners" who prefer to be alone Restricted emotional expression Schizotypal Odd behavior, perceptions, and appearance Magical thinking; ideas of reference CLUSTER B: “WILD” Borderline Unstable mood, relationships, and self-image; feelings of emptiness Impulsive History of suicidal ideation or self-harm Note: These patients often employ splitting asa defense mechanism (see Table 2.13-16) Histrionic Excessively emotional and attention seeking Sexually provocative; theatrical Narcissistic Grandiose; needs admiration; has sense of entitlement Lack of empathy Antisocial Violates rights of others, social norms, and laws; impulsive; lacks remorse Must be >18 years of age Evidence of conduct disorder before 15 years of age CLUSTER C:“WORRIED AND WIMPY” Obsessive- Preoccupied with perfection, order, and control A 22-year-old man who has committed a brutal assault is at a court-ordered psychiatry appointment. When a teenager, he was in juvenile detention for theft. He says he does not need to be seen by a “shrink” and that because he was offended by the victim, they deserved to be assaulted. A35-year-old woman presents to the office at the request of her boss, compulsive at the expense of efficiency Inflexible morals and values Note: Remember, in contrast to obsessive- compulsive disorder, patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder do not feel their behavior is problematic (ego-syn- tonic); they also do not have true obsessions and compulsions who feels she is too focused on minute details on team projects and does not allow others to participate for fear of unwanted errors.

DISORDER CHARACTERISTICS CLINICAL PRESENTATION Avoidant Socially inhibited, sensitive to rejection A 33-year-old man stays at home to avoid an office party, as he fears Fear of being disliked or ridiculed, yet desires to having to make small talk. He wants to go, but he is more afraid that he have friends and social interactions will be inadequate or rejected by others. Dependent Submissive, clingy; feels a need to be taken care A 30-year-old woman presents to the physician's office in crisis, saying that of Has difficulty making decisions Feels helpless her parents just kicked her out of their house and that she is struggling to survive on her own. She says she cannot make her own choices at the grocery store, as her mother would always care for her, and now these decisions are overwhelming. She has been sitting outside of their house daily, hoping they will let her live there again.

Defense mechanisms are methods of dealing with anxiety or conflicts of the ego (eg, anger, guilt, inadequacy, grief). These can be immature (more primitive) or mature (more sophisticated). Immature defense mechanisms are common in personality disorders. Important defense mechanisms are outlined in Table 2.13-16.

TABLE 2.13-16. Defense Mechanisms

IMMATURE Acting out Expressing unacceptable feelings and thoughts through actions Denial Acting as if an aspect of reality does not exist; refusing to accept the situation Displacement Transferring feelings or impulses to a more neutral object Intellectualization Using facts and logic to avoid stressful thoughts or emotions Passive aggression Demonstrating hostile feelings in a nonconfrontational manner Projection Attributing an unacceptable internal impulse to others (vs displacement) Associated with paranoid personality disorder Rationalization Explaining unacceptable behaviors in a rational or logical manner Reaction formation Behaving in a manner opposite to one's true feelings and thoughts Regression Involuntarily reverting to an earlier developmental stage Associated with dependent personality disorder Splitting Believing that people are either all bad or all good Associated with borderline personality disorder MATURE Sublimation Channeling an unacceptable thought/wish into a socially acceptable outlet or behavior Altruism Coping with difficult stressors by meeting the needs of others Suppression Intentionally avoiding unwanted thoughts or feelings to deal with reality Humor Joking about an uncomfortable or anxiety-provoking situation

or impulses to a more logic to avoid stressful thoughts hostile feelings in a unacceptable internal impulse
======================================
Diagnosis

Diagnosis is clinical, and detailed history taking is imperative. Collateral information may be helpful. Patients typically deny or do not realize they have a problem (ego syntonic).

SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS

DISORDERS pattern of substance applied to most’substances period for diagnosis. as follows:

Substance use disorder is a maladaptive pattern of substance use that leads to clinically significant impairment. It can be applied to most substances of abuse. The patient must meet ≥2 of the 11 criteria within a 1-year period for diagnosis. The criteria can be grouped into four categories of symptoms and are as follows:

Impaired control:

1. Consumption of greater amounts of the substance than intended 2. Failed attempts to cut down use or abstain from the substance 3. Increased amount of time spent acquiring the substance, using it, or recovering from

3. Increased amount of time spent acquiring the substance, using it, or recovering from effects

effects 4. Craving

Social impairment:

5. Failure to fulfill responsibilities at work, school, or home 6. Continued substance use despite recurrent social or interpersonal problems secondary to

the effects of such use (eg, frequent arguments with spouse over the substance use)

7. Isolation from life activities

Risky use:

8. Use of substances in physically hazardous situations (eg, driving while intoxicated) 9. Continued substance abuse despite recurrent physical or psychological problems

secondary to the effects of the substance use

Pharmacologic:

10. Tolerance and use of progressively larger amounts to obtain the same desired effects 11. Withdrawal symptoms when not taking the substance

Tolerance and withdrawal are not needed to make the diagnosis.
======================================
Withdrawal:

Physiologic syndrome that occurs when concentrations of a substance decline in an individual who has had prolonged heavy use of that substance

Symptoms vary greatly across substances, but when they occur, the individual is likely to consume the substance again in order to relieve the symptoms

For most substances, a history of withdrawal is usually associated with a more severe clinical course

Diagnosis/Treatment Diagnosis is typically clinical, and detailed history-taking is imperative Lab tests: Urine and blood toxicology screens, liver function tests (LFTs), and serum

ethanol (EtOH)

KEY FACT

Pinpoint pupils are not always a reliable sign of opioid ingestion, because co-ingestions can lead to normal or enlarged pupils. Also look for a ↓ respiratory rate, track marks, and ↓ breath sounds.

KEY FACT

for all patients with abuse. In the appropriate the use of opioids in pain shared decision making. of symptoms present

Acute pain management is the same for all patients with severe pain refractory to NSAIDs regardless of a history of substance abuse. In the appropriate clinical setting, prior substance abuse is not a contraindication to the use of opioids in pain management and requires a nonjudgmental environment and shared decision making.

Severity is determined by number of symptoms present

Mild: Two to three; moderate: four to five; severe: six or more Symptoms of intoxication and withdrawal from selected drugs are described in Table

ALCOHOL USE DISORDER

Occurs more often in males (4:1) and in those 21 to 34 years of age, although the incidence in females is rising. Alcohol use disorder is associated with a positive family history.

History/PE See Table 2.13-17 for the symptoms of intoxication and withdrawal. The physician should

look for palmar erythema or telangiectasias and for other signs and symptoms of end-organ complications. Patients often present with sleep disturbances or anxiety symptoms caused by mild withdrawal.

Diagnosis Screening can be done with the CAGE questionnaire. The physician should monitor vital

signs for evidence of withdrawal.

Labs may reveal ↑ LFTs (classically aspartate aminotransferase [AST]: alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ratio >2:1), ↑ lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ↑ carbohydrate- deficient transferrin, and ↑ mean corpuscular volume.

MNEMONIC

CAGE questionnaire:

1. Have you ever felt the need to Cut down on your drinking? 2. Have you ever felt Annoyed by criticism of your drinking? 3. Have you ever felt Guilty about drinking? 4. Have you ever had to take a morning Eye opener?

More than one “yes” answer makes alcohol use disorder likely.

Naltrexone (!-opioid receptor Alcoholics Anonymous) (acetaldehyde:dehydrogenase

Treatment Abstinence:

Best initial treatment: Naltrexone (μ-opioid receptor blocker) ↓ cravings; can start while patient is still drinking

Long-term rehabilitation (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous)

Aversion: Disulfiram (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor): Produces an unpleasant response (eg, flushing, nausea, vertigo, palpitations) when EtOH is consumed

KEY FACT

Naltrexone is a first-line pharmacotherapy to reduce the craving for alcohol. It works by blocking the μ-opioid receptor and can be given to patients who are still drinking.

Withdrawal:

Stabilization of vital signs; correction of electrolyte abnormalities Thiamine (administer before glucose to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy), glucose,

and folic acid

Medium-length benzodiazepine taper (eg, lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) Addition of haloperidol for hallucinations and psychotic symptoms

Complications Gastritis (gastrointestinal [GI] bleeds, ulcers), varices, or Mallory-Weiss tears Pancreatitis, liver disease, delirium tremens (DTs), alcoholic hallucinosis (see Table 2.13- 18, Fig. 2.13-2), peripheral neuropathy, Wernicke encephalopathy, Korsakoff psychosis, fetal alcohol syndrome, cardiomyopathy, anemia, aspiration pneumonia, ↑ risk for sustaining trauma (eg, subdural hematoma)

EATING DISORDERS

ANOREXIA NERVOSA

Risk factors include female sex, low self-esteem, and high socioeconomic status. Associated with OCD; MDD; anxiety; and careers/hobbies such as modeling, gymnastics, ballet, and running

History/PE Patients are often perfectionists and high achieving. They have a distorted body image and

fear of gaining weight. Anorexia nervosa is divided into two subtypes:

Restrictive: Severe restriction of food intake is primary method of weight loss. Binge eating/purging: Food intake is compensated by purging (eg, excessive exercise,

vomiting, laxative/diuretic abuse).

Signs and symptoms: Cachexia, body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2, lanugo, dry skin, bradycardia, lethargy, hypotension, cold intolerance, and hypothermia (as low as 35°C [95°F]).

See Table 2.13-20 to differentiate anorexia nervosa from bulimia nervosa.

TABLE 2.13-20. Anorexia Nervosa vs Bulimia Nervosa

CHARACTERISTIC ANOREXIA NERVOSA BULIMIA NERVOSA Presentation Persistent restriction of caloric intake resulting in low body Episodes of binge eating followed by compensa- weight; intense fear of gaining weight; distorted body tory behaviors (eg, purging, fasting, excessive image (patients perceive themselves as overweight or exercise) obese) Episodes occur at least once a week for =3 months Weight Patients are underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m?) Patients are of normal weight or are overweight (BMI >18.5 kg/m?) Attitude toward illness Treatment Patients are typically not distressed by their illness and may thus be resistant to treatment Monitor calorie intake and weight gain; hospitalize if necessary Watch for refeeding syndrome (electrolyte abnormalities [L phosphate], arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and seizures after sudden increase in caloric intake) Psychotherapy: Address maladaptive family dynamics Antidepressants (SSRIs): Note that these are not effective until weight is restored Treat comorbidities; avoid bupropion because of risk for seizure Patients are typically distressed about their symp- toms and are thus easier to treat Psychotherapy + antidepressants (SSRIs) Treat comorbidities; avoid bupropion because of risk for seizure

Diagnosis Measure height and weight; check BMI; check CBC, electrolytes, endocrine levels, and

ECG.

BULIMIA NERVOSA

Eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and compensatory purging behavior (eg, vomiting, laxative/diuretic abuse, excessive exercise). More common in females; associated with low self-esteem, mood disorders, and OCD.

History/PE Patients often have a long history of other comorbid psychiatric conditions (eg, anxiety,

depression) and are concerned about their behaviors.

Signs: Dental enamel erosion, enlarged parotid glands, scars on the dorsal hand surfaces (if there is a history of repeated induced vomiting), and BMI >18.5 kg/m2 are signs of bulimia nervosa.

See Table 2.13-20 to differentiate anorexia nervosa from bulimia nervosa.

Treatment See Table 2.13-20.

Complications See Table 2.13-21 for a summary of complications related to eating disorders.

In females, estrogen levels ↓ after menopause, leading to vaginal dryness and thinning, which may result in discomfort during coitus. The patient may be treated with hormone replacement therapy, estrogen vaginal suppositories, or other vaginal creams.
======================================
PARAPHILIC DISORDERS

Preoccupation with or engagement in unusual sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors for >6 months with clinically significant impairment of one’s life. There are eight classified disorders, characterized by disordered courtship (voyeurism, exhibitionism, and frotteurism), disordered preferences (pedophilia, transvestic fetishism, fetishism), and pleasure in inflicting/receiving pain (sadism, masochism). See Table 2.13-22.

TABLE 2.13-22. Features of Common Paraphilic Disorders

DISORDER CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Exhibitionistic Sexual arousal from exposing one’s genitals to a stranger Pedophilic Urges or behaviors involving sexual activities with children Voyeuristic Observing unsuspecting people unclothed or involved in sex Fetishistic Use of nonliving objects (often clothing) for sexual arousal Transvestic Cross-dressing for sexual arousal Frotteuristic Touching or rubbing one’s genitalia against a nonconsenting person (common in crowded places) Sexual sadism Sexual arousal from inflicting suffering on sexual partner Sexual masochism Sexual arousal from being hurt, humiliated, bound, or threatened

Tx: Includes insight-oriented psychotherapy and behavioral therapy. Antiandrogens (eg, a medroxyprogesterone injection) have been used for hypersexual paraphilic activity.

GENDER DYSPHORIA

Significant incongruence between one’s gender identity and one’s gender assigned at birth, lasting >6 months and leading to persistent distress. Individuals experience marked discomfort with assigned gender, which interferes with social, academic, and other areas of function. More common in males than females.

History/PE More common in males than in females. Gender dysphoria is associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and personality disorders. Some individuals who are transgender will experience gender dysphoria. Nonconformity to one’s assigned gender itself is not a mental disorder. Gender dysphoria is associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and personality disorders.

Treatment Address comorbid psychiatric conditions. If the patient is interested, discuss options for

gender-affirming surgery or hormonal treatment.

In teens, hormone suppression therapy can be offered to delay puberty, but this decision should be made with support from family, if possible. One should also assess safety and multidisciplinary specialist services.
======================================
SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION

History/PE Problems in sexual arousal, desire, or orgasm or pain with sexual intercourse

Prevalence: 30%; one-third of cases are attributable to biologic factors, and another third to psychological factors

Treatment Depends on the condition. Pharmacologic strategies include phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil). If dysfunction is caused by antidepressants (SSRIs), the physician can institute a switch to bupropion. Psychotherapeutic strategies include sensate focusing.

SLEEP DISORDERS

Up to one-third of all American adults suffer from some type of sleep disorder during their lives. Dyssomnia describes any condition that leads to a disturbance in the normal rhythm or pattern of sleep. Insomnia is the most common example. Risk factors include female sex, the presence of mental and medical disorders, substance abuse, and advanced age.

Normal age-related sleep changes include more frequent waking, decreased total time asleep, and increased napping.

PRIMARY INSOMNIA

Affects up to 30% of the general population; causes sleep disturbance that is not attributable to physical or mental conditions. Insomnia is often exacerbated by anxiety, and patients may become preoccupied with getting enough sleep.

population; causes sleep Insomnia is often exacerbated enough sleep. nonrestorative sleep or times.per week for 1

History/PE Patients present with a history of nonrestorative sleep or difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that is present at least three times per week for 1 month.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Initiate good sleep hygiene measures. Next best treatment: Psychotherapy, specifically CBT for insomnia (CBTi).

Pharmacotherapy can be initiated with care for short periods of time (<2 weeks). Pharmacologic agents include diphenhydramine, zolpidem, zaleplon, and trazodone.

KEY FACT

Sleep hygiene measures—stimulus control therapy to reestablish a 24-hour sleep/wake cycle: Establish a sleep schedule Limit caffeine intake Avoid naps Take warm baths in the evening Use the bedroom for sleep and sexual activity only Exercise early in the day Employ relaxation techniques Avoid large meals near bedtime
======================================
PRIMARY HYPERSOMNIA

Diagnosis Diagnosed when a patient complains of excessive daytime sleepiness or nighttime sleep that occurs for >1 month. The excessive somnolence cannot be attributable to medical or mental illness, medications, poor sleep hygiene, insufficient sleep, or narcolepsy.

Treatment Best initial treatment: CNS stimulants (eg, amphetamines) Antidepressants such as SSRIs may be useful in some patients

NARCOLEPSY

Onset typically occurs by young adulthood, generally before 30 years of age. Some forms of narcolepsy may have a genetic component.

Diagnosis Manifestations include excessive daytime somnolence and ↓ rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency at least three times a week for at least 3 months. Hypocretin deficiency (confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] sampling) is also diagnostic of this condition. Sleep attacks are the classic symptom; patients cannot avoid falling asleep.

Characteristic excessive sleepiness may be associated with the following:

Cataplexy: Sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to collapse Hypnagogic hallucinations: Occur as the patient is falling asleep Hypnopompic hallucinations: Occur as the patient awakens Sleep paralysis: Brief paralysis upon awakening

MNEMONIC

HypnaGOgic = hallucinations while GOing to bed HypnoPOMPic = hallucinations while POMPing out of bed

Treatment A regimen of scheduled daily naps plus stimulant drugs such as amphetamines or modafinil; SSRIs for cataplexy.

Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea occurs secondary to disturbances in breathing during sleep that lead to excessive daytime somnolence and sleep disruption. Etiologies can be either central or peripheral.

Central sleep apnea (CSA): A condition in which both airflow and respiratory effort cease. CSA is linked to morning headaches, mood changes, and repeated awakenings during the night.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): A condition in which airflow ceases as a result of obstruction along the respiratory passages. OSA is strongly associated with snoring.

Risk factors: Male sex, obesity, prior upper airway surgeries, a deviated nasal septum, a large uvula or tongue, and retrognathia (recession of the mandible).

In both forms, arousal results in cessation of the apneic event.

Sleep apnea is associated with sudden death in infants and older adults, headaches, depression, ↑ systolic blood pressure (BP), and pulmonary hypertension.

Diagnosis Sleep study (polysomnography) to document the number of arousals, obstructions, and episodes of ↓ O2 saturation; distinguish OSA from CSA; and identify possible movement disorders, seizures, or other sleep disorders.

Treatment OSA: Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Weight loss if obese. In

children, most cases are caused by tonsillar/adenoidal hypertrophy, which is corrected surgically.

CSA: Mechanical ventilation (eg, bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) with a backup rate for severe cases.
======================================
CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SLEEP DISORDER

A spectrum of disorders characterized by a misalignment between desired and actual sleep periods. Subtypes include jet lag, shift work, delayed sleep phase (“night owls”), advanced sleep phase (“early birds”), and unspecified causes.

by a misalignment shift work, delayed sleep unspecified causes: 2 to.7 days without types may respond disorder.

Treatment Jet-lag type usually resolves within 2 to 7 days without specific treatment. Shift-work and delayed sleep-phase types may respond to light therapy. Modafinil is

approved for shift-work sleep disorder.

Oral melatonin may be useful if given 30 minutes before the desired bedtime.

Q

A 57-year-old morbidly obese man presents to his physician with concerns about ↑ daytime sleepiness and ↓ work productivity. His wife adds that he has excessive snoring that sounds like “the snort of a steam engine.” What long-term complications are of concern for this patient?

SOMATIC SYMPTOM AND RELATED DISORDERS

SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDER

Patients often present with excessive thoughts, anxiety, and behaviors driven by the presence of somatic symptoms that are distressing and negatively affect daily life. Somatic symptom disorder may occur with or without any medical illness present. High health care utilization is often present. Disorder may present with multiple recurrent somatic symptoms that may be specific (eg, localized pain) or nonspecific (eg, fatigue). Even normal bodily symptoms can

be perceived as unduly threatening, even when there is evidence to the contrary.

Treatment Scheduling regular appointments with one clinician as primary caregiver Avoiding unnecessary diagnostics but legitimizing symptoms Psychotherapy focused on reducing psychosocial stressors

ILLNESS ANXIETY DISORDER

Formerly known as hypochondria. For at least 6 months, patients have anxiety about and preoccupation with acquiring a serious medical illness despite having no somatic symptoms (or mild somatic symptoms), a normal physical examination, negative tests, and reassurance from a health care provider. The patient’s preoccupation with illness is not better explained by another disorder. In addition to the aforementioned, patients must have one of the following: excessive health behaviors (eg, repeated checking for signs of an illness) or maladaptive avoidance of situations (eg, health care settings, visiting sick family members).
======================================
KEY FACT

Psychogenic/nonepileptic spells can co-occur with a seizure disorder.

Treatment CBT (first line) Another type of psychotherapy (second line) Antidepressant medication (third line)

CONVERSION DISORDER

Also known as functional neurologic symptom disorder. Characterized by symptoms or deficits of voluntary motor or sensory function (eg, blindness, seizurelike movements, paralysis) incompatible with medical processes. Close temporal relationship to stress or intense emotion.

Diagnosis Symptoms unexplained by other medical or neurologic causes Signs during physical examination suggesting nonorganic cause of symptoms:

Presence of Hoover sign (extension of affected leg when asked to raise the unaffected contralateral leg) when attempting to rule out leg paralysis

Eyes closed and resistant to opening during seizure; negative simultaneous EEG Disappearance of tremors with distraction

La belle indifference: Patients are strangely indifferent to their symptoms; commonly associated but not required for the diagnosis

This patient has obstructive sleep apnea. Serious consequences include leg swelling, hypertension, cor pulmonale, stroke, and clinical depression.

Treatment Psychotherapy, physical therapy (PT)/occupation therapy (OT), treating comorbid

psychiatric issues (anxiety, depression, trauma)

Goal: Improve function

FACTITIOUS DISORDERS AND MALINGERING

Diagnosis Factitious disorder (formerly Munchausen syndrome): Characterized by the fabrication

of symptoms or self-injury to assume the sick role (primary gain)

Factitious disorder imposed on another (formerly Munchausen by proxy): Caregiver exaggerates or falsifies medical/psychiatric symptoms or intentionally induces illness in someone else to receive benefit by taking on the role of concerned caregiver

Malingering: Patients intentionally cause or feign symptoms for secondary gain (eg, financial, housing, legal)

KEY FACT

Factitious disorders and malingering are distinct from somatoform disorders in that they involve conscious and intentional processes.

Treatment Psychotherapy Minimal diagnostics and treatment to avoid reinforcement of behaviors Contacting appropriate legal authorities (factitious disorder imposed on another)
======================================
SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE

Most frequently affects females <35 years of age who:

Are experiencing marital discord and have a personal history of, or a partner with, substance abuse

Are pregnant, have low socioeconomic status, or have obtained a restraining order

Victims of childhood abuse are more likely to become adult victims of abuse

History/PE Patients typically have multiple somatic complaints, frequent emergency department visits, and unexplained injuries with delayed medical treatment. They may also avoid eye contact or act afraid or hostile.

Children may exhibit precocious sexual behavior, genital or anal trauma, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), UTIs, and/or psychiatric/behavioral problems (see Pediatrics chapter).

Other clues include a partner who answers questions for the patient or refuses to leave the examination room.

Treatment Perform a screening assessment of the patient’s safety domestically and in their close

personal relationships.

Provide medical care, emotional support, and counseling. Educate the patient about support services and refer the patient appropriately. Documentation is crucial. Know local laws for reporting suspected child/elder abuse.

KEY FACT

Sexual abusers are usually male and are often known to the victim (and are often family members).

SEXUAL ASSAULT

Any sexual act performed on another individual without their consent.

Diagnostic Evaluation and Testing Assessment for physical injury with focus on genital trauma Psychological evaluation Pregnancy test Testing for sexually transmitted infections

infections and gonorrhea trichomonas HIV, herpes simplex (CMV) history and samples clippings, blood

Smear/culture for chlamydia and gonorrhea Wet mount and culture for trichomonas Consideration of testing for HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV),

syphilis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV)

Forensic evaluation with detailed history and samples from buccal mucosa, vagina, rectum, fingernail scraping and clippings, blood samples, and saliva samples

Important historical details include contraceptive use, last time of coitus, condom use before the assault, drug or alcohol use, history of STDs, description of the assailant, location and time of the assault, circumstances of the assault (eg, penile penetration, use of condoms, extragenital acts, use or display of weapons), and the patient’s actions since the assault (eg, douching, bathing, brushing teeth, urination/defecation, changing clothes).

Postexposure Prophylaxis and Evaluation Follow-up medical visit within 1 to 2 weeks Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin ± metronidazole for prophylaxis against gonorrhea and

chlamydia

Hepatitis B booster vaccination if unknown vaccination and immune status or if unvaccinated

HIV: Antiretroviral drug offered within 72 hours of assault; options are tenofovir- emtricitabine + raltegravir

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommended at time of initial evaluation in female survivors ages 9 to 26 years and male survivors ages 9 to 21 years
======================================
Contraception Emergency contraception: Progestin/antagonist/agonist ulipristal or levonorgestrel or

combination ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (Yuzpe regimen)

SUICIDALITY

Accounts for 45,000 deaths per year in the United States; the 10th overall cause of death in the United States. Approximately one suicide occurs every 11 minutes.

Risk factors: Previous suicide attempt (primary risk factor), male sex, >45 years of age, psychiatric disorders (eg, MDD, presence of psychotic symptoms), history of psychiatric hospitalization, history of violent behavior, ethanol or substance abuse, recent severe stressors, poor social support, and a family history of suicide (see SAD PERSONS mnemonic).

Females are more likely to attempt suicide. Men use more lethal methods (eg, firearms) and are more likely to complete suicide.

Adults aged 45 to 64 have higher rates of death from suicides than other age groups. However, young adults aged 18 to 25 are at higher risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts than other age groups.

Protective factors: Social support, family connectedness, religiosity, pregnancy, and parenthood.

KEY FACT

Suicide is the second leading cause of death (after unintentional injury) among 15- to 24- year-olds in the United States.

Diagnosis Perform a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. Ask about family history, previous attempts, ambivalence toward death, and hopelessness. Ask directly about suicidal ideation, intent, and plan, and look for available means.

KEY FACT

Emergent inpatient hospitalization is required for patients with suicidal intentions.

Treatment A patient who endorses suicidality requires emergent inpatient hospitalization even against

their will.

Suicide risk may increase after antidepressant therapy is initiated and is considered an adverse effect of the medication. There is a black box warning on all antidepressant medications when used in those <24 years of age.

======================================
KEY FACT

FEV1/FVC ratio <70% suggests obstructive ventilatory defect (eg, asthma, bronchiectasis, COPD).

FEV1/FVC ratio ≥70% suggests restrictive ventilatory defect (eg, interstitial lung disease, neuromuscular diseases, obesity, scoliosis).

MNEMONIC

Etiologies of obstructive pulmonary disease—

ABCO Asthma Bronchiectasis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/Cystic fibrosis Obstruction (tracheal or bronchial)

ASTHMA

Reversible airway obstruction secondary to bronchial hyperreactivity, airway inflammation, mucus plugging, and smooth muscle hypertrophy. Most often diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood but can present later.

KEY FACT

Beware—all that wheezes is not asthma! Other conditions that can cause wheezing are foreign body inhalation, left heart failure (cardiac wheezing), and COPD (ie, anything causing airway constriction).

History/PE Usually presents with dry cough, episodic wheezing, dyspnea, and/or chest tightness, often

episodic wheezing;.dyspnea, morning (| inspiration/expiration and hyperresonance. sounds, cyanosis, | arterial blood [Paco,]),

worsening at night or in early morning

PE: Wheezing, prolonged expiration (↓ inspiration/expiration ratio), increased accessory muscle use, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hyperresonance.

Signs of severe disease: ↓ breath sounds, cyanosis, ↓ O2 saturation, hypercapnia (↑ partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood [PaCO2]), and pulsus paradoxus

KEY FACT

Asthma should be suspected in children with multiple episodes of croup and upper respiratory tract infections associated with dyspnea. Children with eczema are more likely to develop asthma or allergic rhinitis than those without eczema.

KEY FACT

Asthma triggers include allergens, upper respiratory infections (URIs), cold air, exercise, drugs (eg, aspirin, NSAIDs, β-blockers), and stress in both adults and children.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: Samter triad has three clinical features: asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and intolerance to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; most commonly upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms but occasionally also rash, abdominal pain, or vomiting). Pseudoallergic reaction (not IgE mediated)

Methacholine challenge: Tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness; useful when PFTs are normal but asthma is still suspected. The methacholine challenge is considered positive with ≥20% decrease in FEV1. The test is sensitive but not specific.

Arterial blood gas (ABG):

Early exacerbation: Respiratory alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation (↓ PaCO2, ↑ pH).

Late/severe exacerbation (impending respiratory failure): Respiratory muscle fatigue results in respiratory acidosis caused by inability to ventilate (normalizing PaCO2, normalizing pH, ↓ partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood [PaO2]).

X-ray of the chest (CXR): Normal appearance to hyperinflation with flattening of the diaphragm.

KEY FACT

Summary of asthma medications: PRN (as needed) medications—short-acting bronchodilators (eg, albuterol) Long-term medications—inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β2-agonists (eg, salmeterol), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), leukotriene antagonists (eg, montelukast), and PO (by mouth) corticosteroids.

MNEMONIC

Medications for asthma exacerbations— ASTHMA Albuterol (bronchodilator) Steroids (anti-inflammatory) Theophylline (rarely used bronchodilator due to narrow therapeutic index) Humidified O2 (in hypoxemic patients) Magnesium (bronchodilator used in severe exacerbations) Anticholinergics (bronchodilator)

Treatment

In general, avoidance of allergens or any potential triggers. See Tables 2.14-2 and 2.14-3 for asthma medications and management guidelines.

Before stepping up or down, the physician should check inhaler technique, patient adherence, and environmental exposures and confirm that symptoms are due to asthma. *Alternate track: As an alternative, SABA can be taken as needed as a reliever mediation. This can be combined with low-dose ICS as needed (step 1), or low-dose ICS maintenance therapy can be started (step 2). All other add-on medications (steps 3-5) are the same as the preferred track.
======================================
Acute exacerbation:

O2, SABA (albuterol is first-line), systemic glucocorticoids. SABA/ipratropium and magnesium can be used in severe exacerbations. Ipratropium should not be used alone in asthma treatment.

The physician should consider intubation in severe cases (cyanosis, inability to maintain respiratory effort, altered mental status) or in patients with a PaCO2 >50 mm Hg or PaO2 <50 mm Hg.

Initiation and adjustment of maintenance therapy:

Initiation of treatment is determined by asthma symptom severity at baseline. Therapy may include a combination of controller medications (which prevent exacerbations, eg, salmeterol + ICS) and reliever medications (which treat exacerbations acutely, eg, albuterol). Certain medications (formoterol + ICS) have both controller and reliever effects.

Controller therapy may be stepped up or down in intensity according to patient’s needs.

KEY FACT

Adults and adolescents diagnosed with asthma, even mild forms, should use ICSs to control airway inflammation. Benefits of low-dose ICSs include improved lung function and reductions in symptoms, severe exacerbations, mortality, and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

BRONCHIECTASIS

A disease caused by recurrent cycles of infection and inflammation in the bronchi/bronchioles that leads to fibrosis, remodeling, and permanent dilation of bronchi (see Fig. 2.14-3).

FIGURE 2.14-3. Bronchiectasis. CT of the chest demonstrates markedly dilated and thick- walled airways (arrows) consistent with bronchiectasis in this cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

History/PE Presents with chronic productive cough accompanied by frequent bouts of yellow or green

sputum production, dyspnea, and possible hemoptysis and halitosis

Associated with a history of cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary infections (eg, Pseudomonas, atypical mycobacteria), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, hypersensitivity, immunodeficiency, localized airway obstruction, aspiration, autoimmune disease, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

PE: Reveals rales, wheezes, rhonchi, purulent mucus, and occasional hemoptysis

Diagnosis CXR: Shows ↑ bronchovascular markings and tram lines (parallel lines outlining dilated

bronchi as a result of peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis).

Most accurate test: High-resolution CT. Dilated airways (ie, larger than pulmonary arteries) and ballooned cysts are seen at the end of the bronchus (mostly lower lobes).

Spirometry/PFTs: Obstructive pattern with ↓ FEV1/FVC ratio. Additional tests to identify underlying etiology: Depends on clinical suspicion. Sputum microscopy and culture may reveal chronic infection (eg, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, tuberculosis) or suggest allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ie, presence of eosinophils or hyphae). α1-Antitrypsin levels can rule out deficiency. Sweat chloride and/or genetic testing for CFTR mutations may suggest CF. Rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), or other screening tests for autoimmune disease may also be considered.

======================================
Q

A 10-year-old child with a history of asthma on daily fluticasone has been using an albuterol inhaler once a day as needed for several weeks. What changes should be made to the current regimen?

Treatment Medications: Antibiotics for exacerbations (↓ bacterial load and airway/systematic

inflammatory mediators)

Empiric therapy: Respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) Tailoring of treatment to sputum culture results, if available Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): Systemic glucocorticoids and

antifungals (voriconazole, itraconazole)

Lifestyle: Bronchopulmonary hygiene (cough promotion, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy).

Surgery: Consideration of lobectomy for localized disease or lung transplantation for severe disease.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

A disease with ↓ lung function associated with airflow obstruction. Can be divided into two major subtypes: Chronic bronchitis: Productive cough for >3 months per year for 2 consecutive years

(clinical diagnosis)

Emphysema: Destruction and dilation of structures distal to the terminal bronchioles (pathologic diagnosis) that may be secondary to smoking (centrilobular) or to α1- antitrypsin deficiency (panlobular)

KEY FACT

In patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnia, excess supplemental oxygen can decrease ventilatory drive, resulting in worsening hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis.

KEY FACT

Consider α1-antitrypsin deficiency in a patient who is <60 years of age, has a family history of COPD, has minimal or no smoking history, has liver disease, and has basilar-predominant COPD.

History/PE Symptoms are minimal or nonspecific until the disease is advanced. The clinical spectrum is shown in Table 2.14-4 (most patients are a combination of the two

phenotypes).

Emphysema and Chronic APPEARANCE Thin, wasted and ance with lips, minimal

Symptoms: Classic barrel chest, use of accessory chest muscles, jugular vein distention (JVD), end-expiratory wheezing, dyspnea on exertion, and muffled breath sounds.

ABGs: Hypoxemia with acute or chronic respiratory acidosis (↑ PaCO2). Gram stain and sputum culture: Considered if bacterial infection is suspected (eg, fever,

productive cough, new infiltrate on CXR).
======================================
KEY FACT

Supplemental O2 and smoking cessation are the only interventions proven to improve survival in patients with COPD.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Spirometry (PFTs); obstructive pattern that is nonreversible with SABA.

FEV1/FVC <70%, ↓ FEV1, normal/↓ FVC, ↑ RV and TLC; minimal (<12%) to no change in FEV1 with SABA (albuterol)

↓ DLCO (emphysema or late-stage COPD); normal DLCO (chronic bronchitis)

This child has moderate persistent asthma with daily symptoms. The patient will benefit from an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist, such as salmeterol, for prevention of symptoms.

CXR: Hyperinflated lungs, ↓ lung markings with flat diaphragms, and a thin-appearing heart and mediastinum are sometimes seen. Parenchymal bullae or subpleural blebs are also seen (see Fig. 2.14-4).

FIGURE 2.14-4. COPD. (A) Posteroanterior (PA) and (B) lateral radiographs of a patient with emphysema show hyperinflation with large lung volumes, flattening of the diaphragm, and minimal peripheral vascular markings. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

KEY FACT

Treatments for acute asthma and COPD exacerbations both involve β2-agonists and corticosteroids. During an acute COPD exacerbation, antibiotics may also be given. During an acute asthma exacerbation, magnesium can be given.

RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE

Characterized by a loss of lung compliance, restrictive lung diseases result in ↑ lung stiffness and ↓ lung expansion. Table 2.14-1 and Figure 2.14-2 contrast obstructive with restrictive lung disease. The etiologies of restrictive lung disease are shown in the AIN’T mnemonic.

INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE

MNEMONIC

Etiology of restrictive lung disease— If the lungs AIN’T compliant Alveolar (edema, hemorrhage, pus) Interstitial lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usual insterstitial pneumonia,

nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis with interstitial pneumonia)

Neuromuscular (myasthenia, phrenic nerve palsy, myopathy) Thoracic wall (kyphoscoliosis, obesity, ascites, pregnancy, ankylosing spondylitis)

A heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the interstitium. In advanced disease, cystic spaces can develop in the lung periphery, a development that leads to the characteristic “honeycomb” pattern seen on CT (see Fig. 2.14- 6A). Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is also called diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD).

Subgroups of ILD: Exposure related: Asbestosis, silicosis, berylliosis, coal worker’s pneumoconiosis,

medications (eg, amiodarone, bleomycin), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, radiation-induced injury

disease or connective sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, fibrosis (IPF), cryptogenic

ILD associated with systemic disease or connective tissue diseases:

Polymyositis/dermatomyositis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, vasculitis, scleroderma (CREST syndrome)

Idiopathic: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia
======================================
KEY FACT

Medications and interventions that can cause or contribute to ILD include amiodarone, busulfan, nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, methotrexate, radiation, and long-term high O2 concentration (eg, ventilators).

History/PE Presents with shallow, rapid breathing; progressive dyspnea with exertion; and a chronic

nonproductive cough

May have cyanosis, inspiratory squeaks, fine or “Velcro-like” crackles, clubbing, or right heart failure

Diagnosis Best initial test: CXR; reticular, nodular, or ground-glass pattern Next best step: If CXR is suspicious for ILD, then high-resolution CT; CT shows

“honeycomb” pattern in severe disease

PFTs: Restrictive pattern. Normal/↑ FEV1/FVC, ↓ FVC, ↓ FEV1, ↓ TLC, ↓ FVC, ↓ DLCO If systemic disease is suspected as the cause, the physician can consider serologic testing (eg, ANA, anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP], creatine kinase [CK], aldolase, anti-Jo1, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA], antitopoisomerase, anti–double-

stranded [ds]DNA).

Most accurate test: Surgical biopsy. This is not recommended if CT findings are characteristic (see Fig. 2.14-6A). In IPF and rheumatologic disease, a surgical biopsy is only performed when the diagnosis is uncertain.

======================================
CRYPTOGENIC ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA

Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is a form of diffuse ILD. “Cryptogenic” refers to the idiopathic nature of the condition. “Organizing pneumonia” refers to the typical pathologic appearance of the condition wherein buds of granulation tissue form in distal air spaces (alveoli and bronchiolar lumen [bronchiolitis obliterans]). These findings are not specific to a disease, but just a type of inflammatory process.

History/PE Typically presents with subacute fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, anorexia,

and malaise that have failed to respond to antibiotic therapy.

Diagnosis Other causes such as infection or autoimmune disease must be excluded. Radiographic findings on CXR or CT include bilateral, peripheral patchy opacities that

may migrate.

PFTs show a restrictive defect with diffusion impairment. Pathologic examination of biopsy specimens is diagnostic (generally surgical biopsy is

required, although transbronchial biopsy can be attempted).

Treatment Treatment with corticosteroids results in dramatic clinical and radiologic response. Relapse is common on tapering steroids. Overall, prognosis is excellent.

SYSTEMIC SARCOIDOSIS

A multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by infiltration of noncaseating granulomas. In the United States, more commonly found in females (although it occurs in males too) of African or Northern European descent. Most often arises in the third or fourth decade of life.

with fever, cough, nodosum, bilateral hilar with good prognosis

History/PE Systemic sarcoidosis can present with fever, cough, dyspnea, malaise, weight loss, or

arthritis.

Lofgren syndrome: Erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar adenopathy, migratory polyarthralgia, and fever; associated with good prognosis

Q

A 25-year-old Black woman presents to the physician’s office with painful bumps on her shins, weight loss, and cough. Examination reveals a prominent 1-cm right axillary lymph node. What is the next best step for diagnosis?

Extrapulmonary manifestations can involve the following organs: liver, eyes (uveitis), skin (erythema nodosum, violaceous skin plaques), central nervous system (CNS), heart (third- degree heart block, arrhythmias), and kidneys.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CXR shows bilateral hilar adenopathy and reticular opacities (upper lobe predominant). Figure 2.14-7 illustrates CXR findings of sarcoidosis. High-resolution CT is usually done following suspicious CXR.

FIGURE 2.14-7. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (arrows) in a patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Next best step: If CXR/CT is suspicious, then bronchoscopic biopsy. Noncaseating granulomas are diagnostic in the presence of a compatible clinical picture with exclusion of other diseases.

KEY FACT

Lofgren syndrome is a type of sarcoidosis with the following triad: arthritis, erythema nodosum, and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Associated with a good prognosis.

HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS

Alveolar thickening and noncaseating granulomas secondary to environmental exposure (eg, farmer’s lung seen in farmers and cattle workers due to chronic inhalation of mold that grows on hay and grain or pigeon breeder’s disease due to chronic inhalation of particles from feathers or bird droppings)

History/PE Acute: Dyspnea, fever, malaise, shivering, and cough starting 4 to 6 hours after exposure;

the physician should gather a job/travel history to determine exposure

Chronic: Presents with progressive dyspnea; physical examination reveals fine bilateral rales

Diagnosis Appearance on CXR/CT is variable, but upper lobe fibrosis is a common feature of chronic disease.

Treatment The patient should avoid ongoing exposure to inciting agents; the physician should prescribe corticosteroids to ↓ chronic inflammation.

EOSINOPHILIC PULMONARY SYNDROMES

A diverse group of disorders characterized by eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates and abnormal peripheral blood eosinophilia. Includes ABPA, Loffler syndrome, acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangitis, and drug-induced disorders (eg, NSAIDs, nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides).
======================================
History/PE Presents with dyspnea, cough, potentially blood-tinged sputum, and/or fever.

Diagnosis Complete blood cell count (CBC): May reveal peripheral eosinophilia (≥500

eosinophils/uL)

CXR: Shows pulmonary infiltrates Bronchoalveolar lavage: ↑ eosinophils (>25%)

KEY FACT

Loffler syndrome is a form of eosinophilic pulmonary disease characterized by absent or mild respiratory symptoms (most often dry cough), fleeting migratory pulmonary opacities, and peripheral blood eosinophilia.

Treatment Removal of the extrinsic cause or treatment of underlying infection (eg, helminths) if identified. Corticosteroid treatment may be used.

ALLERGIC BRONCHOPULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS

ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction of airways to colonization by Aspergillus. As a result of recurrent inflammation, obstruction, and mucous secretions, bronchiectasis and fibrosis develop. Early treatment may prevent progression to bronchiectasis or pulmonary fibrosis.

History/PE Patients often have underlying asthma or CF, and they present with recurrent fever, bronchial obstruction, brownish expectoration, and hemoptysis.

antibodies or positive Aspergillus skin prick test). Negative results rule out aspergillosis. Patients sensitized to Aspergillus should undergo further laboratory testing for total serum

IgE, Aspergillus precipitins, and eosinophil counts (generally >500 cells/uL).

Sputum may have eosinophil-rich plugs and Charcot-Leyden crystals. Culture of sputum may grow Aspergillus.

Imaging with CT of chest or a CXR may show evidence of bronchiectasis.

Treatment Systemic glucocorticoids (prednisone) and antifungal therapy (itraconazole or

voriconazole) may be used.

Optimization of asthma treatment with possible addition of biologic agents (eg, omalizumab). Patients with CF may also benefit from omalizumab.

Patients should reduce Aspergillus exposure at home or work.

Complications Complications include acute/chronic invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and aspergilloma.
======================================
ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE

HYPOXEMIA

Hypoxemia is a below normal arterial oxygen level, normally defined as PaO2 <60 mm Hg. Causes include ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, right-to-left shunt, hypoventilation, low inspired O2 content (high altitudes), and diffusion impairment.

History/PE Findings depend on the etiology. ↓ saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2), cyanosis, tachypnea, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain (caused by wheezing, coughing), and altered mental status may be seen.

Diagnosis Best initial test: ABGs; exhibition of ↓ PaO2. Calculate the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen

gradient:150 − (Paco2/0.8) − PaO2. (Note: Presumes Patm is 760 mm Hg at sea level, fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] is 0.21).

CXR: To evaluate for an infiltrative process (eg, pneumonia), atelectasis, a large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax and to assess for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An ↑ A-a gradient suggests shunt, V/Q mismatch, or diffusion impairment. Figure 2.14-8 summarizes the approach toward patients who have hypoxemia.

KEY FACT

If the problem is hypoventilation or low inspired oxygen, the A-a gradient will be normal. If the problem is ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch or shunting, the A-a gradient will increase.

Treatment Address the underlying etiology. Administer O2 before initiating evaluation. ↑ oxygenation parameters if the patient is on mechanical ventilation (see Table 2.14-7).

ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

Respiratory failure with refractory hypoxemia, ↓ lung compliance, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with a PaO2/FiO2 ≤300. Pathogenesis is thought to be dependent on endothelial injury.

Common triggers are as follows: Sepsis (most common), severe pulmonary infection (pneumonias), aspiration, blood transfusions, inhaled/ingested toxins, drowning, and trauma.

Overall mortality is 30% to 40%.

History/PE Presents with acute-onset (12–48 hours) tachypnea, dyspnea, and tachycardia ± fever,

cyanosis, labored breathing, diffuse high-pitched rales, and hypoxemia in the setting of one of the systemic inflammatory causes or exposure.

Additional findings are as follows:

Phase 1 (acute injury): Normal physical examination; possible respiratory alkalosis Phase 2 (6–48 hours): Hyperventilation, hypocapnia, widening A-a gradient Phase 3: Acute respiratory failure, tachypnea, dyspnea, ↓ lung compliance, scattered

rales, diffuse chest opacities on CXR (see Fig. 2.14-9)

Phase 4: Severe hypoxemia unresponsive to therapy; ↑ intrapulmonary shunting; metabolic and respiratory acidosis

Diagnosis The criteria for an ARDS diagnosis (according to the Berlin definition) are as follows: Acute onset (<1 week) of respiratory distress. CXR: Bilateral alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema on CXR <24 hours after trauma may suggest pulmonary contusion instead of ARDS; features of pulmonary contusions are shown in Figure 2.14-10.

A PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤300 with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ≥5 cm H2O.

Respiratory failure not completely explained by heart failure.

Treatment Treat the underlying disease and maintain adequate perfusion to prevent end-organ

damage.

Prone positioning in select patients with severe ARDS (eg, severe ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 ratio <150 mm Hg and FiO2 ≥0.6 and PEEP ≥5 cm H2O) reduces mortality.

Use mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes (6 cc/kg of ideal body weight) to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury by overdistention of alveoli.

Use PEEP to recruit collapsed alveoli and titrate PEEP and FiO2 to achieve adequate

oxygenation. To ↑ PaO2, ↑ PEEP. Keep FiO2 ≤60% (0.6), if possible, to prevent oxygen toxicity.

Goal oxygenation is PaO2 >55 mm Hg or SpO2 >88%. Extubation may be attempted if:

The cause of respiratory failure has improved. Ventilator support required is minimal (low PEEP, low pressure support). Oxygen supplementation is easily accomplished without the support of PEEP or other

adjuvant treatments.

Patient passes a spontaneous breathing trial.
======================================
MECHANICAL VENTILATION

Mechanical ventilation is the process by which gas is moved to and from the lungs by an external device to artificially support their functions. It may be invasive (via tracheostomy, endotracheal tube) or noninvasive (via mask).

Indications For Invasive Mechanical Ventilation Indications for mechanical ventilation include but are not limited to: Inadequate oxygenation (acute hypoxemia, eg, atelectasis, small airway/parenchymal

disease)

Inadequate ventilation (acute hypercapnia, eg, flail chest or inadequate ventilation) Inability to maintain airway (eg, trauma, intoxication, postictal state) Hemodynamic instability

KEY FACT

In flail chest, multiple rib fractures result in a floppy segment that moves paradoxically due to negative intrathoracic pressure on inspiration. By increasing positive intrathoracic pressure, positive-pressure ventilation improves oxygenation and causes the flail segment to move normally.

Ventilator Mechanics Table 2.14-8 depicts changes in lung pressures during ventilation. Table 2.14-9 shows abnormal ventilator waveforms and explains the significance.

pulmonary disease [COPD]) or 6 mL/kg in ARDS (ie, restrictive disease).

The rate is generally set lower for obstructive diseases as opposed to ARDS (eg, 10– 14/min in obstructive lung disease and 14–18/min in ARDS; however, specific settings vary based on disease process and ABG).

Fio2 is initially started at 100% and titrated down to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 88% to 95% or Pao2 55 to 80 mm Hg. Ideally, FiO2 is reduced to ≤60% to prevent oxygen toxicity.

Use ARDSnet PEEP/FiO2 table for guidnace on PEEP for ARDS management. This is to prevent barotrauma. For obstructive disease, start with PEEP of 0 to 5 cm H2O.

I:E ratio: In obstructive lung disease, the inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio is higher (I:E >1:3) than with ARDS (I:E > 1:1.5). This is needed because the lungs take more time to effectively empty due to obstructed airways.

After initiation of ventilation, changes in settings should be based on ABGs. Refer to Table 2.14-10.

======================================
Complications of Mechanical Ventilation Ventilation is associated with multiple complications, including ventilator-associated lung injury and hypotension.

Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury Acute lung injury inflicted by mechanical ventilation that may result in increased mortality and morbidity. Some mechanisms are described next: Volutrauma: Caused by excessive stretch by high tidal volume. This can be prevented by

are described next: stretch by high tidal In ARDS, a barotrauma. opening and closing of

using lower tidal volumes.

Barotrauma: Due to high pressures. In ARDS, a lung-protective strategy (plateau pressure <30 cmH2O) minimizes barotrauma.

Atelectrauma: Due to cyclical opening and closing of alveoli. This can be minimized with ↑ PEEP.

Biotrauma: Due to inflammatory mediators possibly caused by other forms of trauma. Oxygen effect: Possibility for high FiO2 to cause lung damage. This is less likely at FiO2

<0.6.

KEY FACT

In left heart failure, PEEP is beneficial, as ↑ intrathoracic pressure causes ↓ preload and ↓ afterload. On the other hand, ↑ PEEP worsens right heart failure (↑ increased intrathoracic and ↑ pulmonary vascular pressures).

KEY FACT

For acute brain injury (stroke) target an SpO2 of 94% to 98% or a PaO2 of 80 to 100 mm Hg to help the brain oxygenate. Both very high PEEP and hypoxemia can increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and cause cerebral ischemia.

Acute Hypotension Tension pneumothorax: Acute hypotension with tachycardia and sudden increase in peak

inspiratory pressure is suggestive of tension pneumothorax. CXR should be ordered. Decreased venous return: High levels of PEEP cause increased intrathoracic pressure

Decreased venous return: High levels of PEEP cause increased intrathoracic pressure and decreased venous return. This may cause or exacerbate hypotension.

and decreased venous return. This may cause or exacerbate hypotension. Sedatives and opioids used in ventilated patients may cause hypotension.

CORONAVIRUSES AND COVID-19

RNA viruses that can infect animals and humans. Global outbreaks of severe disease have been caused by coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak of 2012. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019, and this led to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cases were reported in Wuhan, China. A detailed discussion of COVID-19 follows.

Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of COVID-19 involves an exaggerated inflammatory response to viral infection (cytokine storm syndrome [CSS]). CSS may result in fever, multiorgan dysfunction, cardiac and renal injury, and ARDS.
======================================
Q

care unit (ICU) is after intubation and What adjustments,

A 25-year-old man in the intensive care unit (ICU) is intubated, following an acute asthma exacerbation. A repeat ABG is sent after intubation and shows a pH of 7.5, a PaCO2 of 33 – of 26 mEq/L. What adjustments, if any, should the physician make mm Hg, and an HCO3 to the ventilator settings?

History/PE The virus is spread by respiratory droplets and has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days

(average of 5 days).

Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe and life- threatening disease.

Patients with mild infection may present with fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion. Anosmia and ageusia (loss of smell and taste, respectively) are common. Additionally, GI symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are also reported with COVID-19.

More serious infections may result in dyspnea, respiratory failure, ARDS, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.

Thromboembolic events (such as pulmonary embolism) may occur.

Diagnosis Most sensitive test: Nucleic acid amplification test ([NAAT] also known as reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) of nasopharyngeal samples. Rapid antigen testing has lower sensitivity; however, point-of-care testing allows for immediate results and communication of advice so patients can isolate and monitor sooner.

CXR may show bilateral opacities. CT may show multifocal, bilateral, peripheral ground- glass opacities (often affecting the posterior portion of the lower lobes), consolidation, and

air bronchograms (Fig. 2.14-11).

FIGURE 2.14-11. CT angiogram of chest in COVID-19 pneumonia shows dense right lower lobe and left lower lobe opacities and air bronchograms. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com, courtesy of Dr. Arjun Iyer.)

Laboratory findings: Abnormal blood counts (eg, lymphopenia [most common laboratory finding], thrombocytopenia), coagulation studies (eg, ↑ D-dimer), inflammatory markers (eg, ↑ C-reactive protein [CRP]), and other biochemical tests (eg, ↑ lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ↑ alanine aminotransferase [ALT], ↑ aspartate aminotransferase [AST], ↑ creatinine) are commonly seen in hospitalized patients.

Treatment Mild cases can be managed at home with isolation, monitoring, and symptomatic treatment (eg, antipyretics, analgesics, antitussives, hydration). Patients with mild to moderate COVID- 19 at high risk for progression to severe disease may be treated with neutralizing antibodies or antivirals. For severe cases, inpatient care is needed.

Prevention Personal preventive strategies: Social distancing (maintaining distance of 6 feet,

avoiding crowds), mask wearing, handwashing, use of hand sanitizer, reducing hand-to- face contact, good ventilation.

Strategies by healthcare personnel: Personal protective equipment ([PPE], gowns, gloves, eye protection) while caring for patients with COVID-19. For aerosol-generating procedures, an N95 mask must be used.

Vaccines: Reduce severity of illness.

This patient has an uncompensated respiratory alkalosis caused by ↑ ventilation. To ↓ ventilation, tidal volume can be ↓ or respiratory rate can be slowed; however, reducing the tidal volume can trigger an ↑ in ventilatory rate, exacerbating the situation.

PULMONARY VASCULAR DISEASE

A

PULMONARY HYPERTENSION/COR PULMONALE

Pulmonary hypertension (PH): Elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (>20 mm Hg) at rest

Classified into the following groups:

Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) Group 2: ↑ pulmonary venous pressure from left-sided heart disease Group 3: Hypoxic vasoconstriction secondary to chronic lung disease Group 4: Chronic thromboembolic disease Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension with a multifactorial etiology

Core pulmonale (group 3): Alteration in structure and function of the right ventricle (RV) of the heart caused by a primary disorder of the respiratory system. Right-sided heart failure can occur in severe cases.

History/PE Presents with dyspnea, syncope on exertion, fatigue, lethargy, chest pain, and/or symptoms

of right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) (edema, abdominal distention, JVD)

Hx: COPD, ILD, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, emphysema, and pulmonary embolism PE: Loud, palpable S2 (often split), a flow murmur, an S4, or a parasternal heave; patient

KEY FACT

Other etiologies of embolic disease include postpartum status (amniotic fluid emboli), fracture (fat emboli), cardiac surgery (air emboli), and endovascular procedure (cholesterol emboli).

Diagnosis Best initial test: Echocardiogram that estimates pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and

assesses RV function

CXR: Shows enlargement of central pulmonary arteries with rapid tapering of the distal vessels (pruning)

ECG: Demonstrates right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) Diagnostic test of choice: Right heart catheterization; mean pulmonary artery pressure

>20 mm Hg (normal: 8–20 mm Hg)

Treatment Treat underlying disease. Supportive therapy: Supplemental O2, diuretics; some patients may also benefit from

exercise therapy

Consider digoxin and anticoagulation in patients with underlying left ventricle systolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation

Group 1 (primary PAH): Prostanoids (eg, beraprost, epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil), endothelin receptor antagonists (eg, ambrisentan, bosentan, and macitentan), and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) can be added to improve hemodynamics and increase exercise tolerance. Some patients have

vasoreactivity and respond well to calcium channel blockers

Group 4 (thromboembolic disease): Surgical thromboendarterectomy; anticoagulation is recommended for everyone; balloon pulmonary angioplasty and riociguat are the alternatives for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
======================================
PULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM

An occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature by a blood clot. Ninety-five percent of emboli originate from deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the deep leg veins (eg, femoral vein). May lead to pulmonary infarction, right heart failure, and hypoxemia.

History/PE Factors predisposing to thromboembolism are summarized by the Virchow triad (see Table

2.14-11).

A V/Q scan is sensitive for pulmonary embolism but not specific, especially if there is underlying lung disease.

ABGs: Respiratory alkalosis caused by hyperventilation (↓ PaO2 [<80 mm Hg], ↓ PaCO2). CXR: May appear normal or show atelectasis, pleural effusion, Hampton hump (a wedge- shaped infarct), or Westermark sign (oligemia/collapse of vessels seen distal to pulmonary embolism).

ECG: Most commonly reveals sinus tachycardia. The classic triad of S1Q3T3 is rare (acute right heart strain with an S wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III).

Lower extremity venous ultrasound: Specific and sensitive for DVT, which may be the cause of the pulmonary embolism.

(Modified with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Acute: Unfractionated heparin, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), subcutaneous fondaparinux, or direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, apixaban). In patients with high probability of pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation should be given before confirmatory testing. Patients with renal failure require unfractionated heparin or apixaban.

Chronic: LMWH, direct oral anticoagulants (preferred), or warfarin (goal for international normalized ratio [INR] = 2–3). Use LMWH in pregnancy (warfarin is contraindicated). Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter: Indicated in patients with a documented lower extremity DVT/pulmonary embolism if anticoagulation is contraindicated or if patients experience recurrent emboli while on therapeutic doses of anticoagulation.

Thrombolysis: Indicated in cases of massive pulmonary embolism causing right heart failure and hemodynamic instability (saddle pulmonary embolism).

DVT prophylaxis: Treatment for all immobile patients. The physician should prescribe subcutaneous heparin or low-dose LMWH, early ambulation (most effective), and intermittent compression of the lower extremities (less effective).

If a nodule has fat or calcifications characteristic of a benign lesion (eg, hamartoma, granuloma), no further evaluation is required.

If a nodule does not have characteristics of a benign lesion, the next step is to review the medical record for a previous CT (if available).

If the nodule is old and the size is stable (>2 years), no further evaluation is required. If the nodule is new, increasing in size, or no prior CT scans are available, then determine

risk for malignancy.

Low risk: Serial CT scans.

Intermediate risk: Further investigation required with biopsy or positron emission tomography (PET).

A 25-year-old woman presents with dyspnea, chest pain, and leg pain. She takes birth control pills regularly. She returned from Asia 3 days ago. What is the next step?

History/PE Presentation: Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, wheezing, pneumonia, chest pain, weight

loss, and possible abnormalities on respiratory exam (crackles, atelectasis)

The next step is to treat with a heparin bolus or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). When there is high clinical suspicion (birth control, history of long flight, multiple symptoms) for a DVT/PE, one should treat first and follow with imaging (CT angiogram). With patients who have lower clinical suspicion, imaging is warranted first before treatment.

Superior sulcus tumors (Pancoast tumors): Tumor at the apex of the lung, adjacent to the subclavian vessels; presentation is dependent on which of the following structures are compressed:

Diagnosis Best initial test: CXR or CT of the chest If initial test raises suspicion for malignancy, the physician should obtain a tissue sample

next

Most accurate tests: Fine-needle aspiration (CT guided) for peripheral lesions and

bronchoscopy (biopsy or brushing) for central lesions Once diagnosis established, PET/CT is done for staging.

Treatment Treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) varies according to the stage. Early-stage diseases require surgery with or without neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy).

Given prior to surgery, neoadjuvant therapy aims to decrease the size of a tumor. Adjuvant

therapy is given right after surgery to decrease chances for residual disease.

For advanced-stage disease, systemic therapy is the best recommended approach. For

some inoperable tumours (Stage III) or in patients unfit for surgery, chemotherapy and radiation alone may sometimes be curative. The regimens of systemic therapies differ according to the histology, but the principles remain the same.

Q

A 65-year-old patient with a 30-pack-year history presents with a 2-week history of facial swelling. CT imaging reveals a hilar mass and biopsy reveals SCLC. What is the next step in treatment?

Types of systemic therapies include: Chemotherapy: Aims to kill rapidly dividing cells. It is an imprecise way of preventing cancer growth. However, chemotherapy prevents growth of not only cancer cells but also normal cells of the GI tract and others. It can therefore cause adverse events such as diarrhea, nausea, and hair loss.

Targeted therapy: Aims to block cancer cells harboring a driver mutation (eg, EGFR mutation or ALK translocation).

immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, anti-programmed death [PD]-1 inhibitors, anti– programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] inhibitors, and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte– associated antigen 4 [anti-CTLA-4]). PD-1 and CTLA4 are checkpoint regulators present on immune cells. When PD-1 is bound to its ligands (present on the cancer cells), it prevents activation of the immune system.

Note: Epiglottitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and bronchiolitis are mostly seen in infants— please refer to the Pediatrics chapter for a discussion of these entities.

PNEUMONIA

Bacterial, fungal, or viral infection of the parenchyma of the lung.

The mainstay of therapy for SCLC is chemotherapy, which yields high rates of response. It is the next step in treatment.

History/PE Living conditions and social history in the weeks preceding presentation, comorbidities, and history of hospitalizations can all give important clues to determine the most likely pathogens. Classic presentation: Acute onset of fever, productive cough (purulent yellow-green

sputum or hemoptysis), dyspnea, night sweats, and pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms may be subtle in immunocompromised/older adult patients.

Atypical presentations (gradual onset, dry cough, headaches, myalgias, sore throat, GI symptoms) can be seen with viral pneumonias and infections with fastidious organisms
======================================
A

(Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, C pneumoniae).

Lung examination may show ↓ or bronchial breath sounds, rales, wheezing, dullness to percussion, egophony, and/or tactile fremitus.

Diagnosis The diagnosis of pneumonia is made in the setting of a suspicious clinical context and compatible chest imaging findings. CXR is the best initial diagnostic test (see figure 2.14-17). If CXR does not reveal clear infiltrate but suspicion for pneumonia is high, a noncontrast CT of the chest can be obtained for more detailed visualization of the lung parenchyma.

Posteroanterior (A) and breath show a left lower

Streptococcus pneumoniae was confirmed by sputum Gram stain and culture. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Severity of illness determines best management setting (inpatient vs outpatient) and recommended diagnostic workup. Routine bloodwork (CBC, metabolic panel) should be obtained for all patients.

For patients treated in the outpatient setting, influenza testing can be considered if they are candidates for antiviral treatment with oseltamivir. Otherwise, no additional workup is needed unless there is failure to respond to initial treatment or if there are risk factors for resistant organisms (recent hospitalization, structural lung disease).

For patients treated in the hospital, blood cultures and sputum Gram stain (see Fig. 2.14- 18) and culture are indicated, as well as respiratory viral testing, Legionella testing, and urine streptococcal antigen testing.

Broad- spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation are promptly administered, but the patient continues to be hypotensive. What is the next best step in treatment?

Clinical and social context is important when trying to determine the most likely pathogen in a patient with pneumonia. Common causes of pneumonia are outlined in Tables 2.14-16 and 2.14-17 and illustrated in Figure 2.14-18.

have a higher risk of developing Pseudomonas pneumonia—consider activity against this pathogen by using an antipseudomonal β-lactam (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam) plus either a respiratory fluoroquinolone or a macrolide.
======================================
A summary of the recommended best initial treatment for pneumonia is given in Table 2.14-18.

KEY FACT

The pneumococcal vaccine should be given to all children and to patients >65 years of age. Other indications for pneumococcal vaccine include chronic heart/lung/liver disease, chronic renal failure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, asplenia, immunocompromise (congenital immunodeficiency, malignancy), asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and cochlear implants.

The next best step in treatment entails administration of vasopressors and ICU admission. This patient is in septic shock, probably secondary to pneumonia. Patients with pneumonia who require vasopressors or mechanical ventilation warrant admission to an ICU.
======================================
INFLUENZA

A highly contagious orthomyxovirus transmitted by droplet nuclei. There are three types of influenza: A, B, and C. Subtypes of influenza A (eg, H5N1, H1N1) are classified based on glycoproteins (hemagglutinin [H] and neuraminidase [N]). Relevant terms are as follows:

A

Antigenic drift: Refers to small, gradual changes in surface proteins through point mutations. These small changes are sufficient to allow the virus to escape immune recognition, accounting for why individuals can be infected with influenza multiple times. Antigenic shift: Describes an acute, major change in the influenza A subtype (significant

In the United States, the typical influenza season begins in November and lasts until April. Yearly vaccination with inactivated influenza virus is currently recommended for all patients ≥6 months of age. Children 6 months to 8 years of age require two doses of the seasonal vaccine if they are receiving the vaccine for the first time. A high-dose flu vaccine is available for people ≥65 years of age or those who are immunocompromised.

History/PE Patients typically present with abrupt onset of fever, myalgia, chills, cough, coryza, and weakness. Older adult patients may have atypical presentations characterized only by confusion.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Rapid influenza test of viral antigens from nasopharyngeal swab. Most accurate test: Diagnosis can be made with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests, viral culture, or PCR assays. Rapid influenza tests have low sensitivity, and influenza is usually a clinical diagnosis. Leukopenia is a common finding.

Leukopenia is a common symptomatic care. zanamivir are most of infection by 1 to

Treatment Analgesics and hydration provide symptomatic care. Antivirals such as oseltamivir or zanamivir are most effective when used within 2 days of

onset and may shorten the duration of infection by 1 to 3 days.

Complications Severe primary viral pneumonia with ARDS, secondary bacterial pneumonia (see “Postviral” in Table 2.14-20), sinusitis, bronchitis, and exacerbation of COPD and asthma can occur.
======================================
ASPERGILLOSIS

A group of diseases caused by Aspergillus, typically Aspergillus fumigatus, through infection by spores. Aspergillus can be seen on silver stain as acutely (<45 degrees) branched septate hyphae.

Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis Hypersensitivity reaction seen in people with asthma or CF. Refer to the Restrictive Lung Disease section of this chapter.

Aspergilloma Typically discovered as an incidental radiographic finding in patients with preexisting lung disease (eg, TB, COPD). Hx/PE: May be asymptomatic or present with hemoptysis. Fever and cough are less

common.

Dx: CXR or CT reveals a solid mass within a preexisting lung cavity (Fig. 2.14-19).

Laboratory tests are typically normal.

Chronic Necrotizing Pulmonary Aspergillosis Rare, antibiotic-resistant pneumonia that occurs in patients with immunosuppression (eg, alcohol use disorder, steroid-dependent COPD). Hx/PE: Fever, cough, hemoptysis, night sweats, fatigue. Tx: Voriconazole (or other triazole); rarely surgical resection can be performed if

localized and severe disease.

Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis Severe, rapidly progressive infection that occurs in profoundly immunosuppressed patients (eg, chemotherapy, transplant). Infection begins in the respiratory tract and then disseminates hematogenously (angioinvasion leading to septic emboli). Hx/PE: Fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea/hypoxemia. Dx: Serum galactomannan assay. If negative but degree of suspicion is high,

bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage sent for galactomannan and Aspergillus PCR or lung biopsy can be considered.

Tx: Voriconazole (or other triazole) in addition to decreasing immunosuppression.
======================================
HISTOPLASMOSIS

Risk factors include HIV/AIDS, spelunking (exploring caves), and exposure to bird or bat excrement, especially in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys (see Fig. 2.14-20).

O Blastomycosis Histoplasmosis BB Coccidiodomycosis

asymptomatic or causes.aflulike symptoms to fulminant lymphadenopathy, indicate disseminated atypical bacterial

extrapulmonary manifestations.

Fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, nonproductive cough, palatal or tongue ulcers, and pancytopenia indicate disseminated infection (most often within 14 days).

The differential diagnosis includes atypical bacterial pneumonia, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, tuberculosis (TB), sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, and lymphoma (see Table 2.14-18).

KEY FACT

Nocardia is a partially acid-fast, gram ⊕, branching rod found in soil that is a common cause of lung and CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the treatment of choice (see Fig. 2.14-22).

Case Rep Med. 2013;2013:368637.)

COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS

A pulmonary fungal infection endemic to the Southwestern United States (Fig. 2.14-20). Can present as an acute or subacute pneumonia or as a flulike illness and may involve extrapulmonary sites, including bone, CNS, and skin (manifestations include erythema

multiforme or erythema nodosum). The incubation period is 1 to 4 weeks after exposure. Pregnant, HIV ⊕ patients, and those of Filipino or African descent are at ↑ risk for disseminated disease.

History/PE Patients present with fever, anorexia, headache, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, arthralgias, and night sweats. Disseminated infection can present with meningitis, bone lesions, and soft tissue abscesses.

Diagnosis Serology is specific but not sensitive during the first 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Repeat testing can increase sensitivity, and the disease can be confirmed with immunodiffusion testing.

PCR assays of respiratory specimens have been developed that are highly sensitive and specific.

The physician should obtain bronchoalveolar lavage and fungal cultures of sputum, wound exudate, or other affected tissue. Cultures are usually only obtained in hospitalized patients or patients with severe disease, and growth can take days to weeks.

Identification of Coccidioides immitis spherules can occur with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain or other special sputum or tissue stains.

CXR findings may be normal or show infiltrates, nodules, cavities, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy, or pleural effusion.

======================================
KEY FACT

Consider coccidioidomycosis in a patient from the Southwestern United States who presents with respiratory infection. Pregnant and HIV ⊕ patients and those of Filipino and African descent are at ↑ risk for disseminated disease.

Treatment Acute: PO fluconazole or itraconazole for mild infection. IV amphotericin B is only for severe or protracted primary pulmonary infection and disseminated disease, followed by PO azole therapy once stable.

Chronic: No treatment needed for asymptomatic chronic pulmonary nodules or cavities. Progressive cavitary or symptomatic disease usually requires surgery plus long-term azole therapy for 8 to12 months.

BLASTOMYCOSIS

A fungal infection endemic to the central and southeastern United States, particularly the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. Hx/PE: Presents similarly to coccidioidomycosis and typically has extrapulmonary

involvement in the bone, prostate, and skin.

Dx: Serologic tests not sensitive enough. Culture is the only way to definitively diagnose, and a sputum smear will show broad-based budding yeast.

Tx: Treat symptomatic patients with itraconazole and consider inpatient treatment with amphotericin B and intensive care unit (ICU) admission if the condition is complicated by

ARDS, meningitis, or other systemic involvement.

MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS

TUBERCULOSIS

Infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Roughly 2 billion people are infected with TB (global prevalence). In the United States, close to 10,000 new TB disease cases are identified per year.

History/PE The physician should identify risk factors for TB in a patient’s history, including history of

travel to and from high-risk nations (particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia and sub- Saharan Africa), homelessness, incarceration, alcohol use disorder, IV drug use, HIV positivity, and employment in healthcare. Pre-existing lung disease, immunosuppression, and advancing age are also risk factors.

Most people who become infected with TB are asymptomatic (latent TB). Symptomatic patients can present as primary or secondary (ie, reactivation of latent) TB.

Most cases of TB are confined to the lungs—presenting signs include cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Extrapulmonary TB (more common in patients with HIV) spreads hematogenously and can affect any organ system.

======================================
KEY FACT

Management of the Mantoux tuberculin skin test is the same for patients regardless of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BGC) vaccination status, but testing with interferon-gamma release assays is preferred for those who have received the BCG vaccine.

disease) is the most accurate test but can take weeks to obtain. A sputum acid-fast stain (see Fig. 2.14-24) can yield rapid preliminary results. It is the best initial test, but it lacks sensitivity. Testing of three specimens, obtained 8 hours apart, is recommended. If stains are positive, NAAT and culture are recommended. If extrapulmonary TB is suspected, samples should be sent from affected sites.

FIGURE 2.14-24. Tuberculosis. Note the red color (“red snappers”) of tubercle bacilli on acid- fast staining. (Reproduced with permission from Milikowski C. Color Atlas of Basic Histopathology. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange; 1997.)

The most common finding among typical hosts is a cavitary infiltrate in the upper lobe on CXR (see Fig. 2.14-25), which may be accompanied by calcification of one or more nearby lymph nodes (Ghon complex).

FIGURE 2.14-25. Pulmonary TB. (A) Right apical opacity with areas of cavitation (arrow) is seen in an older adult patient with reactivation TB. (B) Coned-in view of CXR in a young man with miliary TB shows innumerable 1- to 2-mm pulmonary nodules. (Image A reproduced with permission from Halter JB et al. Hazzard’s Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, 6th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2009. Image B reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Patients with HIV or those with primary TB may show lower lobe infiltrates with or without cavitation.

Multiple fine nodular densities distributed throughout both lungs are typical of miliary TB, which represents hematologic or lymphatic dissemination.

Treatment All cases (both latent and active) must be reported to local and state health departments. Respiratory isolation in a negative-pressure room should be instituted if active TB is suspected, and all healthcare workers in contact with the patient should wear N95 masks. Treatment measures are as follows: Latent disease: For a ⊕ PPD without signs or symptoms of active disease, treatment with rifampin for 4 months or with isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide [INH]) plus either rifampin or rifapentine for 3 months. Alternative regimens include INH for 6 months. Active disease: Directly observed multidrug therapy with a four-drug regimen (INH,

pyrazinamide, rifampin, ethambutol) for 2 months, followed by INH and rifampin for 4 months.

High-yield side effects of TB medications: Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis. INH can cause hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy (consider administering pyridoxine

concurrently to prevent this), and a lupus-like syndrome.

Pyrazinamide can lead to hyperuricemia or hepatitis. Rifampin turns body fluids orange.

These organisms can cause a spectrum of disease, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC): Can cause cavitary lung disease classically in older patients with underlying chronic lung disease (COPD, CF). Disseminated disease is classically seen in people with HIV and a CD4+ cell count <50 µL. Mycobacterium kansasii can also cause cavitary lung disease under similar conditions.

Other mycobacteria (M marinum, M abscessus, M ulcerans, M chelonae) can be isolated

in chronic, nonhealing wounds. Ubiquitous organisms cause pulmonary and disseminated infection in several demographic

groups. The primary pulmonary form occurs in apparently healthy nonsmokers (Lady Windermere syndrome); a secondary pulmonary form affects patients with preexisting pulmonary disease such as COPD, TB, or CF. Disseminated infection occurs in AIDS patients with a CD4+ cell count <50/mm3 who are not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

History/PE Disseminated M. avium infection in AIDS is associated with fever, weight loss, diarrhea, and severe anemia in patients who are not on HAART or chemoprophylaxis for MAC.

The next most appropriate step in management involves surgical debridement and amphotericin B. The patient has mucormycosis, a dangerous and aggressive infection found in patients who are diabetic and immunocompromised. Aggressive surgical debridement is warranted.

Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are occasionally seen. Adrenal insufficiency is possible in the setting of adrenal infiltration.

Diagnosis The physician should obtain mycobacterial blood cultures (⊕ in 2–3 weeks). Labs show anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and ↑ serum alkaline phosphatase and LDH. Biopsy of lung, bone marrow, intestine, or liver reveals foamy macrophages with acid-fast

bacilli (AFB). Typical granulomas may be absent in immunocompromised patients.

Treatment Treat with macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) + ethambutol ± rifabutin and consider HAART if the patient is drug-naive. Continue for >12 months and until CD4+ cell count >100/mm3 for >6 months.

Prevention Routine MAC prophylaxis is no longer recommended for HIV patients with CD4+ cell counts <50 and on HAART. Those not on HAART should receive chemoprophylaxis with azithromycin.

Acute respiratory failure with immunosuppressive therapy. Can also present as disseminated disease or as local disease in other organ systems. The differential diagnosis includes TB, viral pneumonia, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis.

Diagnosis Diagnosed by cytology of induced sputum or bronchoscopy specimen with silver stain and

immunofluorescence (see Fig. 2.14-26A). Obtain an ABG to check PaO2.

FIGURE 2.14-26. Pneumocystis pneumonia. (A) Lung tissue stained with silver uncovers folded

(Image A reproduced with permission from Ryan KJ, Ray CG. Sherris Medical Microbiology, 5th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2010. Image B reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

CXR most commonly shows diffuse, bilateral interstitial infiltrates with a ground-glass appearance (see Fig. 2.14-26B, “bat wing” or “butterfly” pattern), but any presentation is possible.

↑ β-d-Glucan and ↑ LDH can be useful but are nonspecific.

Treatment The preferred regimen is high-dose TMP-SMX for 21 days, PO if mild to moderate, and IV if severe. Alternative regimens: Mild to moderate: trimethoprim + dapsone, or primaquine + clindamycin, or atovaquone Severe: pentamidine or primaquine + clindamycin

The physician should use a prednisone taper in patients with moderate to severe hypoxemia (PaO2 <70 mm Hg or an alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ≥35).

======================================
ANTHRAX

Caused by the spore-forming, gram ⊕ bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Infection is an occupational hazard for veterinarians; farmers; and individuals who handle animal wool, hair, hides, or bone meal products. Has been used as a biologic weapon. B anthracis can cause cutaneous (most common), inhalation (most deadly), or GI anthrax. There is no person-to- person spread of anthrax.

History/PE Cutaneous: Presents 1 to 7 days after skin exposure and penetration of spores. The lesion

begins as a pruritic papule that enlarges to form an ulcer surrounded by a satellite bulbus/lesion with an edematous halo and a round, regular, raised edge. Regional lymphadenopathy is also characteristic. The lesion evolves into a black eschar within 7 to 10 days (see Fig. 2.14-27).

FIGURE 2.14-27. Cutaneous anthrax. Black eschar is seen on the forearm. (Reproduced courtesy of James H. Steele, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.)

Inhalational: Presents with fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, or symptoms of pneumonia (1–3 days after exposure), classically caused by hemorrhagic mediastinitis. Patients typically do not have pulmonary infiltrates.

GI: Occurs after the ingestion of poorly cooked, contaminated meat. It can present with dysphagia, nausea/vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Diagnosis Criteria for diagnosis include culture isolation or two nonculture supportive tests (PCR, immunohistochemical staining, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). CXR is the most sensitive test for inhalational disease (shows a widened mediastinum and pleural effusions).

Treatment Best initial treatment: Ciprofloxacin or doxycycline plus one to two additional antibiotics for at least 14 days for inhalational disease or cutaneous disease of the face, head, or neck.

For other cutaneous disease, treat for 7 to 10 days. Postexposure prophylaxis (ciprofloxacin) to prevent inhalation anthrax should be continued for 60 days.
======================================
ACUTE PHARYNGITIS

Viral causes are more common (90% in adults), but it is important to identify streptococcal pharyngitis (group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes). Etiologies are as follows: Bacterial: Group A Streptococcus (GAS), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium

diphtheriae, M pneumoniae

Viral: Rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza virus, coxsackievirus, acute HIV infection

KEY FACT

Early antibiotic treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis can prevent rheumatic fever but not

glomerulonephritis.

History/PE Typical of streptococcal pharyngitis: Fever, sore throat, pharyngeal erythema (see Fig. 2.14-28), tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, soft palate petechiae, headache, vomiting, scarlatiniform rash (indicates scarlet fever)

======================================
Treatment If GAS is suspected, begin empiric antibiotic therapy with penicillin for 10 days.

Cephalosporins, amoxicillin, and azithromycin are alternative options. Symptom relief can be attained with fluids, rest, antipyretics, and saltwater gargles.

Complications Nonsuppurative: Acute rheumatic fever, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis Suppurative: Cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis, sinusitis, otitis media, retropharyngeal

or peritonsillar abscess, and, rarely, thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein (Lemierre syndrome) caused by Fusobacterium, an oral anaerobe

Peritonsillar abscess may present with odynophagia, trismus (“lockjaw”), a muffled “hot potato” voice, unilateral tonsillar enlargement, and erythema, with the uvula and soft palate deviated away from the affected side; culture abscess fluid and localize the abscess via intraoral ultrasound or CT; treat with antibiotics and surgical drainage

KEY FACT

Acute necrotizing mediastinitis is a life-threatening complication of untreated retropharyngeal abscess that presents with fever, chest pain, and dyspnea. It requires urgent surgical drainage to prevent spread to the posterior mediastinum, which may cause lethal pleural and pericardial effusions.

fever should be Streptococcus infection.

KEY FACT

All patients with a history of rheumatic fever should be given routine penicillin prophylaxis to prevent recurrent group A Streptococcus infection.

LUDWIG ANGINA

Rapidly progressive cellulitis of the submandibular space that may cause airway compromise from rapidly expanding edema. Usually caused by polymicrobial infection in the setting of poor oral hygiene. IV broad-spectrum antibiotics and diligent airway management are necessary; surgical drainage is performed if there is abscess formation (uncommon).

ACUTE LYMPHADENITIS

Unilateral and rapid onset (<1 week), commonly caused by S aureus and S pyogenes, typically involving the submandibular lymph nodes. Antibiotics are required if symptoms (fluctuance, fever, cellulitis) are present to prevent abscess formation.
======================================
SINUSITIS

Refers to inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. The maxillary sinuses are most commonly affected. Subtypes include the following: Acute sinusitis (symptoms lasting <1 month): Most commonly associated with viruses,

S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis. Bacterial causes are rare and characterized by purulent nasal discharge, facial or tooth tenderness, hyposmia/anosmia, and symptoms lasting >10 days.

=

Chronic sinusitis (symptoms persisting >3 months): A chronic inflammatory process often caused by obstruction of sinus drainage and ongoing low-grade anaerobic infections.

KEY FACT

Potential complications of sinusitis include meningitis, frontal bone osteomyelitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and abscess formation.

KEY FACT

Ludwig angina is a bilateral cellulitis of the submental, submaxillary, and sublingual spaces that usually results from an infected tooth. It presents with dysphagia; drooling; fever; and a red, warm mouth, and it can lead to death from asphyxiation.

History/PE Presents with fever, facial pain/pressure, headache, nasal congestion, and discharge. Examination may reveal tenderness, erythema, and swelling over the affected area.

Onn

Beware of invasive and life-threatening fungal sinusitis (caused by Mucor and Rhizopus) in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, immune compromise, or neutropenia.

Diagnosis A clinical diagnosis. Culture and imaging are generally not required for acute sinusitis but

may guide the management of chronic cases.

Transillumination shows opacification of the sinuses (low sensitivity). CT is the test of choice for sinus imaging (see Fig. 2.14-29) but is usually necessary only

if symptoms persist after treatment.

FIGURE 2.14-29. Sinusitis. Coronal CT image shows an opacified left maxillary sinus and marked associated bony thickening, consistent with chronic maxillary sinusitis. (Reproduced with permission from Lalwani AK. Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery, 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

Treatment Most cases of acute sinusitis are viral and/or self-limited and are treated with symptomatic therapy (decongestants, antihistamines, nasal saline lavage, pain relief). Acute bacterial sinusitis: The physician should consider either amoxicillin/clavulanate for 10 days or clarithromycin, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP- SMX), a fluoroquinolone, or a second-generation cephalosporin for 10 days.
======================================
Chronic sinusitis:

Antibiotics like those used for acute disease may be prescribed for chronic sinusitis, although a longer course (3–6 weeks) may be necessary.

Adjuvant therapy with intranasal corticosteroids, decongestants, and/or antihistamines may be useful in combating the allergic/inflammatory component of the disease.

Surgical intervention may be required.

HEMOPTYSIS

Hemoptysis is the expectoration of blood from the lower respiratory tract, below the vocal cords, which can be caused by various etiologies. These etiologies can be divided into life- threatening and non-life-threatening hemoptysis. Bleeding from the pulmonary arteries (low- pressure system) is commonly non-life-threatening, whereas bleeding from the bronchial arteries (high-pressure system) may be life-threatening. Hemoptysis is often classified as mild (<30 mL), moderate (31–100 mL), severe (100–600 mL), or massive. Massive hemoptysis is defined by a number of criteria, often ranging from 100 mL to more than 600 mL over 24 hours with respiratory or hemodynamic compromise.

foreign bodies), pulmonary parenchymal disease (infection such as TB, rheumatic and immune disorders such as vasculitis, connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), pulmonary vascular disorders (elevated pulmonary capillary pressure, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, pulmonary embolism), and bleeding disorders.

History/PE Assess for risk factors for specific diseases such as lung cancer in patients with heavy smoking history. Rule out life-threatening hemoptysis, and observe for airway compromise.

Diagnosis Order CXR first and consider CT imaging of the chest if needed to rule out specific

etiologies.

CBC, coagulation studies, urinalysis, rheumatologic workup should be performed as needed.

Treatment In the case of impending airway compromise due to massive hemoptysis, secure the

Management of hemoptysis includes hemodynamic stabilization and treatment of the

underlying cause. In the case of persistent bleeding, bronchoscopic interventions and embolization can be performed to control the bleeding (Fig. 2.14-30).

PLEURAL DISEASE

PLEURAL EFFUSION

An abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. Classified as follows: Transudate: Secondary to ↑ pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or ↓ oncotic

pressure

Exudate: Secondary to ↑ pleural vascular permeability

See Figure 2.14-31 for an algorithm showing etiology of pleural effusion. Table 2.14-20 lists the possible causes of both transudates and exudates.

Diagnosis Best initial test: CXR, blunting of the costophrenic angle. Lateral decubitus view is most

sensitive; it also is used to assess for loculation.

Next step: Thoracentesis. It is indicated for new effusions >1 cm in the decubitus view, except with bilateral effusions and other clinical evidence of CHF.

Using Light criteria can determine if the effusion is transudative or exudative (see Table 2.14-22).

pleurodesis necessitate chest

KEY FACT

Complicated parapneumonic effusions necessitate chest tube drainage.

PNEUMOTHORAX

Collection of air in the pleural space that can lead to pulmonary collapse. Etiologies are the following: Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: Due to rupture of subpleural apical blebs (usually

found in tall, thin, young males).

Secondary pneumothorax: Due to COPD, trauma, infections (TB, P jirovecii), and iatrogenic factors (thoracentesis, subclavian line placement, positive-pressure mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopy with biopsy).

Tension pneumothorax: A pulmonary or chest wall defect acts as a one-way valve, causing air trapping in the pleural space. Buildup of air pushes the mediastinum to the opposite side of the chest, which can obstruct venous return to the heart, leading to hemodynamic instability and even cardiac arrest unless immediately treated.

MNEMONIC
======================================
Presentation of pneumothorax— P-THORAX Pleuritic pain Tracheal deviation

Hyperresonance Onset sudden Reduced breath sounds (and dyspnea) Absent fremitus (asymmetric chest wall) X-ray showing collapse

History/PE Pneumothorax presents with acute onset of unilateral pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. Examination reveals tachypnea, diminished or absent breath sounds, hyperresonance, ↓

tactile fremitus, and JVD secondary to compression of the SVC.

Tension pneumothorax: Presents with respiratory distress, hypoxia, tracheal deviation, and hemodynamic instability.

Diagnosis The diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax should be made clinically. CXR shows the presence of a visceral pleural line and/or lung retraction from the chest wall (best seen in end-expiratory films; see Fig. 2.14-32). In an emergency department (ED) or ICU setting, bedside ultrasound can be used, and it has high sensitivity and specificity.

KEY FACT

Treatment of a tension pneumothorax requires needle decompression first and then chest tube placement.

Treatment Tension pneumothorax: Requires immediate needle decompression (second intercostal

space at the midclavicular line) followed by chest tube placement.

Small pneumothorax (≤2 cm): Observation ± supplemental O2. It may resorb

spontaneously.

Large (>3 cm), symptomatic pneumothorax: Needle aspiration or small-bore chest tube placement.

Patients who are unstable or who have recurrent pneumothorax: Chest tube placement.

PULMONARY SLEEP DISORDERS

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA

sleep disorder characterized Etiology may be include male sex, older age, (adenotonsillar smoking;.and many

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by transient obstruction of the upper airway that causes hypoxemia. Etiology may be central (eg, stroke), secondary (eg, obesity), or mixed. Risk factors include male sex, older age, obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, upper airway abnormalities (adenotonsillar hypertrophy [children]), sedative use (eg, alcohol, benzodiazepines), smoking, and many others.

History/PE Cardinal features: Irregular respiratory pattern during sleep: Obstructive apneas, hypopneas, or

respiratory effort–related arousals (RERAs)

Daytime symptoms related to poor sleep: Somnolence, fatigue, poor concentration, morning headaches

Signs of disturbed sleep: Snoring, gasping, choking, restlessness

KEY FACT

The STOP-BANG survey is a clinical questionnaire that can be used to assess the risk of OSA and direct further sleep testing: Snoring, Tiredness, Observed stop in breathing, increased blood Pressure, Body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m2, Age >50 years, Neck circumference >40 cm, male Gender. The presence of ≥3 positive items should prompt sleep testing.

Complications: ↑ cardiovascular morbidity (systemic hypertension, PAH, coronary artery disease,

t cardiovascular morbidity (systemic hypertension, PAH, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, polycythemia, and stroke)

arrhythmias, heart failure, polycythemia, and stroke) ↑ risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus ↑ risk for motor vehicle collisions caused by impaired alertness

Diagnosis Best initial test: Polysomnography (sleep study) based on apnea-hypopnea index ([AHI] = apneas + hypopneas/total hours of sleep) and presence or absence of related symptoms

Diagnosis is confirmed with the following:

AHI ≥5 PLUS symptoms AHI ≥15 regardless of symptoms

Treatment Best initial therapy: Weight loss (if applicable) and CPAP Alternatives: Oral appliances, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, and maxillomandibular

advancement (bones of upper and lower jaw surgically repositioned to relieve obstruction) Last resort: Tracheostomy
======================================
OBESITY HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROME

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a sleep disorder defined as awake alveolar hypoventilation in an obese individual that cannot be attributed to other conditions associated with alveolar hypoventilation.

History/PE Presents with hypersomnolence and obesity. OHS is further characterized by coexisting sleep disturbances: OHS with OSA (90% of patients): Presents with symptoms of OSA (see earlier section) OHS with sleep-related hypoventilation (10%): Presents the same as OHS + OSA but

obesity. OHS is further Presents with hypoventilation (10%): Presents uncommon

witnessed apneas during sleep are uncommon

Diagnosis Diagnosis of exclusion. Patient must meet all of the following criteria: Obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30 kg/m2) Awake alveolar hypoventilation (PaCO2 >45 mm Hg) Exclusion of alternative causes of hypercapnia and hypoventilation

Treatment Best initial treatment: Weight loss and noninvasive positive airway pressure (PAP)

OHS + OSA: CPAP Initiate bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) if initial management with CPAP fails OHS + hypoventilation: BiPAP

Next best treatment: Bariatric surgery Tracheostomy (last resort)

NOSE AND THROAT

RHINITIS

Rhinitis is characterized by symptoms of rhinorrhea (posterior or anterior), nasal congestion,

sneezing, and itching. Although most forms of rhinitis involve inflammation, some forms, such as vasomotor rhinitis, do not. It may be further classified into allergic and nonallergic causes.

Allergic Rhinitis

Pathogenesis Results from IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity reaction of the nasal mucosa Commonly associated with atopic diseases such as asthma and eczema

History/PE Presents with rhinitis in response to allergens. Based on temporal pattern, can be further classified as follows: Intermittent/seasonal: Allergic reactions to grass/trees or pollen (hay fever); occurs in

late spring/summer

Persistent/perennial: Allergic reactions to house dust, dust mites, molds, dogs, cats Food allergens: May also be contributory; however, evidence is lacking

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis based on typical history and nasal examination Skin prick test involves introducing common allergens into the skin to observe for

hypersensitivity reactions; this can help identify allergens

can help identify allergens increased (RAST) is a blood test

Serum total IgE is generally increased Serum radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) is a blood test that identifies IgE antibodies to

specific allergens
======================================
Treatment Allergen avoidance Medications:

Second-generation oral nonsedating antihistamines such as loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine

Intranasal steroids such as fluticasone, beclomethasone, or mometasone nasal sprays titrated to minimum effective dose; sometimes these internal steroids may be combined with intranasal antihistamines

Leukotriene antagonists such as montelukast; this is also beneficial with concomitant asthma

Immunotherapy: Allergen exposure and desensitization

Nonallergic Rhinitis Nonallergic rhinitis is a subtype of rhinitis without an allergic or infectious cause. It accounts for up to 50% of cases of rhinitis in adults.

Etiology/Pathogenesis Irritants: Cigarette smoke (tobacco), pollutants, occupational (chemicals such as cleaning

products)

Vasomotor: Caused by increased blood flow to the nasal mucosa; it is instigated by temperature changes or dry air and irritant odors

Gustatory: Clear rhinorrhea after ingestion of food (most often spicy) Drug induced: Due to antihypertensives, NSAIDs, PDE-5 inhibitors, or cocaine

Hormonal rhinitis: Onset during pregnancy; it resolves with end of pregnancy Senile rhinitis (also called atrophic rhinitis): occurs in older adults when the nasal glands

that produce moisture fail to function adequately

Diagnosis Workup to exclude allergic rhinitis (see earlier information).

Treatment Treatment is symptom driven. The patient should avoid any precipitating factors. Intranasal corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone) and intranasal antihistamines (eg, azelastine) alone or in combination treat nasal congestion, postnasal drip, rhinorrhea, and sneezing.

Intranasal anticholinergics (eg, ipratropium) treat rhinorrhea. Decongestants (eg, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline) help with nasal congestion.

Nasal irrigation and intranasal capsaicin may help.

NASAL POLYPS

Nasal polyps are benign outgrowths of nasal mucosa, and they represent the most common tumors of the nasal cavity. They commonly occur in association with allergic rhinitis, acute and chronic infections, and CF.

obstruction, postnasal discharge,

History/PE Patients present with nasal obstruction, postnasal discharge, congestion, sneezing,

rhinorrhea, hyposmia, and anosmia.
======================================
Important associations: Aspirin allergy Sinus infections Asthma

Diagnosis Coronal sinus CT scanning is first-line imaging modality. Endoscopy can sometimes be helpful for evaluation in the clinic. Nasal masses that do not appear typical or respond to treatment should be biopsied.

Treatment Medical treatment:

Oral corticosteroids are the most effective. Intranasal corticosteroids (mometasone, beclomethasone) are less effective. Other medical options include leukotriene antagonists (montelukast) or IL inhibitors (dupilumab).

Surgical removal is indicated in select cases due to severe symptoms of obstruction or infection refractory to medical treatment.

The physician should concomitantly treat predisposing factors (eg, underlying allergy).

EPISTAXIS

Epistaxis (bleeding from the nose) may either be anterior or posterior, based on the location

of bleeding. Anterior epistaxis: This is the most common (90%) and tends to be self-limited. Bleeding is most often from the Kiesselbach plexus (eg, the area of anastomosis of the septal branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery, the lateral nasal branch of the sphenopalatine artery, and the septal branch of the superior labial branch of the facial artery).

Posterior epistaxis: This is less common (10%) and may result in significant hemorrhage. Bleeding occurs from the posterolateral branches of the sphenopalatine artery and, rarely, the carotid artery.

Etiology Local causes of epistaxis include mucosal irritation (eg, nose picking, dry air, rhinitis, foreign body), facial trauma, intranasal drugs (cocaine, intranasal corticosteroids), or tumors (nasopharyngeal carcinomas).

Systemic conditions or drugs may also cause epistaxis (eg, anticoagulation, antiplatelet medications, alcohol, bleeding disorders [eg, von Willebrand disease], vascular malformations [nasal hemangioma], or hypertension).

Treatment Figure 2.14-33 outlines the approach to the management of epistaxis.

======================================
FIGURE 2.14-33. Approach to treatment of active nosebleed. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Initial assessment and resuscitation:

Assess and treat for airway, breathing, and cardiovascular (fluid resuscitation, redundant large-bore IV lines as indicated) compromise.

Target history to rule out conditions that predispose to bleeding (detailed earlier). Laboratory tests: Coagulation studies (for anticoagulated patients, CBC, type and

cross).

Initial conservative treatment:

Position patient: Elevate body and bend forward. Administer topical vasoconstrictor (eg, oxymetazoline) and local anesthetic (lidocaine)

and pinch nostrils for 10 to 15 minutes.

Apply cold compress. If conservative measures fail, examine nose to look for sources of bleeding

(rhinoscopy, speculum).

Subsequent treatment of anterior bleeding:

Cauterization: This is considered first line; either chemical (silver nitrate) or electrical

cautery is possible.

Nasal packing: Nasal tampons, ribbon gauze, or nasal balloon catheters can be used; if unilateral packing ineffective, bilateral nasal packing can be performed.

KEY FACT

Brisk bleeding even after adequate nasal packing may indicate a posterior source of bleeding.

Subsequent treatment of posterior bleeding:

Balloon catheter is preferred; alternatively, a Foley catheter can be used. These patients may require hospitalization and urgent ear, nose, and throat (ENT)

consultation.

Complications Prolonged retention of nasal packing (>72 hours) increases the risk of complications, including necrosis, toxic shock syndrome, sinus or nasolacrimal infections, and dislodgment.

KEY FACT

Consider toxic shock syndrome in a patient with fever, hypotension, desquamation, and mucosal hyperemia after receiving nasal packing.
======================================
ADENOTONSILLAR HYPERTROPHY

Adenoids develop at the posterior surface of the nasopharynx and grow to a final size at 6 to 7 years of age. Palatine tonsils are located toward the end of the soft palate. Both structures are dense in B and T lymphocytes and play a role in local immunity and in host immune defense. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is characterized by recurrent infections and hypertrophy of the lymphoid-rich structures.

History/PE Adenotonsillar hypertrophy usually manifests in children as recurrent infections and sleep- disordered breathing (SDB). Adenoid hypertrophy: History of mouth breathing, hyponasal voice, adenoid facies,

rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip is commonly described.

Tonsillar hypertrophy: History of recurrent infections (most commonly viral and then bacterial) and airway and feeding difficulties, such as dysphagia and SDB with OSA. Voice changes and dental malocclusion may be seen.

SDB: History of excessive daytime somnolence, failure to thrive, enuresis, poor school performance, and/or behavioral disturbance due to chronic sleep deprivation.

Diagnosis Adenoid hypertrophy: Rule out other causes of snoring and SDB such as anterior nasal

obstruction.

Best diagnostic test: Nasopharyngoscopy to visualize the hypertrophied adenoid tissue Other: Lateral x-ray of the neck to visualize the adenoids

Tonsillar hypertrophy: Tonsil grading by physical exam is informative. SDB: Best diagnostic test: Polysomnography.

Treatment Infections should be first treated with supportive treatment as needed (pain control,

adequate fluid intake, antibacterial if streptococcal infection is suspected).

Use modified Centor criteria to decide on the use of antibiotics against S pyogenes (most common bacterial pathogen): Absence of cough, swollen/tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, temperature >38°C (100.4°F), tonsillar exudate, age of individual.

Patients with recurrent infections (>7 episodes in the preceding year or >5 in the preceding 2 years or >4 in the preceding 3 years): Consider tonsillectomy.

Patients with obstructive SDB diagnosed by polysomnography: Perform adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy.
======================================
ACUTE AND CHRONIC LARYNGITIS

Laryngitis results from laryngeal inflammation due to several factors: excessive coughing, infections, vocal abuse/strain, gastroesophageal reflux, irritants such as smoking. Chronic laryngitis usually results from multiple factors leading over time to persistent inflammation.

History/PE Acute: Less than 3 weeks of hoarseness. Chronic: More than 3 weeks of hoarseness. History of the chief complaint reveals aforementioned inciting factors.

hoarseness. hoarseness. reveals aforementioned the head and neck

Diagnosis Perform physical examination of the head and neck (lymph nodes can be suggestive of

malignancy).

In select cases, perform nasopharyngoscopy to visualize the vocal cords (lesions on the vocal cord such as polyps or nodules, bilateral motion of the vocal cords, edema).

Treatment Supportive management is often needed with vocal hygiene (absolute silence is not

required), hydration, cough suppression, and avoidance of precipitating/irritating factors such as smoking.

Proton pump inhibitors are needed if reflux is suspected or diagnosed.

LARYNGOPHARYNGEAL REFLUX

Reflux of caustic gastric contents causing irritation of laryngeal tissue. Related to resting upper and lower esophageal sphincter tone and also to duration/magnitude of increased intra- abdominal pressure (eg, obesity would cause chronic increased intra-abdominal pressure).

History/PE Dysphonia Cough Globus

Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a rare disease caused by human papillomavirus

(HPV) infection of the upper airway, resulting in warty growths.

In about 3% to 5% of patients, malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma may occur.

The juvenile form is due to peripartum transmission from an infected mother. Children may need up to 20 repeat procedures during their lifetime, causing significant morbidity; however, remission may occur after several years.

The adult form is probably transmitted through oral sex.

Risk Factors Juvenile form: Triad of being firstborn, vaginal delivery, and mother’s age <20 years. Other risks include lower socioeconomic status. The physician should consider sexual abuse in children older than 5 years.

Adult form: More lifetime sexual partners and increased frequency of oral sex.

History/PE Hoarseness (most common), voice change, episodic choking, foreign body sensation, cough, dyspnea, inspiratory wheeze, and stridor.
======================================
Diagnosis Laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy.

Treatment there is no cure. repeated surgical debulking is mainstay of treatment. Cidofovir is injected in resection site

in select patients.

subcutaneous interferon therapy may be useful as second line. tracheostomy is used for significant airway obstruction. prevention is through quadrivalent HPV vaccination.

HYPERNATREMIA

Serum sodium >145 mEq/L. Usually caused by free water loss rather than sodium gain.

KEY FACT

Certain patients (eg, infants, intubated patients, immobilized patients, and those with altered mental status) may not drink enough free water to replace insensible losses. This can cause or worsen hypernatremia.

patients, immobilized free water to replace hypertonicity. Patients status, weakness, focal

History/PE Often presents with thirst caused by hypertonicity. Patients can present with neurologic symptoms including altered mental status, weakness, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures.

Diagnosis The etiology of hypernatremia can be determined by measuring urine osmolality.

If urine osmolality is >600 mOsm/kg, hypernatremia most likely stems from extrarenal water loss (insensible losses, nasogastric tube suction, diarrhea) or excess sodium intake. Measuring urine sodium through a fractional excretion of sodium can be helpful in distinguishing extrarenal losses (<1%) from sodium gain (>2%).

If urine osmolality is <300 mOsm/kg, diabetes insipidus (DI) is the most likely cause of hypernatremia. A desmopressin challenge can differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI.

Rise in urine osmolality with desmopressin = Central DI No rise in urine osmolality with desmopressin = Nephrogenic DI

Intermediate values (300–600 mOsm/kg) are often seen in osmotic diuresis or partial DI.

Treatment Determine volume status. If the patient is hypovolemic with unstable vital signs, use

isotonic 0.9% NaCl before correcting free water deficits. Use isotonic 0.9% NaCl until the patient is approaching euvolemia.

Determine free water deficit.

Water deficit = Total body water × ([serum Na/140] − 1).

Total body water (TBW) is ~60% of lean body weight (in kg).

Determine rate of correction. Correction of chronic hypernatremia (duration >48 hours) should be accomplished gradually over 48 to 72 hours (≤0.5 mEq/L/hr) to prevent neurologic damage secondary to cerebral edema. In acute hypernatremia (<48 hours), the entire free water deficit can be corrected within 24 hours.

Free water deficit can then be corrected with dextrose 5% water (D5W), 0.45% NaCl, or enteral fluids.

HYPONATREMIA

Serum sodium <135 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is most commonly caused by ↑ ADH, whether physiologic (eg, in decreased effective circulating volume) or pathologic (as in syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [SIADH]). There are some ADH-independent etiologies, such as primary polydipsia, starvation (solute deficiency), and the presence of a nonsodium effective osmole in the extracellular fluid (eg, glucose in hyperglycemia).

History/PE May be asymptomatic, but can present with confusion, lethargy, muscle cramps, and

nausea.

Can progress to seizures, coma, or brainstem herniation. Severity of symptoms depends on rate and degree of hyponatremia.

Diagnosis Measure serum osmolality (sOsm). Hypotonic hyponatremia (sOsm <280) is the most common type of hyponatremia and is further categorized by volume status. See Figure 2.15-1 for the full diagnostic algorithm.

effective osmotic solute. This is commonly seen in hyperglycemia. Be sure to “correct” serum sodium for hyperglycemia by adding 1.6 mEq/L to the sodium for every 100 mg/dL elevation in glucose above 200 mg/dL. For example, a patient with a measured serum sodium concentration of 133 mEq/L and a blood glucose concentration of 400 mg/dL actually has a serum sodium concentration closer to 136 mEq/L.

Isotonic hyponatremia (sOsm 280–295) is most commonly due to a laboratory measurement artifact. Conditions such as hyperlipidemia/hypertriglyceridemia or hyperproteinemia (after intravenous [IV] immunoglobulin infusion or in multiple myeloma) increase the solid phase of plasma, meaning there is less water (where sodium is diluted) in the analyzed sample, which is not corrected by the machine.

Q

A 29-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. On examination she seems hypovolemic, with vitals measured at blood pressure (BP) of 92/50 mm Hg and heart rate (HR) of 106 beats per minute (bpm). Her serum sodium level is 154 mEq/L. What is the next best step in management?

Treatment Treat the underlying disorder. Treat hyponatremia from hypervolemic and euvolemic

etiologies with water restriction ± diuretics. If hypovolemic, replete volume with NaCl. If severe hyponatremia (Na <120 mEq/L), consider 3% hypertonic saline, particularly if symptomatic (eg, seizures).

Correct chronic hyponatremia (>72 hours’ duration) slowly (<10 mEq/L/day) to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (symptoms include paraparesis/quadriparesis, dysarthria, and coma). See Figure 2.15-2.

KEY FACT

Consider using hypertonic saline only if a patient has seizures or acute neurologic decline caused by hyponatremia and when serum Na+ is <120 mEq/L.

KEY FACT

Correcting hyponatremia too rapidly can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Cellular shifts: Cell lysis, tissue injury (rhabdomyolysis), tumor lysis syndrome, insulin

deficiency, acidosis, drugs (eg, succinylcholine, digitalis, arginine, nonselective β- blockers), hyperosmolality, exercise

↑ intake: Food (most fruits, potatoes), iatrogenic, absorption of blood (from hematomas, gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding)

History/PE May be asymptomatic or may present with nausea, vomiting, intestinal colic, areflexia, weakness, flaccid paralysis, arrhythmias, and/or paresthesia.

Diagnosis Confirmation of hyperkalemia with a repeat blood draw for suspected spurious results. In the setting of extreme leukocytosis or thrombocytosis, the physician should check plasma K+ (as opposed to serum K+, since potassium can be released from cells in serum and falsely elevate the result).

Other workup: ECG to evaluate for cardiac complications. ECG findings include tall, peaked T waves; a wide QRS; PR prolongation; and loss of P waves (see Fig. 2.15-3). Can progress to sine waves, ventricular dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

QRS widening Peaked T PR prolongation

FIGURE 2.15-3. Hyperkalemia on ECG. Electrocardiographic manifestations include peaked T waves, PR prolongation, and a widened QRS complex. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

Treatment Best initial treatment: It is critical to administer calcium gluconate for cardiac cell

membrane stabilization if K+ >6.5 mEq/L or if ECG changes are present.

Give insulin with glucose (to avoid hypoglycemia), β-agonists (eg, continuous inhaled albuterol), and/or alkali (eg, bicarbonate) to temporarily shift K+ into cells. This is the most rapid way to shift K+ into cells.

anuric/oliguric), consider IV saline (in the setting of hypovolemia) or loop diuretics (in normovolemia/hypervolemia) to enhance urinary excretion of potassium. Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate) is a medication that exchanges sodium for potassium in the bowel and can be used to excrete potassium in the setting of a lack of residual renal function. Contraindications to this include ileus, bowel obstruction, ischemic gut, or pancreatic transplants (can cause bowel necrosis).
======================================
A

This patient probably has nephrogenic diabetes insipidus from presumed lithium use. She is hypovolemic with unstable vital signs; therefore, the next best step in management calls for initial treatment with normal saline (NS), followed by a switch to D5W once her volume status improves.

Eliminate K+ from the diet, medications (eg, penicillin has K+), and IV fluids. Dialysis is needed for patients with renal failure and hyperkalemia refractory to the

aforementioned medical management.

HYPOKALEMIA

Serum K+ <3.6 mEq/L. Etiologies include:

Transcellular shifts: Insulin, β2-agonists, and alkalosis all cause K+ to shift intracellularly (see Fig. 2.15-4).

FIGURE 2.15-4. Causes of transcellular K+ shifts. ECF, Extracellular fluid; ICF, intracellular fluid. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

GI losses: Diarrhea, chronic laxative abuse, vomiting, nasogastric tube suction. Renal losses: Diuretics (eg, loop or thiazide), primary mineralocorticoid excess or secondary hyperaldosteronism, ↓ circulating volume (stimulates renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system [RAAS]− and mineralocorticoid-associated K+ secretion), Bartter and Gitelman syndromes, drugs (eg, gentamicin, amphotericin), diabetic ketoacidosis, hypomagnesemia, type I and type II RTA.

KEY FACT

If a patient is on digitalis, K+ levels must be carefully monitored. Hypokalemia sensitizes the heart to digitalis toxicity, because K+ and digitalis compete for the same sites on the Na+/K+ pump.

History/PE Hypokalemia is usually asymptomatic, but it can present with fatigue, muscle weakness or cramps, ileus, hyporeflexia, paresthesias, rhabdomyolysis, and ascending paralysis.

Diagnosis Other workup: ECG may show T-wave flattening, U waves (an additional wave after the T wave), and ST-segment depression, leading to atrioventricular (AV) block and subsequent cardiac arrest. See Figure 2.15-5.

FIGURE 2.15-5. Hypokalemia on ECG. Prominent U wave indicated by arrow. (Reproduced with permission from Van Beers EJ, Stam J, van den Bergh WM. Licorice consumption as a cause of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: a case report. Crit Care. 2011;15[1]:R64.)
======================================
KEY FACT

Hypokalemia is usually caused by renal ± GI losses.

Treatment Treat the underlying disorder. Oral and/or IV K+ repletion. Oral is the preferred route for safety purposes. If IV is

necessary, a continuous rate of K+ as an additive is preferred over an IV K+ bolus. IV boluses should be reserved for symptomatic hypokalemia or ECG changes. Treatment should not exceed 20 mEq/L/hr.

Replacement of magnesium. This deficiency makes K+ repletion more difficult.

KEY FACT

If hypokalemia is not responding to K+ repletion, check magnesium levels.

Treatment of hyperkalemia— C BIG K Calcium chloride or gluconate (intravenous) Bicarbonate, β2-agonists Insulin + Glucose Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate)

HYPERCALCEMIA

Serum calcium >10.2 mg/dL. The most common causes are the following:

Hyperparathyroidism Malignancy (eg, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma) Other causes in the mnemonic CHIMPANZEES. See Mnemonic box.

MNEMONIC

Causes of hypercalcemia— CHIMPANZEES Calcium supplementation Hyperparathyroidism/Hyperthyroidism Iatrogenic (eg, thiazides, parenteral nutrition)/Immobility (especially in the intensive care unit [ICU] setting) Milk-alkali syndrome (excessive intake of calcium and absorbable alkali) Paget disease Adrenal insufficiency/Acromegaly Neoplasm Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] type 1) Excess vitamin A Excess vitamin D Sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases

History/PE Usually asymptomatic but can present with bones (osteopenia, fractures), stones (kidney stones), abdominal groans (anorexia, constipation), and psychiatric overtones (weakness, fatigue, irritability, altered mental status).

Diagnosis Best initial test: Check of total/ionized calcium and albumin. Reasoning: A large portion of serum calcium is albumin bound, and changes in albumin concentration can lead to alterations in serum calcium concentration that do not necessarily affect ionized calcium (the physiologically active form.) In general, when correcting for serum albumin

concentration, the physician can assume that serum calcium falls by 0.8 mg/dL for every 1 g/dL decrease in serum albumin below 4 g/dL.

Also consider: Phosphate, magnesium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase levels. The following tests apply: parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP) if malignancy is suspected; serum protein electrophoresis for multiple myeloma; vitamin D (total 25 vitamin D and 1,25 vitamin D levels) if granulomatous disease (eg, sarcoidosis), iatrogenic vitamin D intake, or tuberculosis (TB) is suspected.

Other workup: ECG may show shortened QT interval. See Figure 2.15-6 for diagnostic testing algorithm.

KEY FACT

Serum calcium levels may be incidentally low in hypoalbuminemia; check ionized calcium. Corrected Ca2+ = Total serum Ca2+ + 0.8 (4 − serum albumin).

Treatment The physician should treat the underlying disorder. Mild hypercalcemia (albumin-corrected calcium <12 mg/dL) does not require urgent treatment. Patients should be encouraged to maintain adequate hydration (to avoid nephrolithiasis) and to avoid factors that worsen hypercalcemia (thiazides, high calcium intake, inactivity).

If serum calcium >14 mg/dL, a patient requires urgent treatment with isotonic IV fluids (± furosemide) and calcitonin; bisphosphonates (eg, zoledronic acid, pamidronate) should be considered as well. High sodium intake (in isotonic fluids) facilitates renal calcium excretion and prevents renal complications (stones).

Asymptomatic patients with serum calcium between 12 and 14 mg/dL do not require emergent treatment—they may follow the same precautions noted earlier for mild hypercalcemia, as well as some therapies (eg, isotonic fluids) to facilitate excretion of

calcium before symptoms develop.

KEY FACT

Loop diuretics (furosemide) Lose calcium. Thiazide diuretics ↑ Tubular reabsorption of calcium.

HYPOCALCEMIA

Serum calcium <8.5 mg/dL. Etiologies include the following:

Parathyroid-related: Hypoparathyroidism (postsurgical, idiopathic), chronic kidney disease (causing secondary hyperparathyroidism), and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PTH resistance). In infants, consider abnormal parathyroid development in DiGeorge syndrome.

Malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency. Other: Hypomagnesemia, acute pancreatitis, and chelation from citrate found in blood

products.

History/PE Hypocalcemia presents with abdominal muscle cramps, dyspnea, tetany, perioral and acral

abdominal muscle cramps, of the facial.nerve pressure (BP) cuff hypocalcemia.

paresthesias, and convulsions.

Facial spasms elicited from tapping of the facial nerve (Chvostek sign) and carpal spasms after arterial occlusion by a blood pressure (BP) cuff (Trousseau sign) are classic findings most commonly seen in severe hypocalcemia.
======================================
KEY FACT

A classic case of hypocalcemia is a patient who develops cramps and tetany following thyroidectomy because of parathyroidectomy as a complication.

KEY FACT

Hypomagnesemia is very commonly seen in the setting of chronic excessive alcohol consumption.

KEY FACT

Acetylsalicylic acid ([ASA] salicylate) overdose can cause both metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis.

KEY FACT

Ethylene glycol presentation = Urine calcium oxalate (envelope-shaped) crystals Methanol presentation = Vision loss, optic disc hyperemia

Both present with ↑ osmolal gap (measured osmolality − calculated osmolality >10 mOsmol/L)

Diagnosis Most accurate test: Ionized Ca2+ and PTH. See the Endocrinology chapter for

interpretation of PTH levels.

Other labs: Mg2+ (low levels can induce PTH resistance); albumin; 25-OH vitamin D; 1,25-OH vitamin D levels; and electrolytes. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase values may also be helpful to assess, depending on the clinical situation.

Other workup: ECG may show prolonged QT interval.

Treatment Treat the underlying disorder. In most cases, the physician will need to administer oral calcium supplements; severe

symptoms or signs call for oral and IV calcium.

Ensure magnesium repletion.

HYPOMAGNESEMIA

Etiologies are as follows: short bowel (PPIs) hypercalcemia, pancreatitis,

Serum magnesium <1.5 mEq/L. Etiologies are as follows:

↓ intake: Malnutrition, malabsorption, short bowel syndrome, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

↑ loss: Diuretics, diarrhea, vomiting, hypercalcemia, excessive alcohol consumption Miscellaneous: Diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, extracellular fluid volume expansion

History/PE In severe cases, symptoms may include hyperactive reflexes, tetany, paresthesias, irritability, confusion, lethargy, seizures, and arrhythmias.

Diagnosis Lab results may show concurrent hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. ECG may reveal prolonged PR and QT intervals.

Treatment Generally, most causes respond to IV and/or oral supplements, depending on severity. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia will not correct without magnesium correction.

URINE ANION GAP

Calculated for normal anion gap acidosis to distinguish renal vs GI bicarbonate loss. Urine anion gap (UAG) = [Urine Na+] + [Urine K+] − [Urine Cl−]. Urine NH4

+ (which represents renal acid excretion but is difficult to measure) is excreted along with Cl– in the urine. A negative UAG indicated increased urine Cl–, which suggests that acid (NH4 loss or proximal/type 2 RTA. – +) is being excreted by the kidneys. This can be seen in cases of GI HCO3

======================================
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY

Formerly known as acute renal failure, acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as ↓ renal function, compared with a previous baseline within a period of <3 months, leading to the retention of creatinine. ↓ urine output (oliguria, defined as <0.5 mL/kg/hr) is not required for AKI, but if present can be part of the diagnostic criteria. Complications include metabolic acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload, and uremia. Many cases of AKI will recover with treatment and/or supportive care, but each episode of AKI can lead to chronic effects and scarring and progressively develop into chronic kidney disease (especially with very severe or recurrent AKI). See Table 2.15-3 for the workup of AKI.

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Defined as the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min in adults, <90 mL/min in children; persistent proteinuria, or structural damage) for 3 or more months, regardless of the cause. In adults, it is most commonly caused by poorly controlled or long-standing diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension. Other causes (in all ages) include:

regardless or long-standing:diabetes ages) include: and chronic use of other in patients with and/or.recurrent AKI infections

Analgesic use (chronic NSAIDs) and chronic use of other nephrotoxic medications Renovascular disease, particularly in patients with peripheral arterial disease History of prolonged, severe, and/or recurrent AKI Severe or recurrent urinary tract infections Urinary tract obstruction Inherited kidney diseases (such as polycystic kidney disease) Glomerular disease Congenital abnormalities in kidneys or urinary tract (most common cause in children) A subset of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will go on to develop CKD stage 5 (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2), which is designated as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) when requiring renal replacement therapy (dialysis).
======================================
1 A

The most likely diagnosis is an aspirin overdose. Though her pH is normal, she has a mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. Her bicarbonate is low, indicating a metabolic acidosis. Winters formula predicts that the patient’s PaCO2 under normal compensation should be 29 [PaCO2 = 1.5 (HCO3 indicates a concurrent respiratory alkalosis.

2 A

The patient’s symptoms and lab results indicate respiratory muscle fatigue. The next best

step in management may be urgent intubation.

History/PE CKD is generally asymptomatic until GFR is <30 mL/min/1.73m2, but patients can gradually experience the signs and symptoms of disorders such as:

Hyperkalemia Metabolic acidosis Secondary hyperparathyroidism (impaired vitamin D activation, decreased phosphate

excretion, hypocalcemia, renal osteodystrophy)

Anemia of CKD Uremia (seen most commonly in very advanced CKD—symptoms and complications

Uremia (seen most commonly in very advanced CKD—symptoms and complications include anorexia, nausea/vomiting, uremic pericarditis, uremic frost, delirium, impaired platelet aggregation, seizures and coma)

include anorexia, nausea/vomiting, uremic pericarditis, uremic frost, delirium, impaired platelet aggregation, seizures and coma) Depending on the etiology, patients can exhibit a varying degree of edema and

hypertension because of their reduced ability to excrete salt and water (also seen frequently in those with nephrotic-range proteinuria.)

Diagnosis A diagnosis of CKD requires persistently impaired renal function or proteinuria, confirmed by repeating laboratory assessment 3 months after initially detected.

3 months after initially considered to determine unexplained tubulointerstitial <130/80 mm Hg in glomerular filtration and CKD thus

Kidney biopsy may need to be considered to determine the etiology of CKD when there is suspicion of glomerulonephritis or unexplained tubulointerstitial disease.

Management Ensure tight BP control—target <130/80 mm Hg in adults. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) decrease glomerular filtration pressures and can decrease the rate of progression of proteinuria and CKD (and thus should be the first choice for antihypertensive agents in this population).
======================================
KEY FACT

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in dialysis and renal transplant patients (>50%). Infectious complications are the second most common cause (and most common cause of death in pediatric dialysis and transplant patients).

Reduce cardiovascular risk by starting statin therapy for patients with CKD over the age of 50 years or for those 18 to 49 years of age with CKD plus a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), DM, or prior stroke.

Manage anemia—recommend erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for patients with anemia in CKD with a hemoglobin concentration <10 g/dL despite adequate iron stores.

Monitor serum phosphorus, calcium, and PTH to assess risk for mineral and bone disorders. Manage persistent hyperphosphatemia with oral phosphate binders (calcium acetate, calcium carbonate, sevelamer, lanthanum). Consider calcitriol (1,25-OH vitamin D) for patients with persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism to reduce the risk of osteodystrophy.

Manage persistent metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate <22 mEq/L) with alkali salt

therapy (most commonly oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation).

Ensure medications are dose adjusted, taking into account the patient’s GFR. Patients with a GFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 should start education regarding renal

replacement therapy (dialysis, transplant). Patients anticipating initiation of hemodialysis should be referred to a vascular surgeon for creation of a fistula.

A disorder of glomerular inflammation, also called glomerulonephritis. Proteinuria may be present but is variable. If severe glomerular inflammation, it can exceed 2 g/day and lead to a concurrent nephrotic syndrome. Most cases of glomerulonephritis are usually associated with less proteinuria, often <1.5 g/day.

KEY FACT

Postinfectious glomerulonephritis will present 2 to 6 weeks after an infection and has a low C3; IgA nephropathy will present concurrent with an infection and has a normal C3.

KEY FACT

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis = kidney + lung + sinus Microscopic polyangiitis = kidney + lung Churg-Strauss syndrome = kidney + asthma

History/PE

The classic findings of nephritic syndrome may include microscopic or macroscopic (if so, tea- or cola-colored urine), hypertension, and/or edema.

Diagnosis Urinalysis (UA) shows hematuria and variable degrees of proteinuria. In most severe cases, patients may have a ↓ GFR with elevated BUN and creatinine. See

Table 2.15-5 for pertinent labs.

Renal biopsy may be needed for histologic evaluation and treatment and prognosis considerations.

Two specific examples of findings are shown in Figure 2.15-10.

Treatment If present, treat hypertension, fluid overload with salt restriction, RAAS blockade, ±

diuretics.

In some cases, depending on the etiology, corticosteroids ± other immunosuppressant agents are a necessary treatment to reduce glomerular inflammation.
======================================
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME

Nephrotic syndrome is defined as follows:

Hyperproteinuria (≥3.5 g/day) Hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia—albumin levels fall because of protein loss Hyperlipidemia (may result in accelerated atherosclerosis if chronic) Edema

Nephrotic syndrome can cause a hypercoagulable state with thrombosis due to loss of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S in urine.

Approximately one third of all cases result from systemic diseases such as DM, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or amyloidosis. In children, the most common cause is minimal change disease, a primary disease of the kidney and not a systemic disease. Causes and findings are summarized in Table 2.15-6.

KEY FACT

Differential diagnosis for nephritic/nephrotic syndrome with low C3: Postinfectious, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (including mixed cryoglobulinemia) and lupus nephritis.

History/PE Presents with generalized edema. Sometimes patients will notice they have foamy urine. In severe cases, dyspnea and ascites and other complications from anasarca may develop. Patients have ↑ susceptibility to infection (caused by loss of IgG protein in the urine) and hypercoagulable states with an ↑ risk for venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (caused by loss of antithrombin 3, increased platelet aggregation, and changes in protein C and S levels). This increased risk of hypercoagulability commonly manifests as renal vein thrombosis.

KEY FACT

Mixed cryoglobulinemia presents with palpable purpura, arthralgias, nephritic/nephrotic syndrome, low C3, and positive hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Diagnosis

5

UA shows proteinuria (≥3.5 g/day) and may show lipiduria (Maltese crosses signifying lipids on microscopic urine exam). It is now more common for clinicians to use a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio rather than 24-hour urine. The cutoff for nephrotic syndrome is 2.0 on this ratio.

Blood chemistry shows ↓ albumin (<3 g/dL) and hyperlipidemia. Evaluation should include workup for secondary causes. Renal biopsy may also be needed to definitively diagnose the underlying etiology.

Treatment Treat with salt restriction and judicious diuretic therapy. If the patient is hypertensive, the physician can use RAAS blockade and/or diuretic

therapy.

If nephrotic syndrome is chronic, the physician may need to treat the patient with statins. A history of or a suspicion for thrombosis calls for anticoagulants.

Steroids and/or other immunosuppressant medications may be useful for certain etiologies. ACE inhibitors/ARBs ↓ proteinuria and diminish the progression of renal disease in

patients with renal scarring (especially in patients with diabetes).

Vaccinate patients with 23-polyvalent pneumococcus vaccine (PPV23), as patients are at ↑ risk for Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, based on hypogammaglobulinemia from immunoglobulin losses in urine and edema (pulmonary edema, ascites).

NEPHROLITHIASIS

Renal calculi. Stones are most commonly calcium oxalate, but many other types exist (see Table 2.15-7). Risk factors include a ⊕ family history, low fluid intake, gout, medications (allopurinol, chemotherapy, loop diuretics), postcolectomy/postileostomy, specific enzyme deficiencies, type I RTA (caused by alkaline urinary pH and associated hypocitraturia), and hyperparathyroidism.

KEY FACT

The bacteria associated with “staghorn calculi” are urease-producing organisms, such as Proteus and Klebsiella.

associated with nausea and vomiting.

and shift position hematuria (85%). is the gold standard

Patients are unable to get comfortable and shift position frequently (as opposed to those with peritonitis, who lie still).

Diagnosis UA may show gross or microscopic hematuria (85%). Noncontrast abdominal CT scan is the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney stones

(see Fig. 2.15-11).

FIGURE 2.15-11. Nephrolithiasis. CT scan shows a dense 1-cm calcification (arrow) in the left ureter, consistent with nephrolithiasis. (Reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

Ultrasound is preferred for pregnant patients and children when there is a low likelihood for another pathology.

Plain x-rays of the abdomen are still useful for following the progression/treatment of

larger stones.

KEY FACT

In gout, urate crystals are needle shaped. In contrast, uric acid nephroliths are pleomorphic.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Hydration and analgesia (see Fig. 2.15-12).

FIGURE 2.15-12. Nephrolithiasis treatment algorithm. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

α1-Receptor blockers (eg, tamsulosin) and calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine) reduce ureteral spasms and facilitate passage of ureteral stone <10 mm, reducing the need for analgesics.

Treatment varies according to the size and diameter of the stone:

<5 mm: May pass spontaneously <10 mm: Higher rate of spontaneous passage with α-blocker or calcium channel

blocker therapy

<5 to 20 mm: May be treated with shock wave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy >20 mm: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy

Dietary changes to prevent calcium stones include ↑ fluid intake (most important), normal calcium intake (recommended daily allowance [RDA]), and ↓ sodium intake. If caused by hyperoxaluria, then ↓ oxalate intake.

Indications for a urologic consult: Stone size >9 mm, refractory pain/vomiting, signs of sepsis or complete obstruction
======================================
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Characterized by the presence of progressive cystic dilation of the renal tubules. Polycystic kidney disease includes two main types—ADPKD and ARPKD.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD):

Most common Usually asymptomatic until patients are >30 years of age (as cysts gradually enlarge

with time), although about 10% of these patients present in childhood

Possible formation in other organs, especially the liver, pancreas, spleen, and epididymis

In one half of ADPKD patients, ESRD to require dialysis by 60 years of age; other patients may simply have mildly reduced renal function and only require supportive care and BP control

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD):

Less common but more severe Presents in infants and young children with renal failure, liver fibrosis, and portal

hypertension; ARPKD can lead to death in the first few days of life if associated with in utero oliguria (oligohydramnios) leading to Potter sequence

KEY FACT

If a patient with known ADPKD develops a sudden-onset, severe headache, rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured berry aneurysm!

develops a sudden-onset, ruptured berry aneurysm! hypertension, bilateral hematuria. Polyuria and

History/PE ADPKD:

Presenting symptoms are hypertension, bilateral palpable abdominal masses, flank pain, history of UTI or gross hematuria. Polyuria and nocturia can also be seen. Sharp, localized pain may result from cyst rupture, infection, or passage of renal calculi.

Additional findings include hepatic/pancreatic cysts, cerebral berry aneurysms (especially in patients with ⊕ family history; risk also increases with age), valvular heart disease (mitral valve prolapse [MVP] and aortic regurgitation [AR]), colonic diverticula, and abdominal and inguinal hernia.

ARPKD: Hypertension, abdominal distention, and flank masses are the most common presenting findings. It is most commonly identified prenatally.

ADPKD and ARPKD:

Patients may have large, palpable kidneys on abdominal examination. A single, simple renal cyst in an adult does not suggest ADPKD and does not require

further evaluation.
======================================
Q

A 19-year-old man with a history of recurrent kidney stones presents with acute left flank pain. His father also has a history of kidney stones. A urinary cyanide nitroprusside test is ⊕. A CT scan confirms nephrolithiasis. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Diagnosis Based on ultrasonography (most common) or CT scan (see Fig. 2.15-13). Multiple bilateral

cysts will be present throughout the renal parenchyma, and renal enlargement will be visualized. Genetic testing for ADPKD (PKD1 and PKD2 genes) and ARPKD (PKHD gene) is available but often not necessary. Patients >18 years of age with + family history may be offered a screening ultrasound.

FIGURE 2.15-13. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. (A) Contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrates bilaterally enlarged kidneys that have been almost entirely replaced by cysts (arrows). (B) Gross specimen of a right kidney from a patient with ADPKD who underwent renal transplantation. (Image A adapted with permission from Fauci AS et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 17th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008. Image B reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

Treatment Prevent complications and ↓ the rate of progression to ESRD. Early management of

urinary tract infections (UTIs) is critical to prevent renal cyst infection. BP control (ACE inhibitors, ARBs) is necessary to ↓ hypertension-induced renal damage and control proteinuria. Sodium intake should also be limited. Aggressive lipid control with statin to decrease CV risk.

Dialysis and renal transplantation are used to manage patients with ESRD. High fluid intake is helpful to prevent development of kidney stones and may be helpful at

slowing cyst progression too (ADH stimulates cyst growth). Vasopressin receptor antagonists have also been approved for use.

HYDRONEPHROSIS

Dilation of the urinary tract—often secondary to downstream obstruction of the urinary tract. In pediatric patients, the obstruction is often at the ureteropelvic junction but may also be at the ureterovesicular junction (at the insertion into the bladder) or at the bladder outlet (eg from “posterior urethral valves”). In adults, it may be caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and aortic aneurysms. In both children and adults, it may be from neurogenic bladder (spinal cord injuries), tumors, or renal calculi. Apart from obstruction, hydronephrosis can also be caused by excessively high-output urinary flow and vesicoureteral reflux.

History/PE May be asymptomatic or may present with flank/back pain, abdominal pain, and/or UTIs.
======================================
KEY FACT

Left untreated, hydronephrosis resulting from urinary obstruction poses a risk for infection and sepsis, as well as kidney damage with resulting hypertension, acute kidney injury, and/or chronic kidney disease.

Diagnosis Ultrasonography or CT scan to detect dilation of the renal pelvis, calyces (see Fig. 2.15-14A), and/or ureter.

FIGURE 2.15-14. Hydronephrosis. (A) Ultrasound of a renal transplant shows severe hydronephrosis, with dilation of the renal pelvis (P) and the renal calyces (C). The overlying

renal cortex is severely thinned (arrows). (B) Normal renal ultrasound for comparison. C, cortex; S, sinus fat. (Reproduced with permission from Tanagho EA, McAninch JW. Smith’s General Urology, 17th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2008.)

Treatment Some pediatric cases will spontaneously resolve. Otherwise, the only treatment is to surgically correct any anatomic obstruction or reflux; if the patient has a neurogenic bladder, the physician can start a clean intermittent catheterization regimen for bladder emptying.

Ureteral stent placement across the obstructed area of the urinary tract and/or percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement to relieve pressure may be appropriate if the urinary outflow tract is not sufficiently cleared of obstruction. Foley or suprapubic catheters may be required for lower urinary tract obstruction (eg, BPH).

Cystinuria is the most likely diagnosis. It refers to decreased cystine reabsorption caused by a defect in proximal tubular amino acid transport. Hexagonal crystals probably would be visible on UA.

AND SWELLING generalized.edematous in angioedema or allergic scrotum can.be broken

SCROTAL PAIN AND SWELLING

Scrotal wall swelling can be seen in generalized edematous states (nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, congestive heart failure) or in angioedema or allergic reactions. Etiologies of a swollen/enlarged scrotum can be broken down as follows (see Fig. 2.15-15):

FIGURE 2.15-15. Evaluation of scrotal swelling. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Painless etiologies → hydrocele (remnant of processus vaginalis; may be accompanied by inguinal hernia), varicocele (dilatation of pampiniform plexus), tumors

Painful etiologies → epididymitis, orchitis, testicular torsion (twisting and subsequent

ischemia of the spermatic cord), incarcerated inguinal hernias Prostatitis (both acute and chronic), distally migrated ureteral stones, and chronic pelvic

pain syndrome can manifest as scrotal pain.

History/PE Detailed history regarding preceding viral infections, UTIs, sexual activity, and acuity of onset of swelling and/or pain should be obtained. Testicular torsion tends to present very acutely with severe pain that can lead to nausea/emesis, whereas other etiologies present

more gradually. Physical examination can reveal a number of characteristic features:

Hydrocele can present with a transilluminating scrotum. Increase of size during Valsalva maneuver could indicate communicating hydrocele.

Varicocele does not transilluminate. It is often described as having a “bag of worms” texture to palpation, and more commonly it is seen in the left testicle (see Fig. 2.15-16). Varicoceles can also augment with the Valsalva maneuver.

FIGURE 2.16-16. Varicocele. Multiple tortuous tubular like structures are seen in the left scrotum. (Reproduced with permission from Mak CW, Tzeng WS. Sonography of the scrotum. Available at https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/27883.)

Causes of urinary incontinence without specific urogenital pathology— DIAPPERS Delirium/confusion Infection Atrophic urethritis/vaginitis Pharmaceutical Psychiatric disorders (especially depression) Excessive urinary output (hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia) Restricted mobility Stool impaction

Diagnosis/Treatment A UA can evaluate for pyuria that might suggest a UTI. Assessing serum creatinine can reveal signs of renal dysfunction if urinary obstruction leading to overflow is suspected.

Voiding diaries may be helpful in better defining the type of incontinence. Urodynamic and radiographic testing is not routinely done for evaluation of incontinence.

These measures merit consideration if plans exist for surgical management of incontinence.

Table 2.15-8 outlines treatment options according to subtype.
======================================
INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS (PAINFUL BLADDER SYNDROME)

Chronic, painful bladder condition that is associated with psychiatric disorders, other pain syndromes (eg, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), and a history of UTIs. The onset is gradual. Pain exacerbated by bladder filling, exercise, sexual intercourse, alcohol consumption, and prolonged sitting. Pain is relieved with voiding. Interstitial cystitis is more common in females.

History/PE Lower urinary tract symptoms UA normal Symptoms for >6 weeks

Diagnosis Primarily clinical.

Treatment Avoiding triggers (behavioral modification) first line Physical therapy, analgesics Amitriptyline for refractory symptoms

ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

Found in 10% to 25% of middle-aged and older adult males. Classified as failure to initiate (eg, psychologic, endocrinologic, neurologic), failure to fill (eg, arteriogenic), or failure to store (eg, veno-occlusive dysfunction). Risk factors include DM, atherosclerosis, medications (eg, β-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], diuretics), hypertension, heart disease, surgery or radiation for prostate cancer, and spinal cord injury.

History/PE Ask about risk factors (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease), medication use, recent life

changes, and psychologic stressors.

The distinction between psychologic and organic erectile dysfunction (ED) is based on situational dependence (eg, occurring with only one partner) and the presence of nocturnal or early-morning erections with penile tumescence testing (if present, it is nonorganic).

KEY FACT

Evaluate for neurologic dysfunction (eg, anal tone, lower extremity sensation) and for hypogonadism (eg, small testes, loss of secondary sexual characteristics).

Other workup: Screening for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and serum testosterone. Elevated prolactin can result in ↓ in androgen activity.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Patients with psychologic ED may benefit from psychotherapy

involving discussion and exercises with the partner.

Oral sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil are phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors that result in prolonged action of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)–mediated smooth muscle relaxation and ↑ blood flow in the corpora cavernosa.

Although sildenafil is useful for patients with ED secondary to cardiovascular disease, use with nitrates is contraindicated.

Testosterone is a useful therapy for patients with hypogonadism of testicular or pituitary origin; it is discouraged for patients with normal testosterone levels.

Vacuum pumps, intracavernosal injections of prostaglandins or other vasoactive agents, and surgical implantation of semirigid or inflatable penile prostheses are alternatives for patients for whom PDE-5 therapy fails or is contraindicated.
======================================
KEY FACT

Nitrates and PDE-5 inhibitors are a dangerous combination → significant ↓ BP, which can lead to myocardial ischemia.

BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA

Enlargement of the prostate that is a normal part of the aging process and is seen in >80% of males by 80 years of age. Most commonly presents in males >50 years of age. BPH can coexist with prostate cancer, but BPH does not cause prostate cancer. See comparison between BPH and prostate cancer (Table 2.15-9).

emptying, urinary retention, bladder fullness, acute urinary retention following surgery. Irritative symptoms: Nocturia, daytime frequency, urge incontinence, opening hematuria. On digital rectal exam (DRE), the prostate is uniformly enlarged with a rubbery texture.

The physician should suspect cancer if the prostate is hard or has irregular lesions.

Diagnosis Obtain a UA and urine culture to rule out infection and hematuria. Initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is controversial, although often ↑ in BPH. Further workup is needed if ↑ PSA correlates with other findings suspicious for prostate cancer.

Consider creatinine levels to rule out obstructive uropathy and renal insufficiency. Similarly, consider testing electrolytes for any signs of renal tubular dysfunction from an obstruction.

KEY FACT

BPH most commonly occurs in the central (periurethral) zone of the prostate and may not be detected on DRE.
======================================
Treatment Medical therapy:

Initial treatment: α-Blockers (eg, tamsulosin, terazosin), which relax smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck

Second-line medical treatment: 5α-Reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride), which inhibit the production of dihydrotestosterone

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or open, laparoscopic, or robotic “simple prostatectomy” is appropriate for patients with moderate to severe symptoms/complications (including renal insufficiency, recurrent UTIs, and bladder stones).

In case of bladder obstruction, urgent catheterization is necessary while awaiting more definitive management.

UROLOGIC CANCER

PROSTATE CANCER

The most common nonskin cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in males (after lung cancer). Risk factors include advanced age and a ⊕ family history.

KEY FACT

Leading causes of cancer death in men:

1. Lung cancer 2. Prostate cancer 3. Colorectal cancer 4. Pancreatic cancer

History/PE Usually asymptomatic but may present with obstructive urinary symptoms. Additional

presentations include constitutional symptoms, lymphedema (from metastases obstructing lymphatic drainage), and/or back pain (from bone metastases).

DRE that may reveal a palpable nodule or an area of induration (see Fig. 2.15-17). Early carcinoma is usually not detectable on exam.

FIGURE 2.15-17. Structure of the prostate. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Diagnosis Prostate cancer is suggested by clinical findings and/or a markedly ↑ PSA (>10 ng/mL) Most accurate test: Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy The physician should look for metastases with CT of the abdomen/pelvis and a bone scan

(metastatic lesions show an osteoblastic or ↑ bone density)

Treatment Watchful waiting may be the best approach for older adult patients with low-grade tumors,

as many cases of prostate cancer are slow to progress.

Radical prostatectomy is associated with ↑ risk for incontinence and/or ED. Radiation therapy (eg, brachytherapy or external beam) is associated with ↑ risk for

radiation proctitis and GI symptoms. Also associated with increased risk for ED posttreatment.

PSA, although controversial as a screening test, is used to follow a patient posttreatment to evaluate for disease recurrence.

The physician can treat metastatic disease with androgen ablation (eg, gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonists, orchiectomy, bicalutamide) and chemotherapy.

Radiation therapy is useful to manage bone pain from metastases after androgen ablation.
======================================
KEY FACT

An ↑ PSA can be caused by BPH, prostatitis, prostatic trauma, or carcinoma.

Prevention Screening guidelines remain controversial. Males should discuss the pros and cons of annual DRE and/or PSA testing starting at 50 years of age. Screening should begin earlier in Black males and in those with a first-degree relative with prostate cancer.

BLADDER CANCER

The second most common urologic cancer and the most frequent malignant tumor of the urinary tract; usually a transitional cell carcinoma—now called urothelial carcinoma (see Fig. 2.15-18). Most prevalent in males during the sixth and seventh decades. Risk factors include smoking, diets rich in meat and fat, schistosomiasis (squamous cell carcinoma), past treatment with cyclophosphamide, and occupational exposure to aniline dye.

NBI cystoscopy and bipolar electrosurgery in NMIBC management—an overview of daily practice. J Med Life. 2013;6[2]:140–145.

History/PE Gross, painless hematuria is the most common presenting symptom. Terminal hematuria

(end of voiding) suggests bleeding from the bladder.

Other urinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and dysuria, can also be seen, but most patients are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease.

years of age with unexplained hematuria. Urine cytology may show dysplastic cells. MRI, CT, and bone scan are important tools with which to define muscle invasion and

metastases.

Treatment Treatment depends on the extent of spread beyond the bladder mucosa.

Carcinoma in situ: Intravesicular chemotherapy or transurethral resection Superficial cancers: Complete transurethral resection or intravesicular chemotherapy

with mitomycin-C or Bacille Calmette-Guérin ([BCG], the TB vaccine)

Large, high-grade recurrent lesions: Intravesicular chemotherapy Invasive cancers without metastases: Radical cystectomy or radiation therapy for patients who are deemed poor candidates for radical cystectomy and for those with unresectable local disease. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy and radiosensitization is often considered.

Invasive cancers with distant metastases: Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and novel targeted agents are considered.
======================================
KEY FACT

A key step for diagnosis in an adult patient with unexplained hematuria is cystoscopy to evaluate for bladder cancer.

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA

An adenocarcinoma from tubular epithelial cells (∼80%–90% of all malignant tumors of the kidney). Tumors can spread along the renal vein to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and metastasize to other sites, eg, lung, bone, brain, and liver. Risk factors include male sex, smoking, obesity, acquired cystic kidney disease in ESRD, and certain genetic conditions, such as von Hippel–Lindau disease.

History/PE Presenting signs include gross hematuria, flank pain, scrotal varicoceles, and a palpable flank mass. Metastatic disease can present with weight loss and malaise. Paraneoplastic symptoms include anemia, erythropoiesis, thrombocytosis, fever, cachexia, hypercalcemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica.

KEY FACT

The classic triad of renal cell carcinoma consists of hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable flank mass, but only 5% to 10% present with all three components of the triad.

KEY FACT

history of smoking and (see Fig. 2.15-19) to

In a middle-aged individual with a history of smoking and a left-sided varicocele, consider renal cell carcinoma!

Diagnosis Best initial test: Diagnosed via CT (see Fig. 2.15-19) to characterize the renal mass and stage for lymph nodes/metastases. Ultrasonography rarely used. Diagnosis is then confirmed by histology on nephrectomy specimen.

FIGURE 2.15-19. Renal cell carcinoma. A contrast-enhanced CT through the abdomen demonstrates an enhancing exophytic mass (arrow) in the left kidney that proved on pathology to be renal cell carcinoma.

Treatment Surgical resection or thermal ablation may be curative in localized disease.

Metastasectomy may improve survival in metastatic disease.

Response rates from radiation or chemotherapy are only 15% to 30%. Newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (axitinib, lenvatnib, cabozatonib), which ↓ tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation, have shown promising results.
======================================
TESTICULAR CANCER

A heterogeneous group of neoplasms. About 95% of testicular tumors derive from germ cells, and virtually all are malignant. Risk factors include cryptorchidism, Klinefelter syndrome, and ⊕ family history. Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy in males 15 to 34 years of age.

History/PE Patients most often present with painless enlargement of the testes, a firm ovoid mass with

possible nodules, dull abdominal pain, and metastatic symptoms (lower back pain, dyspnea, cough and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy).

Most testicular cancers occur between 15 and 30 years of age, but seminomas have a peak incidence between 40 and 50 years of age.

Diagnosis Testicular ultrasonography CXR and CT of the abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for metastasis Tumor markers are useful for diagnosis and in monitoring treatment response (see Table

Microbiology UTIs most commonly result from ascending infection from the urethra → prostate

(prostatitis) → bladder (cystitis) → kidney (pyelonephritis) → systemic (urosepsis). Due to this “ascension,” these infections share common microbiologic profiles, as captured in Table 2.15-12.

Cystitis presents with dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, and WBCs (but not WBC casts) in urine. Primarily caused by ascension of microbes from urethra to bladder. Ascension to kidney results in pyelonephritis, which presents with fever, chills, flank pain, costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, hematuria, and WBC casts.

Ten times more common in females (shorter urethras colonized by fecal microbiota). Risk factors: Obstruction (eg, kidney stones, enlarged prostate), kidney surgery,

catheterization, congenital genitourinary (GU) malformation (eg, vesicoureteral reflux), diabetes, pregnancy.

Cultures: All patients should have urine cultures collected prior to empiric antibiotic therapy. Therapy is tailored based on cultures.

UA: Similar findings to uncomplicated simple cystitis (see earlier section) + WBC casts (infection in kidney → casts form as WBCs infiltrate tubules).

Imaging (CT, ultrasound): Reserved for patients at high risk for complications (a complicated UTI = complicated pyelonephritis) and treatment failure. Imaging examines anatomic causes + abscess formation + emphysematous pyelonephritis.

Complications Abscesses can form in the renal parenchyma and/or in the perirenal fat (perinephric

abscess). Patients who have persistent fever + abdominal pain despite adequate antibiotic treatment → CT/ultrasound imaging → diagnose abscess → drainage (all perinephric, >5 cm renal) + continued antibiotics.

Emphysematous pyelonephritis → caused by gas-producing bacteria (see Fig. 2.15- 21A), classically in patients with diabetes or immunocompromise.

Chronic pyelonephritis is caused by recurrent pyelonephritis (classically in children with with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) + obstruction in adults (recurrent kidney stones, BPH,

cervical carcinoma) → blunted calyces + corticomedullary scarring of the kidneys (seen on imaging, upper/lower pole scarring is characteristic of VUR). Pathologic examination → interstitial fibrosis + thyroidization of kidney (atrophic tubules filled with eosinophilic proteaceous materials, see Fig. 2.15-21B).

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a severe form of chronic pyelonephritis caused by infected kidney stone obstruction → granulomatous inflammation → multiple, dark round areas on CT (Bear Paw sign; see Fig. 2.15-21C).

Treatment Hemodynamically stable, can tolerate oral intake:

Outpatient care → fluroquinolones or third-/fourth-generation cephalosporin or TMP- SMX for 7 to 14 days

Overall, culture results, collected in ALL patients with pyelonephritis → treatment selection
======================================
All other patients (hemodynamically unstable, critically ill, urinary obstruction/prosthetics):

Inpatient care → parenteral antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluroquinolones—guided by local sensitivity patterns and culture results)

KEY FACT

achieve therapeutic parenchyma, so they OF COMPLICATED

Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin ONLY achieve therapeutic concentrations in the bladder + urine, and they do not penetrate renal parenchyma, so they should only be used to treat cystitis, not pyelonephritis.

PROSTATITIS: ONE FORM OF COMPLICATED UTI

Infection ascends from the urethra + reflux of infected urine → prostate (acute/chronic prostatitis). In both acute and chronic prostatitis, common UTI pathogens predominant (especially gram-negative E coli, which is still the most common). With acute bacterial prostatitis more common in younger males (age <40 years), high-risk sexual behaviors increase the risk of N gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is more common, occurs in older males (age 40–70 years), and may result from acute prostatitis.

History/PE Acute prostatitis classically presents with an ill appearance, including systemic symptoms

(fever + chills) + prostatitis symptoms (perineal pain + low back pain + pain with defecation) + irritative urinary symptoms (dysuria—burning pain when voiding) + frequency + urgency → urinary retention. DRE reveals an exquisitely tender + boggy prostrate. Prostatic massage must be avoided in acute bacterial prostatitis, as it can cause bacteremia. DRE can even be skipped, as the diagnosis can be made on clinical presentation alone.

Chronic prostatitis may be less symptomatic + patients do not appear ill + fever is usually absent. Patients may report prostatitis symptoms (dull, poorly localizable pain in the low back + perineal + scrotal + suprapubic regions) + recurrent urinary symptoms (dysuria + frequency + urgency + obstructive symptoms + ED ± bloody semen) with repeated

isolation of the same organism from urine cultures. DRE reveals an enlarged, nontender prostrate.

Diagnosis Acute prostatitis is confirmed by UA (sheets of WBCs + bacteriuria) + urine culture (E

coli is most commonly cultured). Obtain blood cultures in very ill-appearing or hemodynamically unstable patients.

Chronic prostatitis is suggested by the presence of WBCs in expressed prostatic secretions. Urine culture is ⊕ in chronic bacterial prostatitis and ⊖ in chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. The four-glass test can be used to determine the location of infection as secretions are cultured: first glass (initial urine = urethra sample), second glass (midstream urine = bladder sample), third glass (prostatic massage = prostate sample), fourth glass (after prostatic massage = another prostatic sample). Alternatively, the two-glass test can be used, which is simply glasses 3 and 4 in the previous test.

Treatment Acute prostatitis if severe, hospitalization + IV antibiotics (fluoroquinolone ± third- /fourth-generation cephalosporin). If mild, outpatient TMP-SMX or fluroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) for 4 to 6 weeks to achieve therapeutic levels in prostate. Men who engage in high-risk sexual activity should be considered for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis coverage (ceftriaxone + azithromycin or doxycycline).

or fluroquinolone levels in prostate: treated in pregnancy

Chronic prostatitis → TMP-SMX or fluroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) for 6

to 8 weeks → achieve therapeutic levels in prostate. Treatment is difficult; UTI recurrences are common.
======================================
KEY FACT

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is ONLY treated in pregnancy and before urologic surgery. Pyelonephritis develops in 20% to 30% of pregnant patients with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria.

KEY FACT

Prostatic massage is avoided in patients with acute bacterial prostatitis, as it can cause bacteremia. Digital rectal exam can even be skipped in the setting of a convincing clinical presentation.

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES

CHLAMYDIA

The most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States. Caused by C trachomatis, which can infect the genital tract, urethra, anus, and eye. Risk factors include unprotected sexual intercourse and new or multiple partners. Often coexists with or mimics N gonorrhoeae infection (known as nongonococcal urethritis when gonorrhea is absent). Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars of C trachomatis cause LGV, an

emerging cause of proctocolitis.

History/PE Infection is often asymptomatic in males and may present with urethritis, mucopurulent

cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women.

Exam may reveal cervical/adnexal tenderness in women or penile discharge and testicular tenderness in men.

The differential diagnosis includes gonorrhea, endometriosis, PID, orchitis, vaginitis, and UTI.

LGV presents in its primary form as a painless, transient papule or shallow ulcer. In its secondary form, it presents as painful swelling of the inguinal nodes, and in its tertiary form, it can present as an “anogenital syndrome” (anal pruritus with discharge, rectal strictures, rectovaginal fistula, and elephantiasis).

KEY FACT

Chlamydia species cause arthritis, neonatal conjunctivitis, pneumonia, nongonococcal urethritis/PID, and LGV.

probes and immunofluorescence (for gonorrhea/chlamydia) take 48 to 72 hours. A Gram stain of urethral or genital discharge may show polymorphonuclear (PMN)

leukocytes but no bacteria, as Chlamydia is an intracellular organism.

Treatment Doxycycline for 7 days or azithromycin once. Pregnant patients should take azithromycin

or amoxicillin.

Treatment of sexual partners. The physician should maintain a low threshold to also treat for concurrent N gonorrhoeae, as they often coexist. LGV serovars require prolonged therapy for 21 days.

Complications Chronic infection and pelvic pain, Reiter syndrome (urethritis, conjunctivitis, arthritis),

Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome (perihepatic inflammation and fibrosis). See Figures 2.15-22 and 2.15-23.

Ectopic pregnancy/infertility can result from PID (in women) and epididymitis (in men).
======================================
GONORRHEA

An infection caused by a gram ⊝ intracellular diplococcus that can infect almost any site in the female reproductive tract. Infection in males tends to be limited to the urethra.

History/PE Presents with a greenish-yellow discharge, pelvic or adnexal pain, and swollen Bartholin

glands. Men experience a purulent urethral discharge, dysuria, and erythema of the urethral meatus.

The differential diagnosis includes chlamydia, endometriosis, pharyngitis, PID, vaginitis, UTI, salpingitis, and tubo-ovarian abscess.

Diagnosis Gold standard: Gram stain and culture for any site (pharynx, cervix, urethra, or anus).

» Gold standard: Gram stain and culture for any site (pharynx, cervix, urethra, or anus). Nucleic acid amplification tests can be sent on penile/vaginal tissue or from urine.

Nucleic acid amplification tests can be sent on penile/vaginal tissue or from urine. Disseminated disease may present with monoarticular septic arthritis, rash, and/or

tenosynovitis. See Figures 2.15-24 and 2.15-25.

FIGURE 2.15-25. Neisseria gonorrhoeae joint infection. (Reproduced courtesy of US Department of Health and Human Services and Emory.)

Treatment Intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone and oral (PO) azithromycin (regardless of whether chlamydia is present). Condoms are effective prophylaxis. The sexual partner or partners should be treated if possible. Fluoroquinolones should not be used because of emerging resistance.

Disseminated disease requires IV ceftriaxone for at least 24 hours.

KEY FACT

Treat gonorrhea with two agents because of the high prevalence of resistance.

Complications Persistent infection with pain; infertility; tubo-ovarian abscess with rupture; disseminated gonococcal infection (characterized by migratory polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and pustular skin lesions) (see Fig. 2.15-25).

Secondary (4–8 weeks after chancre): Presents with low-grade fever, headache, malaise, and generalized lymphadenopathy with a diffuse, symmetric, asymptomatic (nonpruritic) maculopapular rash on the soles and palms (see Figs. 2.15-26C and D). Highly infective secondary eruptions include mucus patches called condylomata lata (see Fig. 2.15-26E) and alopecia. Meningitis, hepatitis, nephropathy, and eye involvement may also be seen.

Early latent (period from resolution of primary or secondary syphilis to the end of the first year of infection): No symptoms; ⊕ serology.

Late latent (period of asymptomatic infection beyond the first year): No symptoms; ⊕ or ⊝ serology. One third of cases progress to tertiary syphilis.

Tertiary (late manifestations appearing 1–20 years after initial infection): Presents with destructive, granulomatous gummas (see Fig. 2.15-26F). Neurosyphilis includes tabes dorsalis (posterior column degeneration), meningitis, and Argyll Robertson pupil (constricts with accommodation but not reactive to light). Cardiovascular findings include dilated aortic root, aortitis, aortic root aneurysms, and aortic regurgitation.

KEY FACT

Syphilis is the “great imitator” because its dermatologic findings resemble those of many other diseases.

KEY FACT

Treatment of syphilis can result in an acute flulike illness (headache, fever, chills, myalgias) known as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which results from the release of endotoxins by the killed organisms.

Primary/secondary: Benzathine penicillin IM for one dose. Tetracycline or doxycycline for 14 days may be used for patients with penicillin allergy. Pregnant patients who are penicillin allergic and have ⊕ antibody titers must be desensitized and treated with penicillin.

Latent infection: Treatment with benzathine penicillin. The physician should give one dose for early latent infection or a weekly dose for 3 weeks for late latent infection or for asymptomatic infection of unknown duration.

Neurosyphilis: Treatment with penicillin IV for 10 to 14 days. Penicillin-allergic patients should be desensitized before therapy.

KEY FACT

Genital lesions caused by Haemophilus ducreyi (“do cry”) and herpes lesions are painful. Syphilis and the others are painless.

KEY FACT

Regarding a patient with a nonhealing ulcerative lesion and inguinal lymphadenopathy with a ⊝ workup for a sexually transmitted infection (STI), think cancer.

Heart rate is the first vital sign to change in hemorrhagic shock. Blood pressure (BP) falls only after ≥1.5 L (30%–40% of blood volume) of blood loss.

FEVER

POSTOPERATIVE FEVER

Occurs in 40% of all postoperative patients. Timing after surgery determines the most likely cause (Fig. 2.16-1). Fever before day 3 is rarely of infectious origin. Table 2.16-2 summarizes the most common etiologies, based on postoperative day (POD) of onset.

KEY FACT

Endometritis is an additional cause of postoperative fever after C-section. Onset occurs anytime from POD 2 to 10.

KEY FACT

Immediate fever after administration of halothane or succinylcholine should raise concern for malignant hyperthermia. Assess for rigidity, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte derangements. Treat with dantrolene and active cooling.

FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN

A temperature >38.3°C (100.9°F) of at least 3 weeks’ duration that remains undiagnosed following three outpatient visits or 1 week of hospitalization.
======================================
KEY FACT

Overall, infections and cancer account for the majority (60%) of cases of fever of unknown origin. Autoimmune diseases account for ∼15%. In older adults, rheumatic diseases account for one third of cases.

History/PE Presents with fever. May complain of headache, myalgia, and malaise. The differential diagnosis includes the following:

Infectious: Tuberculosis (TB), endocarditis (eg, HACEK organisms; see the Infective

Endocarditis section in the Cardiovascular chapter), occult abscess (abdominal, prostatic), osteomyelitis, catheter infections, sinusitis. In HIV patients, consider Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), histoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Neoplastic: Lymphomas, leukemias, hepatic and renal cell carcinomas. Autoimmune: Still disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cryoglobulinemia, polyarteritis nodosa, connective tissue disease, granulomatous disease (including sarcoidosis).

Miscellaneous: Pulmonary emboli/deep venous thrombosis (DVT), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), alcoholic hepatitis, drug fever, familial Mediterranean fever, factitious fever.

Idiopathic (10%–15%).

Diagnosis Confirm the presence of fever and take a detailed history, including family, social, sexual,

occupational, dietary, exposures (pets/animals), and travel.

sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP); serum protein electrophoresis; multiple blood cultures (similar to osteomyelitis workup); sputum Gram stain and culture; urinalysis (UA) and culture; and purified protein derivative (PPD). Complete appropriate cancer screening. Specific tests (antinuclear antibody [ANA], rheumatoid factor [RF], creatine kinase [CK], viral cultures, viral serologies/antigen tests) can be obtained if an infectious or autoimmune etiology is suspected.

Imaging: Obtain a x-ray of the chest (CXR). CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be done early in the workup of a true fever of unknown origin (FUO). Invasive testing (marrow/liver biopsy) is generally low yield. Nuclear medicine and laparoscopy are higher yield as second-line tests (after CT).

Case by case: Consider serologic testing for less common etiologies like Brucella spp., Coxiella spp., and Bartonella spp.

Treatment Stop unnecessary medications. Remove indwelling lines or other potential sources of infection. Patients with FUO who have a completely ⊝ workup have a favorable prognosis, with fevers resolving over months to years.
======================================
SEPSIS

Sepsis is defined by organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is essentially sepsis with associated profound metabolic, cellular, and circulatory disturbances that confer an increased risk of mortality.

History/PE Sepsis can be identified when there are signs of organ dysfunction in the setting of known

or suspected infection. Clinical tools such as the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) or “quick” SOFA scores help identify and characterize dysfunction of several organ systems by noting the presence of tachycardia, altered mental status, and hypotension, among other findings.

Septic shock is typically a “warm” shock, with warm skin and extremities. This contrasts

with cardiogenic shock, which typically presents with cool skin and extremities. Petechiae, ecchymoses, and/or abnormal coagulation tests suggest disseminated

intravascular coagulation (DIC; 2%–3% of cases).

Diagnosis Laboratory results frequently show leukocytosis or leukopenia with ↑ bands,

thrombocytopenia (50% of cases), evidence of ↓ tissue perfusion (↑ creatinine, ↑ liver function tests [LFTs], ↑ lactate), and abnormal coagulation studies (↑ international normalized ratio [INR]). Hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mm Hg or persistently elevated lactate (>2 mEq/L) despite adequate fluid resuscitation diagnoses septic shock.

It is critical to obtain cultures of all appropriate sites (eg, blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], wound, urine). Obtaining cultures should not delay antibiotic administration.

Imaging (CXR, CT) may aid in establishing the etiology or site of infection.

Treatment Intensive care unit (ICU) admission may be required. Treat aggressively with empiric

may be required»Treat source of infection). should be used as end-organ perfusion. remove urinary catheter or INFECTIONS

antibiotics (based on the likely source of infection). Volume resuscitation with intravenous (IV) crystalloid and vasopressors should be used as needed to maintain adequate MAP (>65 mm Hg) and optimize end-organ perfusion.

Treat underlying factors (eg, remove urinary catheter or infected lines, drain abscesses).
======================================
HEMATOLOGIC INFECTIONS

MALARIA

A protozoal disease caused by five species of the genus Plasmodium (P falciparum, P vivax, P ovale, P malariae, P knowlesi) and transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. P falciparum has the highest morbidity and mortality, occasionally within 24 hours of symptom onset. Travelers to endemic areas should take chemoprophylaxis and use mosquito repellent and bed nets to minimize exposure.

History/PE Patients have a history of exposure in a malaria-endemic area, with periodic attacks of sequential chills, fever (up to 41°C [105.8°F]), myalgias, headache, and diaphoresis occurring over 4 to 6 hours.

Splenomegaly often appears 4 or more days after symptom onset. Patients are often asymptomatic between attacks, which recur every 2 to 3 days, depending on the Plasmodium species involved.

Severely ill patients may present with hyperpyrexia, prostration, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, acidosis, hyperventilation, and bleeding. The presence of a rash, skin ulcer, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, neck stiffness, or photophobia suggests a different

or additional diagnosis.

Diagnosis Timely diagnosis of the correct species is essential because P falciparum can be fatal and

is often resistant to standard chloroquine treatment.

The physician should send Giemsa- or Wright-stained thick and thin blood films for evaluation to detect Plasmodium and determine the species type, respectively, and the degree of parasitemia (see Fig. 2.16-2).

FIGURE 2.16-2. Plasmodium falciparum hyperparasitemia in the thin smear of a patient with cerebral malaria. (Reproduced with permission from the US Department of Health and Human Services and Steven Glenn.)

normochromic, normocytic disease. serologic tests are antibody methods, and status, the physician should

CBC usually demonstrates normochromic, normocytic anemia, with reticulocytosis and thrombocytopenia early in the disease.

If resources allow, more sensitive serologic tests are available, including rapid antigen

detection methods, fluorescent antibody methods, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In patients with altered mental status, the physician should obtain a fingerstick glucose to

rule out hypoglycemia.
======================================
KEY FACT

Cerebral malaria presents with headache, altered mental status, neurologic signs, retinal hemorrhages, convulsions, and delirium. If left untreated, it can rapidly progress to coma and death.

Treatment Uncomplicated malarial infection can be treated with oral agents. Chloroquine has

historically been the standard antimalarial medication, but high resistance rates often necessitate the use of other medications such as mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil, or artemisinins (for severe cases).

In cases of P vivax, P ovale, or an unknown species, primaquine is added to eradicate the hypnozoites in the liver.

For patients traveling to endemic regions, the physician should prescribe prophylaxis consisting of atovaquone-proguanil or mefloquine given at least 2 weeks before travel and continued for 4 weeks after returning.

KEY FACT

Antimalarial contraindications: Primaquine: Requires testing for G6PD first Mefloquine: Seizure, psychiatric conditions, and cardiac conduction disorders Atovaquone/proguanil: Pregnancy/breastfeeding, renal disease Chloroquine: Psoriasis

Complications Cerebral malaria, severe hemolytic anemia, renal impairment, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, acute hepatopathy, and gram ⊝ bacteremia.

OTHER MOSQUITO-BORNE VIRUSES

The following viruses are carried by the Aedes mosquito and present with rash, fever, and myalgias:

Chikungunya: Notably causes joint pain. Supportive care is the treatment. Dengue (“breakbone fever”): Presents with bone pain and can be complicated by severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and shock. Findings of low WBCs and ↑ LFTs. Treatment calls for fluids and blood products as needed.

Zika: Flavivirus that causes conjunctivitis and headache. Associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. It can cause microcephaly of the fetus if the patient is infected during pregnancy. Treatment is supportive care.

of the fetus if the care. INFECTIONS

TICK-BORNE INFECTIONS

LYME DISEASE

A tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Usually seen during the summer months and carried by Ixodes ticks on white-tailed deer and white-footed mice. Endemic to the Northeast, northern Midwest, and Pacific coast.
======================================
KEY FACT

Ehrlichiosis is a disease transmitted by the lone star tick endemic to the south-central and southeastern United States. It causes headache, fever, chills, altered mental status, and myalgias, but rash is uncommon. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and ↑ liver enzymes are common laboratory findings. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice.

History/PE Presents at the onset of rash with fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias, and/or

arthralgias. Infection usually occurs after a tick feeds for >36 hours.

Primary (early localized disease): Erythema migrans begins as a small erythematous macule or papule that is found at the tick-feeding site and expands slowly over days to weeks. The border may be macular or raised, often with central clearing (“bull’s-eye”; see Fig. 2.16-3).

FIGURE 2.16-3. Erythema chronicum migrans seen in Lyme disease. Note the classic “bull’s-eye” lesion, which consists of an outer ring where the spirochetes are found, an inner ring of clearing, and central erythema caused by an allergic response at the site of the tick bite. (Reproduced with permission from the US Department of Health and Human Services and James Gathany.)

of an outer ring where caused by an allergic US Department of Health and disease): Presents with nerve.palsy; bilateral myocarditis, and conduction

Secondary (early disseminated disease): Presents with migratory polyarthropathies, neurologic phenomena (eg, facial nerve palsy; bilateral is classic for Lyme disease), lymphocytic meningitis and/or myocarditis, and conduction abnormalities (third-degree heart block).

Tertiary (late disease): Arthritis and subacute encephalitis (memory loss and mood change).

Diagnosis Early Lyme disease is diagnosed on clinical presentation alone (erythema migrans +

endemic area). Serologic tests are not required or recommended, as IgM becomes ⊕ 1 to 2 weeks, and IgG 2 to 6 weeks, after onset of erythema migrans.

Early disseminated or late Lyme disease presenting with consistent symptoms and exposure risk factors should be diagnosed with serology. If enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgM and IgG are ⊕ or equivocal, then Western blot can be used for confirmation. Western blot should not be used for “screening” or nonspecific symptoms. Western blots sent without ELISA have high false ⊕ rates.

Treatment If the tick is still attached, remove it with forceps and thoroughly disinfect the area. Treat early disease with doxycycline (or amoxicillin in pregnant patients). Short courses of doxycycline may be used in young patients. More advanced disease (eg, central nervous system [CNS], cardiac, or arthritic disease) should be treated with ceftriaxone.

Consider empiric therapy for patients with the characteristic rash, arthralgias, or a tick bite acquired in an endemic area. Prevent with tick bite avoidance.

Prophylaxis: Give one dose of doxycycline if all of the following apply: tick is Ixodes scapularis and has been attached for ≥36 hours, prophylaxis is started ≤72 hours of removal, patient has no contraindications to doxycycline, and local rate of infection of ticks with B burgdorferi is >20%. If criteria are not met, observe and treat only if erythema migrans develops.
======================================
KEY FACT

“Tick testing” is a common incorrect answer choice; it has no effect on management and is not performed in a Lyme disease workup.

BABESIOSIS

Tick-borne protozoal illness also transmitted by I scapularis (high rate of coinfection with Lyme disease). Causes flulike symptoms, intravascular hemolysis, anemia, and jaundice. Ring-shaped or “Maltese cross” organisms may be seen on blood smear. Can become severe if risk factors are present (eg, asplenia, immunocompromise, or malignancy). Treat with oral azithromycin (IV if severe) and atovaquone.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER

A disease caused by Rickettsia rickettsii and carried by the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). Cases are most common during June and July and in Midwestern and Eastern states (Arkansas, Missouri, Virginia, and North Carolina). The organism invades the endothelial lining of capillaries and causes small vessel vasculitis.

Hx/PE: Presents with headache, fever, malaise, and rash. The characteristic rash is initially macular (beginning on the wrists and ankles) but becomes petechial/purpuric as it spreads centrally (see Fig. 2.16-4). Altered mental status or DIC may develop in severe cases.

FIGURE 2.16-4. Rocky Mountain spotted fever. These erythematous macular lesions will evolve into a petechial rash that will spread centrally. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K, Johnson RA, Saavedra AP. Fitzpatrick’s Color Atlas & Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology, 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw- Hill; 2013.)

Dx: Clinical diagnosis should be confirmed with biopsy and indirect immunofluorescence of the skin lesion.

Tx: Empiric therapy with doxycycline. The condition can be rapidly fatal if left untreated. If clinical suspicion is high, treatment should begin while awaiting testing. Chloramphenicol can be used during the first two trimesters of pregnancy in uncomplicated cases, but if it is not available, doxycycline therapy should be initiated.
======================================
KEY FACT

Rocky Mountain spotted fever starts on the wrists and ankles and then spreads centrally.

INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS

Most commonly occurs in young adult patients; usually caused by acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Transmission most often occurs through exchange of body fluids, most commonly saliva.

History/PE Presents with fever and pharyngitis. Fatigue invariably accompanies initial the illness and

may persist for 3 to 6 months. Examination may reveal low-grade fever, generalized lymphadenopathy (especially posterior cervical), tonsillar exudate and enlargement, palatal petechiae, a generalized maculopapular rash, splenomegaly, and bilateral upper eyelid edema. Symptoms appear 2 to 5 weeks after infection.

posterior cervical), tonsillar maculopapular rash, 2 to 5 weeks after may cause mesenteric as their primary (30%.of patients with

In older children and adults, it may cause mesenteric lymphadenitis, mimicking appendicitis.

Patients who present with pharyngitis as their primary symptom may be misdiagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis (30% of patients with infectious mononucleosis are asymptomatic carriers of group A streptococcus [GAS] in their oropharynx).

The differential diagnosis includes CMV, toxoplasmosis, HIV, human herpesvirus (HHV) 6, other causes of viral hepatitis, and lymphoma.

Diagnosis Best initial test: Heterophile antibody (Monospot) test. It may be ⊝ in the first few weeks

after symptoms begin.

An EBV-specific antibody test can be ordered in patients with suspected mononucleosis and a ⊝ Monospot test. Infectious mononucleosis syndromes with a ⊝ Monospot test and ⊝ EBV antibody are most often caused by CMV infection. Acute HIV and other viral etiologies should be considered.

CBC with differential often reveals mild thrombocytopenia with relative lymphocytosis and >10% atypical T lymphocytes.

A comprehensive metabolic panel usually reveals mildly elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.

KEY FACT

Lymphocytosis in EBV infection is predominantly caused by B-cell proliferation, but the atypical cells are T lymphocytes.

Treatment Treatment is supportive, as there is no effective antiviral therapy. Corticosteroids are indicated for airway compromise caused by tonsillar enlargement, severe thrombocytopenia, or severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Complications CNS infection: Can present as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis,

cranial nerve palsies (particularly cranial nerve [CN] VII), optic and peripheral neuritis, transverse myelitis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Splenic rupture: Occurs in <0.5% of cases. More common in males. Presents with abdominal pain, referred left shoulder pain, and/or hemodynamic compromise. Patients should avoid contact sports for at least 4 weeks to prevent this complication.

Upper airway obstruction: Treatment with steroids. Bacterial superinfection: Can lead to development of a secondary streptococcal

pharyngitis.

Fulminant hepatic necrosis: More common in males; the most common cause of death in affected males.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Occurs in 2% of patients during the first 2 weeks.

======================================
KEY FACT

Patients with mononucleosis who are given ampicillin for suspected streptococcal pharyngitis may develop a prolonged, pruritic maculopapular rash.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS

A positive-sense diploid RNA genome retrovirus that preferentially targets and destroys CD4+ T cells, leading to immunosuppression (see Fig. 2.16-5). Transmission occurs via any activity that shares infected body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal fluids). Receptive anal sex without condom use has the greatest risk of transmission due to tearing of anal mucosa + sharing of bodily fluids. Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for the greatest number of new HIV diagnoses in the United States, with disproportionately higher rates among Black MSM. Worldwide, however, heterosexual transmission accounts for the greatest number of cases.

Reverse transcriptase synthesizes double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from genomic RNA; dsDNA integrates into host genome.

Virus binds CD4 as well as a coreceptor, either CCR5 on macrophages (early infection) or CXCR4 on T cells (late infection).

Homozygous CCR5 mutation = immunity. Heterozygous CCR5 mutation = slower course.

TRANSMISSION

HIV can be transmitted both vertically (mother to child) and horizontally (through sexual intercourse and contaminated blood) (Table 2.16-3).

FIGURE 2.16-6. Time course of HIV infection. Note that the level of CD4+ cells remains normal for many years but then declines, resulting in the immunodeficiency stage, which is characterized by opportunistic infections and malignancies. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE- Rx.com.)

Acute HIV: Initial infection is asymptomatic in 10% to 60% of cases. If symptomatic, the acute HIV syndrome occurs 2 to 4 weeks after exposure and presents as a mononucleosis- type syndrome (suspect HIV in person with sexually transmitted infection [STI] risk factors) and/or a flulike syndrome. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, maculopapular rash, headache, painful mucocutaneous ulcers, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Notably, the viral RNA load is elevated, but seroconversion has not yet occurred (antibodies nonreactive).

Chronic (clinically latent) HIV: Can be asymptomatic for a period of 8 to 10 years. Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy may be present along with fatigue. Notably, Candida infections of thrush or vaginitis in a patient with risk factors for STIs should raise clinical suspicion for HIV (see Fig. 2.16-7). Seborrheic dermatitis is also a common finding in this stage. Overall, the CD4+ T-cell count progressively declines over multiple years in this phase. The latency of this phase is why screening is recommended (see later diagnosis section).

AIDS: The average time, in the absence of treatment, from exposure → AIDS is 8 years. Defined as a CD4+ T-cell count <200/mm3 or an AIDS-defining infection. Clinical presentations vary and are due to opportunistic infections.

Dashed lines on CD4+ cell count axis indicate moderate immunocompromise (<400 CD4+

cells/mm3) and when AIDS-defining illnesses emerge (<200 CD4+ cells/mm3). Most patients who do not receive treatment eventually die of complications of HIV

infection.

Four stages of untreated infection:

1. Flulike (acute) 2. Feeling fine (latent) 3. Falling count 4. Final crisis

Confirmatory test: HIV-1/2 differentiation immunoassay (preferred over Western blot). HIV type guides treatment. HIV-1: More common and found worldwide. HIV-2: Mainly in West Africa.

Special testing scenarios:

Early acute HIV: A combination test (may not be ⊕ until ∼2 weeks postinfection) AND a viral RNA load (PCR-RNA)

Perinatal HIV: Maternal HIV antibodies (Abs) → newborn (cannot use Ab tests); use nucleic acid tests

AIDS: HIV and one or more of the following:

CD4+ T-cell count <200/mm3 CD4+ T-cell percentage of total lymphocytes <14% AIDS-defining illness

Screening Indications:

One-time screening with a combined test for all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 64 years Annual screening for high-risk patients: IV drug users and partners, sex workers, sex

partners of HIV ⊕ people or high-risk partners, MSM

patients: IV drug users high-risk partners, MSM with new STIs, IN HIV of past infections (eg,

Routine prenatal screening, people with new STIs, exposure to possibly infected body fluids

OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN HIV PATIENTS

↓ CD4+ cell count → reactivation of past infections (eg, TB, herpes simplex virus [HSV], shingles), dissemination of bacterial infections and opportunistic fungal infections (eg, coccidioidomycosis), and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (Table 2.16-4). The risk of OIs in HIV ⊕ adults directly correlates with the CD4+ cell count (Fig. 2.16-9).

MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION OF HIV

ART:

Lifelong ART is prescribed for all HIV ⊕ patients, even during pregnancy, regardless of CD4+ cell count. Counseling about strict (100%) adherence is crucial, as minor regimen deviations → resistance.

Viral resistance testing (genotyping) should be performed prior to ART initiation AND if there is evidence of treatment failure (see viral load information). Both enable a more tailored regimen to be prescribed.

Viral load (PCR-RNA) and CD4+ T-cell count are measured at time of diagnosis and then every 3 to 4 months.

Monitoring viral load (PCR-RNA levels) serves two main purposes:

Measures response to therapy: ↑ or >50/μL (after 4 months of treatment) viral RNA = evaluation for regimen change; ↓/undetectable (treatment goal defined as <20/μL) viral RNA = continue therapy

Assesses treatment as prevention: Undetectable (goal <20/μL) viral RNA = ↓↓↓↓ transmission risk

Initial regimens generally consist of two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus one integrase inhibitor (which are superior to, but can be substituted by, a non-nucleoside RTI [NNRTI] or protease inhibitor, depending on the specific patient’s needs). Triple-drug ART regimens are referred to as highly active

antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Used to prevent viral resistance. See Figure 2.16-10 for targets of therapy and Table 2.16-5 for drug classes, agents, mechanisms of action, and adverse effects.

======================================
IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME

Starting HIV treatment can lead to a flare-up of infectious symptoms lasting weeks to months, despite ↓ viral loads and ↑ CD4+ T cells. As the immune system becomes reconstituted (↑ CD4+ T cells) due to ART, known or unknown OIs may be present and flare up. Therefore, although treatment with HAART regimens should begin as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, it may be delayed to first treat an OI (especially Cryptococcus).

PROPHYLAXIS FOR OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND VACCINATIONS

OIs are infections that are more common and/or more severe in advanced HIV ⊕ patients. The best prevention against OIs consists of HAART regimens that maintain CD4+ T-cell counts. Figure 2.16-11 provides a guide to prophylactic treatment against OIs.

Live vaccines are contraindicated if CD4+ T-cell counts <200/mm3. Live vaccines such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); zoster; and varicella may be considered in those with less immunosuppression (higher CD4+ T-cell counts). Administration depends on the patient’s age, overall health, and other specific features.

Other standard vaccines should be administered and include pneumococcal, meningococcal, COVID-19, hepatitis A/B, and more.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP):

Indication: High-risk HIV ⊝ patient (intravenous drug user [IVDU], MSM, sex worker, HIV ⊕ sex partner)

Regimen: Tenofovir-emtricitabine taken as long as indication listed is met. PrEP is 99% and 74% effective in reducing HIV infection from sex and IV drug use, respectively. Notably, the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) formulation is more associated with kidney injury and bone loss vs the tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF-FTC) formulation.
======================================
Post-exposure prophylaxis:

Indications:

High-risk sexual contact: Condomless sex in area with ↑ HIV prevalence with MSM and/or sex workers. Recent sexual exposure to known HIV carrier.

Exposure to needles: IV drug use with sharing of needles; healthcare worker with needlestick injury characterized by (1) exposure to potentially infective bodily fluids (blood, blood-containing fluids, bites from HIV ⊕ person, breast milk, semen, vaginal fluids) AND (2) exposure of nonintact skin and/or mucous membranes

Regimens: ART ↓ likelihood of infection. A combination of three drugs is prescribed (eg, tenofovir-emtricitabine + integrase inhibitor) for 28 days. HIV testing occurs with a combination test at the start of the process and at both 6 weeks and 3 months postexposure.

Prevention of perinatal transmission:

approach. All HIV ⊕ pregnant patients should be receiving ART. If HIV ⊕ pregnant patient is already on effective ART, the physician should continue that regimen to prevent perinatal transmission. If the patient is treatment naïve and newly diagnosed HIV ⊕, the physician should not wait for genotyping but start ART immediately. Therapies consist of two NRTIs and an integrase inhibitor or protease inhibitor.

At the time of delivery:

If the viral RNA load <100 copies/mL and HIV ⊕ pregnant patient is on ART → vaginal delivery is recommended, and IV intrapartum zidovudine is not routinely administered.

If viral RNA load >1000 copies/mL → C-section is recommended, and IV intrapartum zidovudine is routinely administered.

Newborn therapy:

If viral RNA load in the pregnant patient at the time of delivery <50 copies/mL → prescribe zidovudine to newborn for 4 to 6 weeks postbirth.

If viral RNA load in the pregnant patient at the time of delivery >50 copies/mL → prescribe ART with two to three drug regimens to the newborn.

KEY FACT

tenofovir-emtricitabine can be given to high-risk partners).

Pre-exposure prophylaxis with tenofovir-emtricitabine can be up to 99% effective in reducing HIV infection and should be given to high-risk patients (IVDUs, MSMs, sex workers, those with HIV-⊕ sex partners).
======================================
KEY FACT

Onn

If a patient presents with a mononucleosis-like syndrome or flulike illness with a history that places them at an increased risk for STIs, consider screening for HIV.

KEY FACT

Lifelong antiretroviral therapy should be prescribed to all HIV ⊕ patients, even during pregnancy, regardless of CD4+ T-cell count.

CYTOMEGALOVIRUS

Seventy percent of adults in the United States have been infected with CMV, and most are asymptomatic; reactivation generally occurs in immunocompromised patients, particularly in the setting of organ transplantation.

Transmission occurs via sexual contact, vertical transmission, breast milk, respiratory droplets in nursery or daycare facilities, and blood transfusions.

Risk factors for reactivation include tissue or bone marrow transplant (first 100 days) and HIV/AIDS (CD4+ cell count <50/mm3 or viral load >10,000 copies/mL).

History/PE Systemic infection may resemble EBV mononucleosis (see the discussion on infectious mononucleosis). Specific manifestations include the following:

CMV retinitis: Associated with retinal detachment (“pizza pie” retinopathy with white, fluffy, perivascular lesions). CMV retinitis presents with floaters and visual field changes (CD4+ cell count <50/mm3).

GI and hepatobiliary involvement: Can present with multiple nonspecific GI symptoms, including bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. CMV, microsporidia, and Cryptosporidium have been implicated in the development of AIDS cholangiopathy.

CMV esophagitis: Typically presents with odynophagia and shallow ulcers on the distal esophagus (CD4+ cell count <50/mm3).

CMV pneumonitis: Presents with cough, fever, and sparse sputum production; associated with a high mortality rate. CMV pneumonitis is much more common in patients with hematologic malignancies and transplant patients than in those with AIDS.

CNS involvement: Can include polyradiculopathy, transverse myelitis, and subacute encephalitis (CD4+ cell count <50/mm3; periventricular calcifications).

Diagnosis Virus isolation, culture, histopathology (gold standard for tissue-invasive disease), serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

or foscarnet. Treat LINE-ASSOCIATED

Treatment Treat with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or foscarnet. Treat underlying disease if the patient is immunocompromised.
======================================
CENTRAL LINE–ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS

Also called catheter-related bloodstream infections, central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLASBIs) are laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infections not related to an infection at a different body site that develop within 48 hours of central line placement. Catheter-related sepsis almost always occurs with central IV catheters—peripheral venous/arterial catheters are rarely implicated. Notable risk factors include emergent placement, line placement site (femoral > jugular > subclavian), type of central line (nontunneled catheter > tunneled catheter), high-risk patient factors (eg, immunosuppression), and prolonged use. CLASBIs are associated with the greatest cost burden of nosocomial infections (∼$46,000/case). Prevention guidelines must be followed.

Microorganisms causing CLASBIs: Gram ⊕ bacteria (40%–80% of cases: coagulase ⊝ Staphylococci [most common overall cause] > Enterococci > Staphylococcus aureus); gram ⊝ bacteria (20%–30% of cases: Klebsiella > Enterobacter > Pseudomonas > Escherichia coli > Acinetobacter); and fungi (11.8% of cases: Candida spp.)

History/PE Nontunneled catheter: Only 50% of patients have evidence of infection (erythema,

purulence) at the site of placement. High clinical suspicion is needed in a patient with a nontunneled central line who develops systemic features of infection such as fever/chills

(most common), altered mental status, hypotension, and fatigue.

Tunneled catheter: In addition to systemic features of infection, the exit site and subcutaneous portions of the line need examination/palpation to evaluate for inflammation (discharge, pain).

Diagnosis Best initial test: Paired blood culture (one sample each from a peripheral vein and a

central line) along with a CBC, serum electrolytes, and renal/liver function tests to assess for severity of infection and comorbidities.

Nontunneled catheter: Requires one of the following: (1) isolation of same organism

from a central line AND peripheral vein blood sample with a greater concentration of the organism in the central line culture; (2) isolation of the same organism from the catheter tip (>15 colony-forming units [CFUs]) and peripheral vein blood sample; and (3) shorter time to positive culture (>2 hours earlier) in central line vs peripheral vein sample. Tunneled catheter: Diagnosis requiring inflammation beyond 2 cm from the exit site, typically with pain and tenderness along the subcutaneous tract of the line, with the presence of exudate that becomes culture ⊕.

Management Antibiotic therapy: Empiric therapy should be immediately started. Do NOT wait for cultures if doing so delays antibiotic administration. With the majority of infections caused by gram ⊕/⊖ organisms, coverage is needed for both, taking into account local susceptibility patterns (eg, methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA] coverage), Pseudomonas coverage, and possibly fungal coverage (depending on patient characteristics). Once culture results are available, tailor therapy.

coverage is needed for methicillin-resistant S aureus possibly fungal coverage results are available, tailor Nontunneled.catheters should lines can only be salvaged exit site infections

Catheter removal/salvage: Nontunneled catheters should be promptly removed (limited salvage scenarios). Nontunneled lines can only be salvaged in uncomplicated (eg, no endocarditis/metastatic infection) exit site infections with topical/systemic antibiotic therapy. All tunneled catheter infections require catheter removal.
======================================
THERMAL DYSREGULATION

HYPOTHERMIA

Body temperature <35°C (<95°F) defines hypothermia. Shivering usually begins at <35°C (<95°F). Patients stop shivering at <32°C (89.6°F) and develop confusion, lethargy, and possibly cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with a body temperature <28°C (82.4°F) are usually comatose.

Etiology Heat loss: Cold environment (most common), burns, trauma Impaired heat production: Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypoglycemia Impaired regulation: Spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular accident

Management Directed at correcting body temperature regardless of etiology.

Remove the patient from the cold or windy environment and remove wet clothing. Direct

warming method on severity of hypothermia:

32° to 35°C: Passive external rewarming. Remove wet clothing and cover with blankets or other insulation.

28° to 32°C: Active external rewarming. Use warm blankets, warm water bath, or forced warm air-blanket system.

<28°C: Active internal rewarming. Use warm IV fluids, warm peritoneal/pleural lavage,

or extracorporeal rewarming such as hemodialysis or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Use a warm water bath to thaw frostbite. Patients will need narcotic analgesia for thawing. Monitor the ECG for arrhythmias such as bradycardia and slow atrial fibrillation, which can be common at <30°C (86°F). The classic sign is the J wave (Osborn wave): a positive elevation at the J point, just at the end of the QRS complex.

Monitor and aggressively replace fluids. Monitor electrolytes and acid-base balance. Do not stop resuscitation efforts until the patient has been warmed.

KEY FACT

A patient is not dead until they are warm and dead. The physician cannot pronounce death until the body is rewarmed to 32°C, unless serum K+ is ≥12 mEq/L.

defines hyperthermia. neuroleptic malignant

HYPERTHERMIA

Body temperature >40°C (104°F) defines hyperthermia.

Etiology Exposure: Malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), poisoning, overdose, withdrawal syndrome, environmental (heat, classically an athlete or military recruit)

Infectious: Sepsis, meningitis/encephalitis, tetanus, typhoid, malaria Endocrine: Thyroid storm, pheochromocytoma, diabetic ketoacidosis Neurologic: Hypothalamic stroke, seizures, cerebrovascular accident

Management Directed at correcting body temperature, regardless of etiology. Rapidly cool the patient with cold water, wet blankets, and ice. Give benzodiazepines to prevent shivering, which increases metabolic demand and heat generation. Rule out causes of fever such as infection or drug reaction.
======================================
KEY FACT

Classic causes of medication-induced hyperthermia include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and serotonin syndrome (SS). Malignant hyperthermia is caused by anesthetic agents used in the OR; treat with dantrolene. NMS and SS are both caused by psychiatric medication and/or substances that have similar neuroreceptor activity.

ENVIRONMENT

BURNS

A leading cause of death in children. Patients with serious burns should be treated in an ICU setting. Burns can be chemical, electrical, or thermal. Chemical and electrical burns require special considerations found in Table 2.16-6. Burns of all types are categorized by depth of tissue destruction (see Fig. 2.16-12):

======================================
KEY FACT

Superinfection in burns is commonly caused by Pseudomonas or gram ⊕ cocci.

History/PE Patients may present with obvious skin wounds, but significant deep destruction may not

be visible, especially with electrical burns.

Determine whether inhalation of smoke occurred, as it would in a closed-space fire (risk

for carbon monoxide [CO] poisoning) or with burning carpets and textiles (risk for cyanide poisoning).

Conduct a thorough airway and lung examination to assess for inhalation injury.

Diagnosis Best initial step: Assess ABCs. If evidence of thermal or inhalation injury to the upper

airway exists, intubate.

Next step: Evaluate the percentage of body surface area (% BSA) involved (see Fig. 2.16- 13).

a } Entire head ( 45 )) — 9% = } Vey Y / if Anterior torso Je y a 9% Upper back ] 9% 3 \ Entire arm———— 9% 45 Anterior abdomen Posterior leg 9%

FIGURE 2.16-13. The rule of 9s in the estimation of BSA. Estimation of BSA is imperative in the evaluation of burn victims. (Reproduced with permission USMLE-Rx.com.)

In patients exposed to smoke, suspect inhalation injury, CO poisoning, and cyanide poisoning. Obtain a CXR, carboxyhemoglobin level, and lactate.

Assess for circumferential eschar formation, which can obstruct venous and lymphatic drainage, leading to vascular compromise and compartment syndrome.

Treatment Best initial treatment: Fluid repletion. For second- and third-degree burns, initiate fluids based on the Parkland formula. Titrate fluids to maintain at least 1 cc/kg/hr urine output.

KEY FACT

Parkland formula: Fluids for the first 24 hours (in mL) = 4 × patient’s weight in kg × % BSA. Give 50% of fluids over the first 8 hours from the time of injury and the remaining 50% over the following 16 hours.

Topical antimicrobials (eg, mafenide acetate or silver sulfadiazine) can be used prophylactically when the epidermis is no longer intact. There is no proven benefit associated with the use of PO/IV antibiotics or corticosteroids.

Perform an escharotomy to relieve obstructed vascular flow in circumferential burns. Other management includes tetanus vaccination, if appropriate; stress ulcer prophylaxis;

and IV narcotic analgesia.

DROWNING

Assess for hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoxemia. May have cervical spine injuries, so cervical spine should be immobilized until this is ruled out.

Diagnosis Diagnostic testing:

Primary and secondary survey Chest radiography CBC and arterial blood gas

Treatment Remove wet clothes and rewarm Correct hypoxemia and acidosis

HIGH-ALTITUDE SICKNESS

Typically hours after a fast ascent with higher risk at extreme altitude (>20,000 feet).

Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis.

Acute mountain sickness: dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting High-altitude pulmonary edema: cough, shortness of breath, hypoxia, crackles on

auscultation

High-altitude cerebral edema: severe fatigue, confusion, ataxia

Treatment Supplemental O2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating headaches Acetazolamide Dexamethasone Descent from high altitude

KEY FACT

Common microbiology of bites: Pasteurella species, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Bartonella, and Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species.

KEY FACT

Bites involving sharp teeth and resulting in deep puncture should not be sutured closed. Treat with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and monitor for developing deep tissue infections, including osteomyelitis.

======================================
TOXICOLOGY

RESUSCITATION OF THE POISONED PATIENT

Evaluation Consider and evaluate for toxic ingestion in any patient presenting with altered mental

status or unexplained seizure-like activity.

Airway, breathing, and circulation always take precedence in the resuscitation of the potentially poisoned patient.

ECG changes and cardiac dysrhythmias are common in overdose. An initial ECG should be obtained in the evaluation of the poisoned patient.

A thorough neurologic examination, including pupil reactivity, muscle tone, and reflexes, is important to note and can help differentiate toxidromes that otherwise present very similarly.

Decontamination As part of the resuscitation of a poisoned patient, decontamination should be considered. The main goal of decontamination is preventing further drug absorption. Recent ingestions (<2 hours) should generally receive activated charcoal (exceptions are lithium, iron, lead, hydrocarbons, or toxic alcohols). Care should be taken with lethargic patients because aspiration of activated charcoal can cause pneumonitis. Orogastric lavage is rarely indicated but may help for lethal toxins ingested <1 hour prior. Ipecac syrup is an antiquated treatment

for poisoning that is never used because of the risk for ↑ damage caused by emesis and the lack of demonstrated benefit.

HIGH-YIELD TOXICITIES

Carbon Monoxide Poisoning A hypoxemic poisoning syndrome seen in patients who have been exposed to automobile exhaust, smoke inhalation, barbecues, or old appliances in poorly ventilated locations.

History/PE Presents with headaches and confusion. Cherry-red skin discoloration is rare. Coma or

seizures occur in severe cases.

Chronic low-level exposure may cause flulike symptoms with generalized myalgias, nausea, and headaches. The physician should ask about symptoms in others living in the same place.

The physician should suspect smoke inhalation in the presence of singed nose hairs, facial burns, hoarseness, wheezing, or carbonaceous sputum.

Diagnosis Assessment of serum carboxyhemoglobin level, using co-oximetry (normal is <5% in

nonsmokers and <10% in smokers).

ECG in older adult'patients evidence of cardiac in women of 100% O, facemask until co-oximetry falls to

The physician should perform an ECG in older adult patients and those with a history of cardiac disease to evaluate for evidence of cardiac ischemia.

A pregnancy test should be checked in women of childbearing age.

Treatment The physician should treat with 100% O2 facemask until the patient is asymptomatic and

the carboxyhemoglobin level on co-oximetry falls to normal.

Indications for hyperbaric O2: Pregnancy (↑ affinity of CO to fetal hemoglobin [Hb]), signs of CNS or cardiac ischemia, or severely ↑ carboxyhemoglobin (>25%).

Intubate early in patients with airway burns or smoke inhalation, as upper airway edema can rapidly lead to complete obstruction.
======================================
KEY FACT

In carbon monoxide poisoning, the measured O2 saturation is usually normal. This is because the pulse oximeter recognizes carboxyhemoglobin as a normal saturated hemoglobin molecule, so it does not adequately reflect the low arterial PO2 levels.

Methemoglobinemia A syndrome of hypoxemia after exposure to an oxidizing agent (eg, local anesthetics, dapsone, nitrites) that oxidizes ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+), resulting in impaired oxygen transportation.

KEY FACT

Induced methemoglobinemia using nitrites is a treatment strategy for cyanide toxicity

because oxidized hemoglobin binds with high affinity to cyanide, competing with cyanide’s binding to cytochrome C.

History/PE History of exposure to local anesthetic, nitrite, or dapsone. Cyanosis with “chocolate-colored blood” on blood draw.

A 36-year-old woman is brought in by emergency medical services after suspected cocaine overdose. The patient is found to be in ventricular tachycardia and, after cardioversion, complains of abdominal pain. What study should be ordered?

Diagnosis The physician should not rely on pulse oximetry and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2).

Pulse oximetry will be low, and PO2 will be falsely normal.

Direct methemoglobin measurement using co-oximetry can confirm diagnosis.

======================================
KEY FACT

Serum cyanide concentration is a slow lab test that will not result in time to save the patient. Diagnose cyanide poisoning based on high clinical suspicion (inhalation of burning carpet/textiles and elevated lactate).

Cocaine use may lead to nonobstructive mesenteric ischemia because of perfusion deficits secondary to cardiac arrhythmias. Abdominal CT angiography should be ordered to screen for ischemia in those with abdominal pain.

TRAUMA MANAGEMENT

The advanced trauma life support (ATLS) algorithm divides management into two phases: the primary survey focuses on resuscitation and gross identification of injuries, whereas the secondary survey serves as a more detailed head-to-toe assessment of the patient. Many USMLE questions on trauma depend on knowing the order of the primary and secondary surveys. Remember, establishing and maintaining airway patency takes precedence over all other treatments.
======================================
KEY FACT

Remember the rhyme, “GCS 8 (or less), intubate!”

PRIMARY SURVEY

Airway Assessment: If the patient can speak clearly, the airway is intact. If not, consider these

indications for emergency airway management:

Structural airway damage: Subcutaneous emphysema in neck, gurgling noises during breathing, or major facial trauma with blood in the airway

Airway compression (see Fig. 2.16-16): Dysphonia, stridor, expanding neck hematoma

FIGURE 2.16-16. Airway compression. Lateral x-ray of the neck reveals a profoundly swollen epiglottis and complete airway obstruction. (Reproduced with permission from Charuvanij S, Houghton KM. Acute epiglottitis as the initial presentation of pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Pediatr Rheumatol Online J. 2009 Oct 31;7:19. doi: 10.1186/1546-0096-7-19.)

Somnolence: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less (see Table 2.16-13)

Thermal or inhalation injury: Should be suspected in patients with singed facial/nasal hairs, facial burns, or soot in the posterior oropharynx or sputum. Early airway management is indicated, as swelling of the airway with inflammation or with the administration of IV fluids may interfere with delayed intubation.

Management: Emergency airway:

Endotracheal intubation: Preferred method, even in setting of cervical spinal trauma. If cervical spine trauma has not been ruled out, the patient should be immobilized during intubation.

Nasotracheal intubation with fiberoptic bronchoscope: Preferred if tracheobronchial tree is ruptured. This is contraindicated if there is basilar skull

fracture (risk for intracranial penetration).

Emergency cricothyroidotomy: Attempted only if other methods are ineffective. Emergency tracheostomy: In general, never to be done. The physician should choose

cricothyroidotomy instead.

Breathing Assessment: Breath sounds, chest rise, oxygen saturation Management:

If patient has bilateral breath sounds and good chest rise but cannot oxygenate, intubate and mechanically ventilate.

Differentiate using percussion (dullness = hemothorax; resonance = pneumothorax). Can verify with CXR only if patient is hemodynamically stable. Insert chest tube to decompress lung and drain fluid accumulation in pleural space. If patient is hemodynamically unstable with a suspected tension pneumothorax, needle decompression is performed as a stabilizing measure until a chest tube is placed for definitive management.

If patient has unilateral breath sounds on the right after intubation, consider right mainstem bronchus intubation. Obstructive atelectasis of the left lung may occur with an endotracheal tube remaining in the right mainstem bronchus for an extended period. CXR may show the endotracheal tube below the carina. Withdraw the tube above the carina to ventilate both lungs.

(systolic blood pressure shock in trauma are as There are only five

Circulation Assessment: Evaluate for shock (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <90 mm Hg, fast and

weak pulse, pallor, diaphoresis).

Management: Three causes of shock in trauma are as follows:

Hemorrhage (most common): There are only five compartments that hold enough blood volume to cause shock: the chest, abdomen, pelvis, extremities, and floor (external hemorrhage). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) will never cause hypovolemic shock because herniation and death will occur before enough volume is lost to cause shock. Place two large-bore IVs (16 gauge or larger) and bolus 2 L isotonic crystalloid. If still unstable, transfuse packed RBCs and look for the source of bleeding. Transfuse 1 unit fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for every 4 units PRBCs given except in the case of severe trauma or obstetric bleeding. A 1:1:1 ratio of FFP:platelets:PRBCs is used for trauma patients requiring massive transfusion.

Tension pneumothorax: Diagnose clinically if hypotension, tracheal deviation, ↓ O2 saturation, unilateral decreased breath sounds/hyperresonance. Needle decompression with IV catheter for immediate stabilization, and then place chest tube for definitive management. Do not wait for CXR to intervene (see Fig. 2.16-17).
======================================

Pan Afr Med J. 2015;22:143 doi:10.11604/pamj.2015.22.143.8097.)

Cardiac tamponade: Suspect if hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distention (Beck triad). Confirm with ultrasound (see Fig. 2.16-18). Surgical intervention can occur via pericardial window, pericardiocentesis, or thoracotomy.

FIGURE 2.16-18. Cardiac tamponade. Echocardiogram in a patient with cardiac tamponade shows a large pericardial effusion with right atrial (arrow) and right ventricular (arrowhead) collapse.

KEY FACT

When IV access is necessary but cannot be obtained after multiple attempts, place an interosseous line.

Deformities/Deficits Assessment: Assess for traumatic brain injury using the GCS and pupillary examination. Assess for spinal cord injury by examining movement and gross sensation in extremities.

Exposure

Assessment: Assess visible injuries, take body temperature, log-roll the patient to evaluate for spinal step-offs or deformities, and perform rectal exam to assess sphincter tone.

Management: Remove clothing, and cover with warm blankets.

KEY FACT

A rough estimate of SBP can be made based on palpated pulses. Palpable carotid = 60 mm Hg, femoral = 70 mm Hg, and radial = 80 mm Hg.

SECONDARY SURVEY

After the patient’s ABCDEs are managed, conduct a full head-to-toe exam.

Adjuncts to survey:

Procure CXR, x-ray of the pelvis, and focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) to screen for intra-abdominal or pericardial fluid.

Pertinent labs should address mechanism of injury, intoxication or overdose, and medical history. Type and cross-match all patients of concern or with hemorrhage.

Place urinary catheter to monitor urine output in hemodynamically unstable patients to guide resuscitation and in those undergoing surgery.

undergoing surgery. requiring mechanical the assessment of with head:trauma, loss status, facial injuries, needed for all patients Utilization

Place orogastric tube for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Order radiologic studies based on the assessment of hemodynamically stable patients:

CT of the head for any patient with head trauma, loss of consciousness, drowsiness/altered mental status, facial injuries, structural skull damage, or neurologic deficits.

Cervical spine (C-spine) CT needed for all patients <60 years of age who satisfy one of the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria. Criteria include midline C-spine tenderness, altered mental status, intoxication, neurologic deficits, or distracting injuries. CT imaging is superior and preferred over x-ray for evaluation of C-spine fractures. If fracture is detected, proceed to image the full spine.
======================================
KEY FACT

The physician should always rule out urethral injury before placing a urinary catheter. Blood at the meatus, hematuria, difficulty voiding, high-riding prostate, and scrotal hematoma are signs of urethral injury. A retrograde urethrogram can identify the injury.
======================================
PENETRATING TRAUMA

This section describes management of specific trauma injuries after the initial evaluation using primary and secondary surveys. These considerations generally assume ABCDEs are previously secured.

can be devastating to neurologic function. In the hemodynamically stable patient, emergent CT of the brain should be performed to assess the degree of intracranial injury. Facial lacerations should be evaluated for damage to nearby/underlying structures. Motor and sensory function of the facial and trigeminal nerves should be assessed. CT scan may be used to evaluate bony damage to the facial sinuses. Facial lacerations may generally be closed with primary intention after thorough washout.

Eyes Penetrating injury to the globe is commonly associated with intraocular foreign bodies. Exam findings consistent with globe laceration include visual deficits, gross deformity, volume loss of globe, teardrop-shaped pupil, leakage of vitreous humor, and a positive Seidel sign (clearing of fluorescein as aqueous humor leaks from the anterior chamber). Globe lacerations may be accompanied by hyphema of the anterior chamber and are often associated with orbital fractures.

If there is suspicion for globe laceration, care must be taken to avoid placing any pressure on the globe, which leads to expulsion of intraocular contents. Avoid eyelid retraction, and do not perform tonometry. To prevent an increase of pressure within the globe and expulsion of intraocular material via vomiting or crying, patients are provided antiemetics, sedation, and pain control.

noncontrast CT through. within 24 hours. with entrapment of eye movement, and severenausea and

Evaluation is performed with noncontrast CT through the orbits. Surgical repair should be pursued within 24 hours. Orbital fractures may be associated with entrapment of the inferior oblique and inferior

rectus muscles, resulting in limited eye movement, and are visualized on CT imaging. The oculocardiac reflex may produce severe nausea and bradycardia, which warrants surgical release of the entrapped muscle.

Ears Evaluation of laceration should include assessment of middle ear injury, basilar skull

fractures, injury to parotid gland, and function of facial nerve. Otorrhea may be tested for β-transferrin to assess for CSF leakage, and CT imaging of the temporal bone may be performed with suspicion of bony involvement.

Primary closure is typically pursued as first-line management, especially with exposure of cartilaginous tissue. Coverage of cartilaginous tissue reduces risk of infection and ischemic necrosis.

Oral Cavity Evaluation of an intraoral laceration should include assessment of dental injury, fracture of the midface/maxilla, and mandibular fracture. CT imaging is preferred for midface and mandibular fractures.

The internal carotid artery (ICA) may course directly posterior to the pharynx in certain anatomic variations. Stabbing injuries to the posterior pharynx or soft palate, typically seen in children who fall with pens or sticks in the oral cavity, may lead to traumatic dissection of the ICA.

Gingival and buccal mucosal lacerations generally do not require primary closure and heal rapidly due to high vascularity. Primary closure is pursued if food particles may become trapped within the wound, if the wound is over 2 cm in length, or if there is tissue

overlying the occlusal surface.

Nasal Trauma Nasal lacerations are often accompanied by injury to the nasal bones. Physical
======================================
examination of nasal injury should include inspection of gross alignment, palpation for bony abnormality, the presence of crepitus, visual inspection and palpation of possible septal hematoma, and detection of possible CSF drainage. CSF draining through the nasal cavity indicates fracture of the cribriform plate.

Septal hematoma: Fluid between the mucoperichondrium and nasal septum results in pressure-related injury and necrosis to the poorly vascularized septal cartilage, which can lead to perforation. Fluid in this space also predisposes to abscess formation. Presence of a septal hematoma therefore requires urgent drainage and packing to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.

A nasal laceration with exposed cartilaginous tissue is considered an indication for empiric antibiotic therapy.

Auricular Hematoma An auricular hematoma refers to a collection of blood typically following blunt trauma to

the cartilaginous pinna of the external ear.

Management should include prompt drainage and compression to prevent reaccumulation of hematoma.

fully drained, permanent occupies, referred the emergency department restrained driver. She receives

If an auricular hematoma is not fully drained, permanent fibrocartilaginous tissue will fill the space in which blood originally occupies, referred to as cauliflower ear.

A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision in which she was the restrained driver. She receives 2 L of crystalloid en route and has a BP of 65/40 mm Hg and a HR of 135 bpm on arrival. She has ↓ breath sounds on the right, flat neck veins, and dullness to percussion on the right side. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Q 2

A 25-year-old man walks into the emergency department holding a blood-soaked towel against his neck after being shot. The patient is anxious, appears pale, and states he heard multiple gunshots. Vital signs after 2 L of crystalloid are BP 86/55 mm Hg, HR 122 bpm, RR 16/min, and SpO2 99%. Physical examination reveals that the neck wound does not extend through the platysma muscle. What is the next step in management?
======================================
NECK

Patients with signs of arterial injury (eg, active bleed, expanding hematoma, neurologic deficit, or hematemesis) or hemodynamic instability require immediate fortification of the airway and transfer to the operating room for exploration.

Stable patients should receive CT angiography (CTA) of the neck. Identified vascular injuries are treated with surgery or embolization.

Patients with suspected injury to the trachea or esophagus (eg, gurgling breath sounds, bubbling wound, pneumomediastinum, crepitus) should be evaluated via direct visualization, using bronchoscopy or esophagoscopy. Alternatively, barium swallow esophagography can evaluate the esophagus.

KEY FACT

Only wounds that violate the platysma muscle are considered true penetrating neck trauma. Other superficial wounds are treated with conservative wound care.

CHEST

Penetrating chest injuries are often treated during the primary survey because they often compromise breathing or cause hemodynamic instability. Evaluation of additional penetrating chest injuries is discussed here.

History/PE If a previously stable chest trauma patient becomes rapidly unstable, suspect air embolism. A new diastolic murmur after chest trauma suggests aortic dissection associated with

aortic valve insufficiency.

thoracostomy suggests the patient is taken to loss.

Massive air leak into tube thoracostomy suggests tracheobronchial injury.

KEY FACT

Leave impaled objects in place until the patient is taken to the operating room, as such objects may tamponade further blood loss.

Diagnosis Procure a CXR for any patient with penetrating chest trauma to evaluate for pneumothorax or hemothorax not found in the primary survey. Aortic disruption, diaphragmatic tear, or esophageal injury may also be evident on CXR.

Chest injuries between the nipples require evaluation of mediastinal structures. The physician should order echocardiography for the heart, CTA for the aorta and its branches, bronchoscopy for the upper airway, and esophagograph/esophagogram for the esophagus.

Treatment Pneumothorax or hemothorax requires placement of a tube thoracostomy. Initial output of 1500 mL or an output of 300 mL/hr for 3 consecutive hours from the tube

thoracostomy warrants operative thoracotomy.

Aortic, diaphragmatic, esophageal, or tracheobronchial injury also warrants surgical correction.

Immediate thoracotomy without transport to the operating room may be indicated for patients with penetrating chest trauma and witnessed cardiac arrest.
======================================
1 A

Hemothorax is the most likely diagnosis. Hemodynamic instability with ↓ breath sounds are concerning for hemothorax and tension pneumothorax. Flat neck veins are more consistent with hemothorax because tension pneumothorax causes ↑ intrathoracic pressure → ↓ ventricular filling → ↑ CVP and distended neck veins. Dullness to percussion also shifts the diagnosis toward hemothorax. Each hemothorax can hold 40% of a patient’s circulating blood volume, and patients may therefore present in hypovolemic shock.

2 A

Administer blood products, and search for a source of bleeding other than the neck. The management of this patient begins with the primary survey. The patient can speak, so airway is intact. RR and SpO2 are within normal limits, so breathing is assumed to be stable. The patient remains hemodynamically unstable despite 2 L of crystalloid, so blood products are administered, and a source of bleeding is sought. The platysma is not violated, so the neck wound is not the cause of significant bleeding despite the blood-soaked towel. There is likely an additional gunshot wound that needs to be identified.

ABDOMEN

Penetrating trauma to the abdomen is defined as any object (typically gunshot or knife) that violates the peritoneum. An important step in management is determining whether peritoneal signs (guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness) are present. These injuries are managed according to the mechanism:

Gunshot wounds below the nipple (fourth intercostal space) require immediate exploratory laparotomy.

Abdominal stab wounds warrant immediate exploratory laparotomy if the patient exhibits hemodynamic instability, peritoneal signs, or extruded bowel or omentum.

If the patient does not have these indications, explore the wound to identify violation of the peritoneum. If a defect is found, laparotomy is generally indicated.

If the peritoneum is not violated, observe the patient for 24 hours. Perform a laparotomy if the patient develops hemodynamic instability, peritoneal signs, leukocytosis, or a drop in Hb >3 mg/dL.
======================================
EXTREMITIES

Evaluation of a penetrating injury to the extremities should include an assessment of the soft tissue, bony skeleton, and neurovascular function. Multiple injuries are usually present.

Neurovascular Injuries Check pulses using palpation and Doppler to evaluate for vascular injury. Evaluate motor and sensory function of the extremity. For hard signs of vascular injury (eg, expanding hematoma, pulsatile bleeding, absent

pulse), immediately explore and repair in the operating room.

For soft signs of vascular injury (neurologic deficit, significant bleeding, weak pulse), perform CTA.

Orthopedic Injuries Extremities with multiple injuries are generally treated in the following order:

Extremities with multiple injuries are generally treated in the following order: 1. Fixation/reduction of broken bones.

fixation/reduction, there is risk of reinjury to repaired vessels with the jagged bone edges during fracture reduction. 3. Reapproximation of injured nerves. 4. If an injury separates an appendage from the body, parts should be placed in gauze

moistened with saline, sealed inside a plastic bag, and placed on ice to maximize tissue viability.

5. Contaminated wounds require early wound irrigation and tissue debridement. Also, administer antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis.

Long-term complications include high-output heart failure caused by formation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Despite ↑↑ cardiac output, patients present with signs and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF).

Postamputation Pain DVT: In up to 50% of patients with lower extremity amputation Stump hematoma: Higher risk for patients on antithrombotic therapy

Stump pain: Caused by stump ischemia, neuroma formation, or infection Neuroma: Localized pain; neuroma can be blocked with anesthetic injection

neuroma can be blocked infection of exclusion; commonly ketamine, peripheral nerve

Infection: Osteomyelitis, graft infection Phantom limb pain: Diagnosis of exclusion; commonly described as a burning, aching,

electric-type pain

BLUNT AND DECELERATION TRAUMA

HEAD AND FACE

Evaluate for signs of ↑ intracranial pressure ([ICP], eg, bradycardia, hypertension, respiratory depression, fixed and dilated pupil[s], vomiting, and/or papilledema). Treat ↑ ICP with head elevation, hyperventilation, and IV mannitol.

Linear Skull Fractures Treat nonoperatively with wound care and closure if open. Surgery is reserved for displaced or comminuted fractures.

Epidural Hematomas Lenticular or biconvex shape on CT of the head (see Fig. 2.16-19A). Blood from the middle meningeal artery fills the potential space between the dura and skull. These hemorrhages cannot cross suture lines (the dura is anchored to sutures), but can expand rapidly, causing uncal herniation and death. Patients classically lose consciousness immediately after the injury and undergo a “lucid interval” after which they become comatose. Examination may show ipsilateral blown pupil and ipsilateral hemiparesis. The condition calls for an emergent craniotomy.

FIGURE 2.16-19. Acute epidural and acute subdural hematoma. (A) Noncontrast CT showing a right temporal acute epidural hematoma. Note the characteristic biconvex shape. (B) Noncontrast CT demonstrating a right acute hemispheric subdural hematoma. Note the characteristic crescentic shape. (Image A reproduced with permission from Doherty GM. Current Diagnosis & Treatment: Surgery, 13th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2010. Image B reproduced with permission from Chen MY et al. Basic Radiology. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2004.)

Subdural Hematomas Crescent-shaped bleed on CT of the head (see Fig. 2.16-19B). Blood from the dural bridging veins fills the potential space between the dura and arachnoid mater. These hemorrhages cross suture lines. They may present as acute (immediate), subacute (days), or chronic (weeks). Perform craniotomy if CT shows midline shift or patient develops worsening neurologic symptoms or mental status. Otherwise, manage ICP and use fluids judiciously to limit cerebral edema.

Diffuse Axonal Injury A pattern of traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially following high-speed motor vehicle

accidents. Accelerating and decelerating shear forces on the white matter tracts of the brain lead to microscopic or gross damage to the brain at the junction of the gray and white matter. Treatment: Resuscitation of the patient, and once the injury has settled, rehabilitation for maximal functional outcome. Supportive measures and prevention of secondary injuries are the goals of long-term therapy.

Basilar Skull Fracture The basilar skull includes the ethmoid bone, orbital plate of frontal bone, petrous or

squamous temporal bone, sphenoid, and occipital bones.

A basilar skull fracture is associated with high-impact, blunt-force trauma; the fracture most commonly involves the temporal bone.

Fractures including the temporal bone are highly associated with epidural hematomas because of proximity to the middle meningeal artery.

Signs of basilar skull fractures include postauricular or mastoid ecchymosis (Battle sign), periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes), clear rhinorrhea or otorrhea (CSF leak), and hemotympanum.

A CSF leak may be tested by placing a drop of rhinorrhea or otorrhea onto an absorbent

surface. It is positive if there is a concentration of blood in the center with a lighter stain of CSF surrounding the blood. β-Transferrin is tested to confirm the presence of CSF. All patients with basilar skull fractures are hospitalized to allow monitoring for altered

mental status or progression of intracranial bleeding. Most basilar skull fractures will heal spontaneously, requiring no treatment. However, an associated CSF leak persisting for more than 7 days should be repaired operatively because of the significantly increased risk of meningitis without repair.

treatment. However, an operatively because Injury (MVGs), and abuse are
======================================
Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Falls, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), and abuse are prevalent mechanisms of TBI in the

pediatric population.

Typically, workup is pursued after a high-risk mechanism of injury. However, some children without an obviously high risk for TBI should still be evaluated. Children with a history of significant loss of consciousness, altered mental status, vomiting, headache, and progression of symptoms should be evaluated for TBI, similar to patients with a high-risk mechanism of injury.

Evaluation of a TBI includes a detailed neurologic examination, assigning a GCS score, and may include imaging of the brain with a CT scan. A CT of the head may initially be normal even in patients with obvious TBI from clinical history. These patients should be evaluated with an MRI, which is more sensitive for diffuse axonal injury and cerebral edema. The physician should intubate patients with a GCS score of 8 or less.

Children with TBI have a high risk of cervical spine injury and must be placed in a cervical collar. It is typically difficult to rule out this type of injury in TBI patients due to altered mental status with or without sedation.

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) may occur with acceleration or deceleration forces caused by shearing forces between the gray and white matter. DAI causes global injury to the brain and may result in coma. The mechanism of DAI in children includes falls, MVCs, and abuse such as shaken baby syndrome.

TBIs in the pediatric population may be accompanied by brain contusion, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or brain herniation.

After the initial injury, children with TBI experience decreased cerebral perfusion and

increased metabolic demand. The combination of lower oxygen supply and higher oxygen demand increases the risk for secondary hypoxic injury.

Diffuse cerebral swelling is observed more frequently in the pediatric population, compared to adults, via poorly understood mechanisms.

Management includes monitoring of blood pressure and ICP to ensure cerebral perfusion. Diligent fluid resuscitation and avoidance of antihypertensives are pursued to avoid hypoperfusion and secondary ischemic brain injury.

Le Fort Fractures The Le Fort grading system is used for fractures of the midface, which extend posteriorly through the pterygoid plates and separate the maxilla from the cranium. All of the Le Fort fractures run through the pterygoid plates, and classification is based on the different fracture patterns in the anterior bones of the midface.

Airway compromise due to maxillary impaction is a significant concern with these fractures. Urgent management would involve disimpaction of the displaced segment and reassessment of the airway.

Le Fort I fractures are transverse fractures through the maxilla, inferior to the zygoma. Physical examination is notable for mobility of the maxilla with rocking maneuvers and malocclusion.

Le Fort II fractures are pyramidal fractures involving the nasal bridge, lacrimal bones, medial orbital floor, and lateral wall of the maxillary sinus.

from the nasal.bridge, injuries are commonly is notable for complete reduction and surgical life-threatening associated major goal of reduction

Le Fort III fractures run transversely from the nasal bridge, through the orbits, and involve the frontozygomatic suture. These injuries are commonly associated with basilar skull fractures. Physical examination is notable for complete instability of the midface on rocking maneuvers.
======================================
These fractures warrant open reduction and surgical fixation of the midface after management of more urgent or life-threatening associated injuries. Reapproximation of dental occlusive surfaces is a major goal of reduction and fixation. If the mandible is also displaced, then the maxilla is fixed, based on the superior bony structures as a baseline, and the mandible is reduced to approximate with the occlusive surfaces of the maxilla.

After fixation, patients are placed on a liquid diet and advanced appropriately.

Q

A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) 5 hours after he hit his head on a concrete sidewalk while skateboarding. He did not lost consciousness. His neurologic exam is intact, and he reports mild pain in his head where the impact occurred. What is the next step in ED management?

CHEST

Tracheobronchial Disruption Tracheobronchial disruption is most often caused by deceleration shearing forces.

Physical findings include respiratory distress, hemoptysis, sternal tenderness, and subcutaneous emphysema.

Radiographs may show a large pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum (see Fig. 2.16-20).

FIGURE 2.16-20. CXR reveals pneumomediastinum (white arrows) and subcutaneous emphysema (black arrows). (Reproduced with permission from van Heijl M, Saltzherr TP, van Berge Henegouwen MI, Goslings JC. Unique case of esophageal rupture after a fall from height.

A persistent air leak may be present when the chest tube when hooked to wall suction.

Pulmonary Contusion Associated with thoracic trauma and generally appearing within 24 hours. A pulmonary contusion may lead to hypoxia from damage to capillaries, causing interstitial fluid accumulation. Hypoxia therefore tends to worsen with fluid hydration.

Look for patchy unilateral infiltrates on CXR, not restricted by lobar anatomy. Intubate if necessary and be judicious about IV fluids. Noninvasive positive-pressure

ventilation may also be used.

It is more common in children because of a less rigid, protective chest wall.

Flail Chest Three or more adjacent ribs are fractured at two points, causing paradoxical movement of the segment. The segment moves inward with inspiration and outward during exhalation (see Fig. 2.16-21).

FIGURE 2.16-21. Flail chest. (Reproduced with permission from USMLE-Rx.com.)

Respiratory compromise in flail chest occurs because of underlying pulmonary contusion rather than the flail chest itself.

Pain control and positive-pressure ventilation compose the mainstay of treatment for flail chest. Ribs can be fixed surgically, especially in severe cases.
======================================
KEY FACT

The first rib, scapula, and sternum are thick, strong bones and difficult to break. Blunt trauma causing these fractures is associated with aortic disruption.

Unilateral Diaphragmatic Paralysis Note that the phrenic nerve courses from C3 to C5 in the neck, wraps around the anterior scalene muscle, and then travels over the anterior pericardium before innervating the diaphragm. Injury to any of these regions could therefore cause injury to the phrenic nerve.

Patients may be asymptomatic, experience increased exertional dyspnea or orthopnea, or have decreased exercise tolerance.

Unilateral diaphragm paralysis is more common and may be seen as an incidental finding on imaging without any related complaints. Bilateral disease is more likely to be observed in the context of muscular disorders.

would be suspected and is confirmed with a of the paralyzed paralysis is diagnosed (FVC) on,pulmonary

A diagnosis of unilateral paralysis would be suspected with an elevated hemidiaphragm (Fig. 2.16-22) on upright CXR and is confirmed with a fluoroscopic sniff test. This test observes a paradoxical elevation of the paralyzed hemidiaphragm during forceful inspiration (sniffing). Bilateral paralysis is diagnosed with clinical history and is aided by reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) on pulmonary function tests.

FIGURE 2.16-22. Left diaphragmatic paralysis. Chest x-ray displaying elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with displacement of bowels into the left hemithorax. (Reproduced with permission from Elshafie G, Acosta J, Aliverti A, et al. Chest wall mechanics before and after diaphragm plication. J Cardiothorac Surg. 2016;11:25. Published 2016 Feb 2. doi:10.1186/s13019-016-0419-x.)

Unilateral paralysis may not require any treatment. Patients requiring intervention may be treated with surgical plication, which tightens the hemidiaphragm and prevents negative thoracic pressure from upwardly displacing the paralyzed diaphragm during inspiration, allowing for more efficient air movement into the lungs. Treatment may involve ventilatory support.

Bilateral paralysis usually requires ventilatory support. Stimulation of the phrenic nerve

with a pacemaker device is suitable for certain candidates with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and an intact phrenic nerve.

Discharge the patient. If GCS is over 14, patients with loss of consciousness can be observed with instructions to return immediately if neurologic symptoms develop.

Diaphragm Rupture Injury to the diaphragm is rare and typically associated with penetrating or blunt injuries to the abdomen or thorax. The left hemidiaphragm is more commonly injured than the right, which is possibly because of the protective effect of the liver under the right hemidiaphragm.

Penetrating injuries to the diaphragm generally result in smaller perforations and are therefore more likely to remain undetected, compared to blunt abdominal trauma, which results in large tears. Blunt force to the abdomen or chest increases pressure in the abdominal or thoracic cavity and distends the diaphragm, leading to rupture.

Any blunt-force trauma to the abdomen or chest and any penetrating injury between the T4 and T12 dermatomes should raise suspicion of diaphragmatic injury.

Diagnosis is frequently made using CT imaging while assessing for life-threatening injuries or hemorrhage. However, smaller tears may not be visible. Ultrasound may visualize discontinuity of the diaphragm during FAST scans, and upright CXR may show herniation of abdominal contents into the hemithorax.

smaller tears may-not diaphragm during FAST into the hemithorax. is high, laparoscopic associated with herniation pulmonary contusion, ruptures on the left side

If suspicion for diaphragm rupture is high, laparoscopic exploration is pursued. Diaphragm rupture may be associated with herniation of abdominal or thoracic contents, diaphragm paralysis, rib fractures, pulmonary contusion, atelectasis, or biliary fistula.
======================================
After diagnosis, all diaphragm ruptures on the left side are surgically repaired. Right-sided diaphragm ruptures are first managed nonoperatively, because the liver tamponades the injury and decreases the risk for developing complications of the rupture.

BLUNT CARDIAC INJURY

Also known as myocardial contusion, blunt cardiac injury may present as a new bundle branch block, ectopy or dysrhythmia, or hypotension.

Severe contusion can present with left ventricle (LV) dysfunction and cardiogenic shock. Serum cardiac biomarkers are often elevated.

Treatment is largely supportive, sometimes requiring inotropes.

Q 1

A 44-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a motor vehicle collision. On arrival, her BP is 70/35 mm Hg and her heart rate 110 bpm. Physical examination reveals bruises over the chest and abdomen. A pulmonary artery catheter is placed and reveals a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 16 mm Hg. After resuscitation with 2 L of crystalloid, BP and heart rate measurements are 80/40 mm Hg and 125 bpm, respectively. PCWP is now 24 mm Hg. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A

A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following a motor vehicle collision in which he was an unrestrained passenger. X-rays show multiple fractures. Several hours later he develops fever, respiratory distress, and a rash consisting of small red and purple 1- to 2-mm macules covering his arms and shoulders. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Aortic Disruption Aortic disruption is classically caused by rapid deceleration injury (eg, high-speed motor vehicle accidents, ejection from vehicles, fall from heights).

Injury is most common in the proximal thoracic aorta near the ligamentum arteriosum, which anchors the aorta in place. The adjacent aorta displaces forward, creating shear force.

CXR reveals a widened mediastinum, loss of aortic knob, pleural cap, deviation of the trachea and esophagus, and depression of the left mainstem bronchus (see Fig. 2.16-23).

FIGURE 2.16-23. Aortic disruption. CXR of hypotensive man injured in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Findings include (1) widened mediastinum; (2) deviation of the trachea to the right; (3) widening of the right paratracheal stripe; (4) left apical cap; (5) blurring of the aortic knob; (6) deviation of the nasogastric (NG) tube to the right; and (7) obliteration of the aortopulmonary window.

echocardiogram or intraoperative evaluation. Emergency surgery is required for any defect.
======================================
KEY FACT

Because complete aortic rupture is rapidly fatal (85% die at the scene), patients with aortic disruption seen in the emergency department usually have a contained hematoma within the adventitia.

KEY FACT

Hoarseness of the voice can be caused by aortic disruption as expansion of the hematoma impinges on the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.

ABDOMEN

While management of specific organ damage is beyond the scope of Step 2 CK, some common associations come in handy (see Table 2.16-14). Figure 2.16-24 describes the diagnostic workup for blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). The FAST exam is preferred over diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in unstable patients, but DPL is used for unequivocal FAST or if FAST is unavailable. Assess hemodynamically stable patients with CT scan. Patients with minor BAT (no seatbelt sign [see Fig. 2.16-25], mild tenderness) may be observed with serial abdominal scans.

Anticoagulation and cardiac catheterization place patients at risk for retroperitoneal hematoma. Look for back pain, flank bruising, and hemodynamic instability.

1 A

The most likely diagnosis is cardiogenic or obstructive shock probably caused by severe blunt trauma to the chest. The patient has signs of shock, and her ↑ PCWP suggests either a cardiogenic or an obstructive cause. Based on the mechanism of injury, she may have severe myocardial contusion or cardiac tamponade.

2 A

Fat embolism. The classic presentation of fat embolism is fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, conjunctival hemorrhage, and upper extremity petechiae after a patient suffers long-bone fractures.

In patients with spinal cord injuries, urinary catheter placement is diagnostic and therapeutic for acute urinary retention.

PELVIS

Pelvic Fractures Most commonly occur after high-speed traumas such as motor vehicle accidents or falls from heights. Can cause significant hemorrhage, leading to hypotension and shock.

Diagnosis Apply pressure to the anterior superior iliac spine bilaterally to test for unstable or open

book fracture.

X-ray of the pelvis may confirm the fracture. In a stable patient, CT scan of the pelvis will better define the extent of injury.

Always rule out injuries to other pelvic structures. Perform rectal examination and/or proctoscopy for the rectum, retrograde cystogram for the bladder, pelvic exam for the vagina in women, and retrograde urethrogram for the urethra in men.

KEY FACT

Marfan syndrome, syphilis, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome weaken the aortic wall and predispose to aortic injury.

referred pain to the plexus. Irritation is caused

KEY FACT

Onn

Diaphragmatic irritation can cause referred pain to the shoulder because the phrenic nerve shares origins with the brachial plexus. Irritation is caused by blood, air, or rupture.
======================================
KEY FACT

Because of the ringlike structure of the pelvic anatomy, pelvic fractures tend to occur in multiples rather than singular fractures.

Treatment Transfuse patients as necessary. More than 40% of patients with pelvic fractures require

transfusions.

Management of unstable patients is controversial, but placement of an external pelvic binder over the trochanters (provides stability and tamponade effect) and angiographic embolization probably constitute the safest approach.

External and internal pelvic fixations are also options, but surgery on a bleeding pelvis is risky. This may be the answer in a stable patient or if a pelvic binder is not an option.

Rectus Sheath Hematoma Rectus sheath hematomas arise from hemorrhage of the deep inferior epigastric artery as it inserts into the rectus abdominis muscle and are contained within the rectus abdominis muscle as well as surrounding fascia. Below the arcuate line, the posterior aspect of the rectus abdominis muscle is no longer

supported by the posterior rectus sheath, which predisposes the vessels inserting into the inferior muscle to experience larger shear forces. For this reason, most rectus sheath

hematomas are located in the inferior abdomen.

Rectus sheath hematomas present as acute-onset abdominal pain, an abdominal mass, and constitutional symptoms. Patients may also report back or leg pain. Carnett and Fothergill signs on physical examination help to differentiate the abdominal wall from the abdominal cavity as the origin of pathology.

Carnett sign: Carnett sign is positive when the point of maximum tenderness is unchanged when moving the patient from a supine to upright position.

Fothergill sign: Fothergill sign is positive if the mass does not cross the midline and does not move with movement of the lower extremities.

Diagnosis is confirmed with CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Patients should be treated similarly to any patient with acute blood loss. Monitor

Patients should be treated similarly to any patient with acute blood loss. Monitor hemodynamic status and assess the need for fluid resuscitation or transfusion of RBCs.

hemodynamic status and assess the need for fluid resuscitation or transfusion of RBCs. Patients are treated with CT-guided surgical evacuation of the hematoma and ligation of

actively bleeding vessels.

Patients have drains held to suction during the postoperative period to prevent reaccumulation of the hematoma.

Bladder Injuries Classified based on whether the injury communicates with the peritoneal cavity (intraperitoneal) or stays confined to the pelvis (extraperitoneal).

Rupture of gross hematuria: Rupture of the dome Urine output is low or correction.

Extraperitoneal bladder injury: Rupture of bladder neck/trigone. Pain is localized in the lower abdomen and pelvis. Causes gross hematuria. Treat nonoperatively with Foley catheter.

Intraperitoneal bladder injury: Rupture of the dome of the bladder. Abdominal pain is diffuse ± guarding and rigidity. Urine output is low or absent despite aggressive rehydration. Treat with surgical correction.

Urethral Injury Injury to the urethra is mostly seen in young males and can be categorized as either anterior or posterior.

Insertion of a urethral catheter in a patient with suspected genitourinary injury before retrograde urethrography is contraindicated due to possible exacerbation of urethral injury during insertion.

Patients present with blood at the meatus, high-riding prostate, difficult urination, pelvic fractures, and associated genital or abdominal injuries.

urethra is seen with penetrating trauma to the penis, penile fractures, and straddle injuries. A urethral or suprapubic catheter is placed for bladder drainage. If tissue damage is significant or urethral repair is planned for a later date, then urine should be diverted proximal to the site of the injury via urethrostomy or suprapubic catheter.
======================================
posterior urethra is most common in association with pelvic fractures. The membranous urethra is the most susceptible segment of the entire urethra due to higher mobility and vulnerability to shear forces. Partial posterior urethra injuries are managed with urinary catheters. Complete injuries are first managed with suprapubic tubes, followed by surgical repair.

Rectal and Vaginal Injuries Usually managed nonoperatively unless reconstruction is necessary.

Automatically implements behavioral changes to remain sober Most effective intervention to improve communication during patient transfers? Patient stage — interview strategy 1, Precontemplation (not ready to change) — Discuss risks and consequences 2. Contemplation (thinking of change) — encourage evaluation of pros and cons 3, Preparation (ready for change) -» encourage small steps 4. Action (patient making change) - identify appropriate strategies and enlist social support</nl> 5. Maintenance (implemented change) — follow-up support, relapse prevention 6. Identification (behavior automatic) = praise changes Checklists What isa sentinel event? Any event that results in death, serious physical harm or psychologic harm to a patient Type of analysis used to find the reason for a sentinel event? Root cause analysis Involuntary psychiatric hospitalization can be undertaken for which three reasons? The patient is a danger to self, a danger to others, or gravely disabled (unable to provide for basic needs) Parent of Jehovah's Witness rejects emergency transfusion for their child. What should the clinician do? Patient refuses lifesaving treatment. What is the next step? Clinician not obliged to agree with parent and must provide treat- ment in the best interest of the child (beneficence) Discuss the reason behind the patient's decision before accepting it. True or false: Once patients sign a statement giving consent, they must continue treatment False; patients may change their minds at any time Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emer- gency situations and patients without decision-making capacity Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? When treatment noncompliance represents a serious danger to public health (eg, active TB) When is a minor considered legally emancipated (doesn't require parental consent)? In general, a minor is emancipated if he/she is: married, in armed ser- vices, parent of a child that they support, financially independent and has obtained legal emancipation 15-year-old pregnant girl requires hospitalization for preeclampsia. |s parental consent required? No, parental consent is not necessary for the medical treatment of pregnant minors Mother refuses to allow her child to be vaccinated Parent has the right to refuse treatment for his or her child as long as it does not pose a serious threat to child's well-being 8-year-old child is in a serious accident and requires emergent trans- fusion, but her parents are not present Treat immediately; consent is implied in emergency situations 15-year-old girl seeking treatment for an STI asks that her parents not be told about her condition Minors may consent to care for STIs without parental consent or knowledge

10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds Treat because the disease represents an immediate threat to the child's life In a non-emergency, parents refuse life-saving treatment for child. What Is the next step? Obtain a court order before treatment True or false: itis more difficult to justify the withdrawal of care (e.g, mechanical ventilation) than to have withheld the treatment in the first place False; withdrawing nonbeneficial treatment (eg, mechanical ventila- tion) or treatment a patient no longer wants is ethically equivalent to withholding care When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? When there is no rationale for treatment, maximal intervention is failing, a given intervention has already failed, and treatment will not achieve the goals of care Patient requests to undergo complementary medical treatment (acu- puncture), What is the doctor's next step? Understand the reasons for the patient’s request; be ready to discuss risks and benefits, and be open to Son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer Physician can withhold information from the patient only in the rare case of therapeutic privilege or if patient requests not to be told In what setting is bad news best delivered? Always deliver bad news face-to-face Follow the SPIKES framework (ensure appropriate Setting, assess patient's Perception, Invite questions and assess how much infor- mation they know and would like, impart Knowledge, acknowledge Emotions, Strategize next step when ready) Patient's family asks you not to provide information about a serious diagnosis to patient. What is the next step? Do not deliver the diagnosis initially First, ask the patient whether she would like important health infor- mation communicated to her, and respect the decision if she prefers not to know about it Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden Real threat of harm to third parties Suicidal intentions Certain contagious diseases Elder and child abuse Doctor refers patient for an MRI to a facility that doctor owns What kind of gift can you accept from a pharmaceutical representative?

HOW TO USE THE DATABASE

This section is a database recommended clinical science review resources, question banks, and other test preparation tools marketed to medical students studying shelf exams and the USMLE Step 2 CK. For each resource, we list the Title, the First Author (or editor), the Current Publisher, the Copyright Year, the Edition, the Number of Pages, the ISBN, the Approximate List Price, the Format of the resource, and the Number of Test Questions. Finally, each resource receives a Rating. The resources are sorted into a comprehensive section as well as into sections corresponding to the six clinical disciplines (internal medicine, neurology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery). Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating, then by Author, and finally by Title.

For this edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 2 CK, the database of review resources has been completely revised, with in-depth summary comments on more than 100 books and online and mobile applications. A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student evaluations. Each resource receives a rating as follows:

At Excellent for boards review A , 4 , , ~ , rt ~ , Very good for boards review; choose among the group A- ; B+ : B Good, but use only after exhausting better resources B Fair, but there are many better resources in the discipline; or low- yield subject material

The Rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in preparing for the USMLE Step 2 CK exam. This is based on a number of factors, including the following:

Cost of the resource Readability of the resource Appropriateness and accuracy of the resource Quality and number of sample questions Quality of written answers to sample questions Quality and appropriateness of the illustrations (eg, graphs, diagrams, photographs) Length of the text (longer is not necessarily better) Quality and number of other resources available in the same discipline Importance of the discipline on the USMLE Step 2 CK exam

the resource questions sample questions the illustrations (eg, necessarily better) available in the

Please note that the rating does not reflect the quality of the resource for purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 2 CK exam. Many resources with low ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for USMLE Step 2 CK preparation. We have also avoided listing or commenting on the wide variety of general textbooks available in the clinical sciences.

Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal surveys of hundreds of medical students from medical schools across the country. The summary comments and overall ratings represent a consensus opinion, but there may have been a large range of opinions or limited student feedback on any particular resource. Please note that the data listed are subject to change.

these clinical science review books so that we can update our database (see “How to Contribute,” p. xi). In addition, we ask that publishers and authors submit review copies of clinical science review books, including new editions, and books not included in our database, for evaluation. We also solicit reviews of new books or suggestions for alternate modes of study that may be useful in preparing for the exam, such as flash cards, tutorials, commercial review courses, online resources.

COMMERCIAL REVIEW COURSES

Although commercial preparation courses can be helpful for some students, such courses are typically costly and require significant time commitment. They are usually most effective as an organizing tool for students who feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material involved in Step 2 CK preparation. Note, too, that multiweek courses may be quite intense and may thus leave limited time for independent study. Also note that some commercial courses are designed for first-time test takers, while others focus on students who are repeating the exam. In addition, some courses are geared toward IMGs who want to take all three Steps in a limited amount of time.

Student experience and satisfaction with review courses are highly variable. We suggest that you discuss options with recent graduates of the review courses you are considering. In addition, course content and structure can change rapidly. Some student opinions can be found in online discussion groups.
