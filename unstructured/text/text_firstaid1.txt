Preface

With the 33rd edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 we continue our commitment to providing students with the most useful and up-to-date preparation guide for this exam. This edition represents an outstanding revision in many ways, including:

73 entirely new or heavily revised high-yield topics reflecting evolving trends in the USMLE Step 1.

Extensive text revisions, new mnemonics, clarifications, and corrections curated by a team of 19 medical student and resident physician authors who excelled on their Step 1 examinations, and verified by a team of expert faculty advisors and nationally recognized USMLE instructors.

Updated with 148 new and revised diagrams and illustrations as part of our ongoing collaboration with USMLE-Rx and ScholarRx (MedIQ Learning, LLC).

Updated with 159 new and revised photos to help visualize various disorders, descriptive findings, and basic science concepts. Additionally, revised imaging photos have been labeled and optimized to show both normal anatomy and pathologic findings.

Updated exam preparation advice for the current pass/fail scoring system of the USMLE Step 1, and Step 1 blueprint changes.

Updated photos of patients and pathologies to include a variety of skin colors to better depict real-world presentations.

Revised pharmacology sections to include only those drugs currently approved for the US market.

Improved organization and integration of text, illustrations, clinical images, and tables throughout for focused review of high-yield topics.

Updated Rapid Review section to better reflect exam contents by removing the ‘Classic/Relevant Treatments’ section and adding in a ‘Pathophysiology of Important Diseases’ section.

Revised ratings of current, high-yield review resources, with clear explanations of their relevance to USMLE review. Replaced outdated resources with new ones recommended by Step takers.

Real-time Step 1 updates and corrections can be found exclusively on our blog, www.firstaidteam.com.

We invite students and faculty to share their thoughts and ideas to help us continually improve First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 through our blog and collaborative editorial platform. (See How to Contribute, p. xv.)

How to Contribute

This edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 incorporates thousands of contributions and improvements suggested by student and faculty advisors. We invite you to participate in this process. Please send us your suggestions for:

Study and test-taking strategies for the USMLE Step 1

New facts, mnemonics, diagrams, and clinical images

High-yield topics that may appear on future Step 1 exams

Personal ratings and comments on review books, question banks, apps, videos, and courses

Pathology and radiology images (high resolution) relevant to the facts in the book

For each new entry incorporated into the next edition, you will receive up to a $20 Amazon.com gift card as well as personal acknowledgment in the next edition. Significant contributions will be compensated at the discretion of the authors. Also, let us know about material in this edition that you feel is low yield and should be deleted.

All submissions including potential errata should ideally be supported with hyperlinks to a dynamically updated Web resource such as UpToDate, AccessMedicine, and ClinicalKey.

We welcome potential errata on grammar and style if the change improves readability. Please note that First Aid style is somewhat unique; for example, we have fully adopted the AMA Manual of Style recommendations on eponyms (“We recommend that the possessive form be omitted in eponymous terms”) and on abbreviations (no periods with eg, ie, etc). We also avoid periods in tables unless required for full sentences. Kindly refrain from submitting “style errata” unless you find specific inconsistencies with the AMA Manual of Style or our diversity initiative as discussed in the Foreword.

The preferred way to submit new entries, clarifications, mnemonics, or potential corrections with a valid, authoritative reference is via our website: www.firstaidteam.com.

This website will be continuously updated with validated errata, new high-yield content, and a new online platform to contribute suggestions, mnemonics, diagrams, clinical images, and potential errata.

Alternatively, you can email us at: firstaid@scholarrx.com.

Contributions submitted by May 15, 2023, receive priority consideration for the 2024 edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1. We thank you for taking the time to share your experience and apologize in advance that we cannot individually respond to all contributors as we receive thousands of contributions each year.

======================================
How to Use This Book

CONGRATULATIONS: You now possess the book that has guided nearly two million students to USMLE success for over 30 years. With appropriate care, the binding should last the useful life of the book. Keep in mind that putting excessive flattening pressure on any binding will accelerate its failure. If you purchased a book that you believe is defective, please immediately return it to the place of purchase. If you encounter ongoing issues, you can also contact Customer Service at our publisher, McGraw Hill.

START EARLY: Use this book as early as possible while learning the basic medical sciences. The first semester of your first year is not too early! Devise a study plan by reading Section I: Guide to Efficient Exam Preparation, and make an early decision on resources to use by checking Section IV: Top-Rated Review Resources. Note that First Aid is neither a textbook nor a comprehensive review book, and it is not a panacea for inadequate preparation.

CONSIDER FIRST AID YOUR ANNOTATION HUB: Annotate this book with material from other resources, such as class notes or comprehensive textbooks. This will keep all the high-yield information you need in one place. Other tips on keeping yourself organized:

For best results, use fine-tipped ballpoint pens (eg, BIC Pro+, Uni-Ball Jetstream Sports, Pilot Drawing Pen, Zebra F-301). If you like gel pens, try Pentel Slicci, and for markers that dry almost immediately, consider Staedtler Triplus Fineliner, Pilot Drawing Pen, and Sharpies.

Consider using pens with different colors of ink to indicate different sources of information (eg, blue for USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax, green for UWorld Step 1 Qbank, red for Rx Bricks).

Choose highlighters that are bright and dry quickly to minimize smudging and bleeding through the page (eg, Tombow Kei Coat, Sharpie Gel).

Many students de-spine their book and get it 3-hole-punched. This will allow you to insert materials from other sources, including curricular materials.

INTEGRATE STUDY WITH CASES, FLASH CARDS, AND QUESTIONS: To broaden your learning strategy, consider integrating your First Aid study with case-based reviews (eg, First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1), flash cards (eg, USMLE-Rx Step 1 Flash Facts), and practice questions (eg, the USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax). Read the chapter in the book, then test your comprehension by using cases, flash cards, and questions that cover the same topics. Maintain access to more comprehensive resources (eg, ScholarRx Bricks and USMLE-Rx Step 1 Express videos) for deeper review as needed.

PRIME YOUR MEMORY: Return to your annotated Sections II and III several days before taking the USMLE Step 1. The book can serve as a useful way of retaining key associations and keeping high-yield facts fresh in your memory just prior to the exam. The Rapid Review section includes high-yield topics to help guide your studying.

CONTRIBUTE TO FIRST AID: Reviewing the book immediately after your exam can help us improve the next edition. Decide what was truly high and low yield and send us your comments. Feel free to send us scanned images from your annotated First Aid book as additional support. Of course, always remember that all examinees are under agreement with the NBME to not disclose the specific details of copyrighted test material.

Our goal is to reduce your level of anxiety and help you make the most of your efforts by helping you understand more about the United States Medical Licensing Examination, Step 1 (USMLE Step 1). As a medical student, you are no doubt familiar with taking standardized examinations and quickly absorbing large amounts of material. When you first confront the USMLE Step 1, however, you may find it all too easy to become sidetracked from your goal of studying with maximal effectiveness. Common mistakes that students make when studying for Step 1 include the following:

Starting to study (including First Aid) too late Starting to study intensely too early and burning out Starting to prepare for boards before creating a knowledge foundation Using inefficient or inappropriate study methods Buying the wrong resources or buying too many resources Buying only one publisher’s review series for all subjects Not using practice examinations to maximum benefit Not understanding how scoring is performed or what the result means Not using review books along with your classes Not analyzing and improving your test-taking strategies Getting bogged down by reviewing difficult topics excessively Studying material that is rarely tested on the USMLE Step 1 Failing to master certain high-yield subjects owing to overconfidence Using First Aid as your sole study resource Trying to prepare for it all alone

In this section, we offer advice to help you avoid these pitfalls and be more productive in your studies.

The USMLE Step 1 is the first of three examinations that you would normally pass in order to become a licensed physician in the United States. The USMLE is a joint endeavor of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). The USMLE serves as the single examination system domestically and internationally for those seeking medical licensure in the United States.

The Step 1 exam includes test items that can be grouped by the organiza- tional constructs outlined in Table 1 (in order of tested frequency). In late 2020, the USMLE increased the number of items assessing communication skills. While pharmacology is still tested, they are focusing on drug mecha- nisms rather than on pharmacotherapy. You will not be required to identify the specific medications indicated for a specific condition. Instead, you will be asked more about drug mechanisms and side effects.

How Is the Computer-Based Test (CBT) Structured?

The CBT Step 1 exam consists of one “optional” tutorial/simulation block and seven “real” question blocks of up to 40 questions per block with no more than 280 questions in total, timed at 60 minutes per block. A short 11-question survey follows the last question block. The computer begins the survey with a prompt to proceed to the next block of questions.

Once an examinee finishes a particular question block on the CBT, he or she must click on a screen icon to continue to the next block. Examinees cannot go back and change their answers to questions from any previously completed block. However, changing answers is allowed within a block of questions as long as the block has not been ended and if time permits.

What Is the CBT Like?

Given the unique environment of the CBT, it’s important that you become familiar ahead of time with what your test-day conditions will be like. You can access a 15-minute tutorial and practice blocks at http://orientation. nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1. This tutorial interface is the same as the one you will use in the exam; learn it now and you can skip taking it during the exam, giving you up to 15 extra minutes of break time. You can gain experience with the CBT format by taking the 120 practice questions (3 blocks with 40 questions each) available online for free (https://www.usmle. org/prepare-your-exam) or by signing up for a practice session at a test center for a fee.

For security reasons, examinees are not allowed to bring any personal electronic equipment into the testing area. This includes both digital and analog watches, cell phones, tablets, and calculators. Examinees are also prohibited from carrying in their books, notes, pens/pencils, and scratch paper (laminated note boards and fine-tip dry erase pens will be provided for use within the testing area). Food and beverages are also prohibited in the testing area. The testing centers are monitored by audio and video surveillance equipment. However, most testing centers allot each examinee a small locker outside the testing area in which he or she can store snacks, beverages, and personal items.

Questions are typically presented in multiple choice format, with 4 or more possible answer options. There is a countdown timer on the lower left corner of the screen as well. There is also a button that allows the examinee to mark a question for review. If a given question happens to be longer than the screen, a scroll bar will appear on the right, allowing the examinee to see the rest of the question. Regardless of whether the examinee clicks on an answer choice or leaves it blank, he or she must click the “Next” button to advance to the next question.

` Heart sounds are tested via media questions. Make sure you know how different heart diseases sound on auscultation.

` Be sure to test your headphones during the tutorial.

The USMLE features a small number of media clips in the form of audio and/or video. There may even be a question with a multimedia heart sound simulation. In these questions, a digital image of a torso appears on the screen, and the examinee directs a digital stethoscope to various auscultation points to listen for heart and breath sounds. The USMLE orientation materials include several practice questions in these formats. During the exam tutorial, examinees are given an opportunity to ensure that both the audio headphones and the volume are functioning properly. If you are already familiar with the tutorial and planning on skipping it, first skip ahead to the section where you can test your headphones. After you are sure the headphones are working properly, proceed to the exam.

` Familiarize yourself with the commonly tested lab values (eg, Hb, WBC, Ca2+, Na+, K+).

` Illustrations on the test include: Gross specimen photos Histology slides Medical imaging (eg, x-ray, CT, MRI) Electron micrographs Line drawings

The examinee can call up a window displaying normal laboratory values. In order to do so, he or she must click the “Lab” icon on the top part of the screen. Afterward, the examinee will have the option to choose between “Blood,” “Cerebrospinal,” “Hematologic,” or “Sweat and Urine.” The normal values screen may obscure the question if it is expanded. The examinee may have to scroll down to search for the needed lab values. You might want to memorize some common lab values so you spend less time on questions that require you to analyze these.

The CBT interface provides a running list of questions on the left part of the screen at all times. The software also permits examinees to highlight or cross out information by using their mouse. There is a “Notes” icon on the top part of the screen that allows students to write notes to themselves for review at a later time. Finally, the USMLE has recently added new functionality including text magnification and reverse color (white text on black background). Being familiar with these features can save time and may help you better view and organize the information you need to answer a question.

For those who feel they might benefit, the USMLE offers an opportunity to take a simulated test, or “CBT Practice Session” at a Prometric center. Students are eligible to register for this three-and-one-half-hour practice session after they have received their scheduling permit.

The same USMLE Step 1 sample test items (120 questions) available on the USMLE website are used at these sessions. No new items will be presented. The practice session is available at a cost of $75 ($155 if taken outside of the US and Canada) and is divided into a short tutorial and three 1-hour blocks of ~40 test items each. Students receive a printed percent- correct score after completing the session. No explanations of questions are provided.
======================================
` You can take a shortened CBT practice test at a Prometric center.

You may register for a practice session online at www.usmle.org. A separate scheduling permit is issued for the practice session. Students should allow two weeks for receipt of this permit.

How Do I Register to Take the Exam?

Prometric test centers offer Step 1 on a year-round basis, except for the first two weeks in January and major holidays. Check with the test center you want to use before making your exam plans.

` The Prometric website will display a calendar with open test dates.

US students can apply to take Step 1 at the NBME website. This application allows you to select one of 12 overlapping three-month blocks in which to be tested (eg, April–May–June, June–July–August). Choose your three-month eligibility period wisely. If you need to reschedule outside your initial three- month period, you can request a one-time extension of eligibility for the next contiguous three-month period, and pay a rescheduling fee. The application also includes a photo ID form that must be certified by an official at your medical school to verify your enrollment. After the NBME processes your application, it will send you a scheduling permit.

The scheduling permit you receive from the NBME will contain your USMLE identification number, the eligibility period in which you may take the exam, and two additional numbers. The first of these is known as your “scheduling number.” You must have this number in order to make your exam appointment with Prometric. The second number is known as the “candidate identification number,” or CIN. Examinees must enter their CINs at the Prometric workstation in order to access their exams. However, you will not be allowed to bring your permit into the exam and will be asked to copy your CIN onto your scratch paper. Prometric has no access to the codes. Make sure to bring a paper or electronic copy of your permit with you to the exam! Also bring an unexpired, government-issued photo ID that includes your signature (such as a driver’s license or passport). Make sure the name on your photo ID exactly matches the name that appears on your scheduling permit.

` Be familiar with Prometric’s policies for cancellation and rescheduling due to COVID-19.

Once you receive your scheduling permit, you may access the Prometric website or call Prometric’s toll-free number to arrange a time to take the exam. You may contact Prometric two weeks before the test date if you want to confirm identification requirements. Be aware that your exam may be canceled because of circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other unforeseen events. If that were to happen, you should receive an email from Prometric containing notice of the cancellation and instructions on rescheduling. Visit www.prometric.com for updates regarding their COVID-19 cancellation and rescheduling policies.

` Test scheduling is done on a “first-come, first-served” basis. It’s important to schedule an exam date as soon as you receive your scheduling permit.

Although requests for taking the exam may be completed more than six months before the test date, examinees will not receive their scheduling permits earlier than six months before the eligibility period. The eligibility period is the three- month period you have chosen to take the exam. Most US medical students attending a school which uses the two-year preclerkship curriculum choose the April–June or June–August period. Most US medical students attending a school which uses the 18-month preclerkship curriculum choose the December–February or January–March period.

What If I Need to Reschedule the Exam?

You can change your test date and/or center by contacting Prometric at 1-800-MED-EXAM (1-800-633-3926) or www.prometric.com. Make sure to have your CIN when rescheduling. If you are rescheduling by phone, you must speak with a Prometric representative; leaving a voicemail message will not suffice. To avoid a rescheduling fee, you will need to request a change at least 31 calendar days before your appointment. Please note that your rescheduled test date must fall within your assigned three-month eligibility period.

` Register six months in advance for seating and scheduling preference.
======================================
When Should I Register for the Exam?

You should plan to register as far in advance as possible ahead of your desired test date (eg, six months), but, depending on your particular test center, new dates and times may open closer to the date. Scheduling early will guarantee that you will get either your test center of choice or one within a 50-mile radius of your first choice. For most US medical students, the desired testing window correlates with the end of the preclerkship curriculum, which is around June for schools on a two-year preclerkship schedule, and around January for schools on an 18-month schedule. Thus US medical students should plan to register before January in anticipation of a June test date, or before August in anticipation of a January test date. The timing of the exam is more flexible for IMGs, as it is related only to when they finish exam preparation. Talk with upperclassmen who have already taken the test so you have real-life experience from students who went through a similar curriculum, then formulate your own strategy.

How Long Will I Have to Wait Before I Get My Result?

The USMLE reports results in three to four weeks, unless there are delays in processing. Examinees will be notified via email when their results are available. By following the online instructions, examinees will be able to view, download, and print their exam report online for ~120 days after notification, after which results can only be obtained through requesting an official USMLE transcript. Additional information about results reporting timetables and accessibility is available on the official USMLE website. Between 2020 and 2021, Step 1 pass rates dropped from 97% to 95% across US/Canadian schools and from 83% to 77% across non-US/Canadian schools (see Table 2).
======================================
What About Time?

` Gain extra break time by skipping the tutorial, or utilize the tutorial time to add personal notes to your scratch paper.

Time is of special interest on the CBT exam. Here’s a breakdown of the exam schedule:

15 minutes 7 hours 45 minutes Tutorial (skip if familiar with test format and features) Seven 60-minute question blocks Break time (includes time for lunch)

The computer will keep track of how much time has elapsed on the exam. However, the computer will show you only how much time you have remaining in a given block. Therefore, it is up to you to determine if you are pacing yourself properly (at a rate of approximately one question per 90 seconds).

The computer does not warn you if you are spending more than your allotted time for a break. You should therefore budget your time so that you can take a short break when you need one and have time to eat. You must be especially careful not to spend too much time in between blocks (you should keep track of how much time elapses from the time you finish a block of questions to the time you start the next block). After you finish one question block, you’ll need to click to proceed to the next block of questions. If you do not click within 30 seconds, you will automatically be entered into a break period.

Break time for the day is 45 minutes, but you are not required to use all of it, nor are you required to use any of it. You can gain extra break time (but not extra time for the question blocks) by skipping the tutorial or by finishing a block ahead of the allotted time. Any time remaining on the clock when you finish a block gets added to your remaining break time. Once a new question block has been started, you may not take a break until you have reached the end of that block. If you do so, this will be recorded as an “unauthorized break” and will be reported on your final exam report.

` Be careful to watch the clock on your break time.

Finally, be aware that it may take a few minutes of your break time to “check out” of the secure resting room and then “check in” again to resume testing, so plan accordingly. The “check-in” process may include fingerprints, pocket checks, and metal detector scanning. Some students recommend pocketless clothing on exam day to streamline the process.

If I Freak Out and Leave, What Happens to My Exam?

Your scheduling permit shows a CIN that you will need to enter to start your exam. Entering the CIN is the same as breaking the seal on a test book, and you are considered to have started the exam when you do so. However, no result will be reported if you do not complete the exam. If you leave at any time after starting the test, or do not open every block of your test, your test will not be scored and will be reported as incomplete. Incomplete results count toward the maximum of four attempts for each Step exam. Although a pass or fail result is not posted for incomplete tests, examinees may still be offered an option to request that their scores be calculated and reported if they desire; unanswered questions will be scored as incorrect.

The exam ends when all question blocks have been completed or when their time has expired. As you leave the testing center, you will receive a printed test-completion notice to document your completion of the exam. To receive an official score, you must finish the entire exam.

What Types of Questions Are Asked?

` Nearly three fourths of Step 1 questions begin with a description of a patient.

All questions on the exam are one-best-answer multiple choice items. Most questions consist of a clinical scenario or a direct question followed by a list of four or more options. You are required to select the single best

answer among the options given. There are no “except,” “not,” or matching questions on the exam. A number of options may be partially correct, in which case you must select the option that best answers the question or completes the statement. Additionally, keep in mind that experimental questions may appear on the exam, which do not affect your exam result.

How Is the Test Scored?

The USMLE transitioned to a pass/fail scoring system for Step 1 on January 26, 2022. Examinees now receive an electronic report that will display the outcome of either “Pass” or “Fail.” Failing reports include a graphic depiction of the distance between the examinee’s score and the minimum passing standard as well as content area feedback. Feedback for the content area shows the examinee’s performance relative to examinees with a low pass (lower, same, or higher) and should be used to guide future study plans. Passing exam reports only displays the outcome of “Pass,” along with a breakdown of topics covered on that individual examination (which will closely mirror the frequencies listed in Table 1). Note that a number of questions are experimental and are not counted toward or against the examinee’s performance.

Examinees who took the test before the transition to pass/fail reporting received an electronic report that includes the examinee’s pass/fail status, a three- digit test score, a bar chart comparing the examinee’s performance in each content area with their overall Step 1 performance, and a graphic depiction of the examinee’s performance by physician task, discipline, and organ system. Changes will not be made to transcripts containing three-digit test scores.

The USMLE does not report the minimum number of correct responses needed to pass, but estimates that it is approximately 60%. The USMLE may update exam result reporting in the future, so please check the USMLE website or www.firstaidteam.com for updates.

` Depending on the resource used, practice questions may be easier than the actual exam.
======================================
Official NBME/USMLE Resources

The NBME offers a Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) for practice that is a shorter version of the Step 1. The CBSE contains four blocks of 50 questions each and covers material that is typically learned during the basic science years. CBSE scores represent the percent of content mastered and show an estimated probability of passing Step 1. Many schools use this test to gauge whether a student is expected to pass Step 1. If this test is offered by your school, it is usually conducted at the end of regular didactic time before any dedicated Step 1 preparation. If you do not encounter the CBSE before your dedicated study time, you need not worry about taking it. Use the information to help set realistic goals and timetables for your success.

The NBME also offers six forms of Comprehensive Basic Science Self- Assessment (CBSSA). Students who prepared for the exam using this web- based tool reported that they found the format and content highly indicative of questions tested on the actual exam. In addition, the CBSSA is a fair predictor of historical USMLE performance. The test interface, however, does not match the actual USMLE test interface, so practicing with these forms alone is not advised.

The CBSSA exists in two formats: standard-paced and self-paced, both of which consist of four sections of 50 questions each (for a total of 200 multiple choice items). The standard-paced format allows the user up to 75 minutes to complete each section, reflecting time limits similar to the actual exam. By contrast, the self-paced format places a 5-hour time limit on answering all multiple choice questions. Every few years, new forms are released and older ones are retired, reflecting changes in exam content. Therefore, the newer exams tend to be more similar to the actual Step 1, and scores from these exams tend to provide a better estimation of exam day performance.

Keep in mind that this bank of questions is available only on the web. The NBME requires that users start and complete the exam within 90 days of purchase. Once the assessment has begun, users are required to complete the sections within 20 days. Following completion of the questions, the CBSSA provides a performance profile indicating the user’s relative strengths and weaknesses, much like the report profile for the USMLE Step 1 exam. In addition to the performance profile, examinees will be informed of the number of questions answered incorrectly. You will have the ability to review the text of all questions with detailed explanations. The NBME charges $60 for each assessment, payable by credit card or money order. For more information regarding the CBSE and the CBSSA, visit the NBME’s website at www.nbme.org.

The NBME scoring system is weighted for each assessment exam. While some exams seem more difficult than others, the equated percent correct reported takes into account these inter-test differences. Also, while many students report seeing Step 1 questions “word-for-word” out of the assessments, the NBME makes special note that no live USMLE questions are shown on any NBME assessment.

Lastly, the International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) offers a Basic Science Examination (BSE) practice exam at participating Prometric test centers for $200. Students may also take the self-assessment test online for $35 through the NBME’s website. The IFOM BSE is intended to determine an examinee’s relative areas of strength and weakness in general areas of basic science—not to predict performance on the USMLE Step 1 exam— and the content covered by the two examinations is somewhat different. However, because there is substantial overlap in content coverage and many IFOM items were previously used on the USMLE Step 1, it is possible to roughly project IFOM performance onto the historical USMLE Step 1 score scale. More information is available at http://www.nbme.org/ifom/.

` LEARNING STRATEGIES

Many students feel overwhelmed during the preclinical years and struggle to find an effective learning strategy. Table 3 lists several learning strategies you can try and their estimated effectiveness for Step 1 preparation based on the literature (see References). These are merely suggestions, and it’s important to take your learning preferences into account. Your comprehensive learning approach will contain a combination of strategies (eg, elaborative interrogation followed by practice testing, mnemonics review using spaced repetition, etc). Regardless of your choice, the foundation of knowledge you build during your basic science years is the most important resource for success on the USMLE Step 1.

HIGH EFFICACY

Practice Testing

` Research has shown a positive correlation between the number of boards-style practice questions completed and Step 1 performance among medical students.

Also called “retrieval practice,” practice testing has both direct and indirect benefits to the learner.4 Effortful retrieval of answers does not only identify weak spots—it directly strengthens long-term retention of material.5 The more effortful the recall, the better the long-term retention. This advantage has been shown to result in higher test scores and GPAs.6 In fact, research has shown a positive correlation between the number of boards-style practice questions completed and Step 1 performance among medical students.7

Practice testing should be done with “interleaving” (mixing of questions from different topics in a single session). Question banks often allow you to intermingle topics. Interleaved practice helps learners develop their ability to focus on the relevant concept when faced with many possibilities. Practicing topics in massed fashion (eg, all cardiology, then all dermatology) may seem intuitive, but there is strong evidence that interleaving correlates with longer- term retention and increased student achievement, especially on tasks that involve problem solving.5

In addition to using question banks, you can test yourself by arranging your notes in a question-answer format (eg, via flash cards). Testing these Q&As in random order allows you to reap the benefit of interleaved practice. Bear in mind that the utility of practice testing comes from the practice of information retrieval, so simply reading through Q&As will attenuate this benefit.

Distributed Practice

Also called “spaced repetition,” distributed practice is the opposite of massed practice or “cramming.” Learners review material at increasingly spaced out intervals (days to weeks to months). Massed learning may produce more short-term gains and satisfaction, but learners who use distributed practice have better mastery and retention over the long term.5,9

` Studies have linked spaced repetition learning with flash cards to improved long- term knowledge retention and higher exam scores.

Flash cards are a simple way to incorporate both distributed practice and practice testing. Studies have linked spaced repetition learning with flash cards to improved long-term knowledge retention and higher exam scores.6,8,10 Apps with automated spaced-repetition software (SRS) for flash cards exist for smartphones and tablets, so the cards are accessible anywhere. Proceed with caution: there is an art to making and reviewing cards. The ease of quickly downloading or creating digital cards can lead to flash card overload (it is unsustainable to make 50 flash cards per lecture!). Even at a modest pace, the thousands upon thousands of cards are too overwhelming for Step 1 preparation. Unless you have specific high-yield cards (and have checked the content with high-yield resources), stick to pre-made cards by reputable sources that curate the vast amount of knowledge for you.

If you prefer pen and paper, consider using a planner or spreadsheet to organize your study material over time. Distributed practice allows for

some forgetting of information, and the added effort of recall over time strengthens the learning.

MODERATE EFFICACY

Mnemonics

A “mnemonic” refers to any device that assists memory, such as acronyms, mental imagery (eg, keywords with or without memory palaces), etc. Keyword mnemonics have been shown to produce superior knowledge retention when compared with rote memorization in many scenarios. However, they are generally more effective when applied to memorization-heavy, keyword- friendly topics and may not be broadly suitable.5 Keyword mnemonics may not produce long-term retention, so consider combining mnemonics with distributed, retrieval-based practice (eg, via flash cards with SRS).

Self-made mnemonics may have an advantage when material is simple and keyword friendly. If you can create your own mnemonic that accurately represents the material, this will be more memorable. When topics are complex and accurate mnemonics are challenging to create, pre-made mnemonics may be more effective, especially if you are inexperienced at creating mnemonics.11

Elaborative Interrogation/Self-Explanation

Elaborative interrogation (“why” questions) and self-explanation (general questioning) prompt learners to generate explanations for facts. When reading passages of discrete facts, consider using these techniques, which have been shown to be more effective than rereading (eg, improved recall and better problem-solving/diagnostic performance).5,12,13

` Elaborative interrogation and self- explanation prompt learners to generate explanations for facts, which improves recall and problem solving.

Concept Mapping

Concept mapping is a method for graphically organizing knowledge, with concepts enclosed in boxes and lines drawn between related concepts. Creating or studying concept maps may be more effective than other activities (eg, writing or reading summaries/outlines). However, studies have reached mixed conclusions about its utility, and the small size of this effect raises doubts about its authenticity and pedagogic significance.14

LOW EFFICACY

Rereading

While the most commonly used method among surveyed students, rereading has not been shown to correlate with grade point average.9 Due to its popularity, rereading is often a comparator in studies on learning. Other

Because this method is passive, it tends to be of minimal value for learning and recall. In fact, lower-performing students are more likely to use these techniques.9 Students who highlight and underline do not learn how to actively recall learned information and thus find it difficult to apply knowledge to exam questions.

Summarization

While more useful for improving performance on generative measures (eg, free recall or essays), summarization is less useful for exams that depend on recognition (eg, multiple choice). Findings on the overall efficacy of this method have been mixed.5

` TIMELINE FOR STUDY

Before Starting

Your preparation for the USMLE Step 1 should begin when you enter medical school. Organize and commit to studying from the beginning so that when the time comes to prepare for the USMLE, you will be ready with a strong foundation.

` Customize your schedule. Tackle your weakest section first.

Make a Schedule

After you have defined your goals, map out a study schedule that is consistent with your objectives, your vacation time, the difficulty of your ongoing coursework, and your family and social commitments. Determine whether you want to spread out your study time or concentrate it into 14-hour study days in the final weeks. Then factor in your own history in preparing for standardized examinations (eg, SAT, MCAT). Talk to students at your school who have recently taken Step 1. Ask them for their study schedules, especially those who have study habits and goals similar to yours. Sample schedules can be found at https://firstaidteam.com/schedules/.

Typically, US medical schools allot between four and eight weeks for dedicated Step 1 preparation. The time you dedicate to exam preparation will depend on your confidence in comfortably achieving a passing score as well as your success in preparing yourself during the first two years of medical school. Some students reserve about a week at the end of their study period for final review; others save just a few days. When you have scheduled your exam date, do your best to adhere to it.

Make your schedule realistic, and set achievable goals. Many students make the mistake of studying at a level of detail that requires too much time for a comprehensive review—reading Gray’s Anatomy in a couple of days is not a realistic goal! Have one catch-up day per week of studying. No matter how well you stick to your schedule, unexpected events happen. But don’t let yourself procrastinate because you have catch-up days; stick to your schedule as closely as possible and revise it regularly on the basis of your actual progress. Be careful not to lose focus. Beware of feelings of inadequacy when comparing study schedules and progress with your peers. Avoid others who stress you out. Focus on a few top-rated resources that suit your learning style—not on some obscure books your friends may pass down to you. Accept the fact that you cannot learn it all.

You will need time for uninterrupted and focused study. Plan your personal affairs to minimize crisis situations near the date of the test. Allot an adequate number of breaks in your study schedule to avoid burnout. Maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper diet, exercise, and sleep.

` Avoid burnout. Maintain proper diet, exercise, and sleep habits.

Another important aspect of your preparation is your studying environment. Study where you have always been comfortable studying. Be sure to include everything you need close by (review books, notes, coffee, snacks, etc). If you’re the kind of person who cannot study alone, form a study group with other students taking the exam. The main point here is to create a comfortable environment with minimal distractions.

Year(s) Prior

The knowledge you gained during your first two years of medical school and even during your undergraduate years should provide the groundwork on which to base your test preparation. Student scores on NBME subject tests (commonly known as “shelf exams”) have been shown to be highly correlated with subsequent Step 1 performance.16 Moreover, undergraduate science GPAs as well as MCAT scores are strong predictors of performance on the Step 1 exam.17

` Buy review resources early (first year) and use while studying for courses.

We also recommend that you buy highly rated review books early in your first year of medical school and use them as you study throughout the two years. When Step 1 comes along, these books will be familiar and personalized to the way in which you learn. It is risky and intimidating to use unfamiliar review books in the final two or three weeks preceding the exam. Some students find it helpful to personalize and annotate First Aid throughout the curriculum.
======================================
Months Prior

Review test dates and the application procedure. Testing for the USMLE Step 1 is done on a year-round basis. If you have disabilities or special circumstances, contact the NBME as early as possible to discuss test accommodations (see the Section I Supplement at www.firstaidteam.com/ bonus).

` Simulate the USMLE Step 1 under “real” conditions before beginning your studies.

Use this time to finalize your ideal schedule. Consider upcoming breaks and whether you want to relax or study. Work backward from your test date to make sure you finish at least one question bank. Also add time to redo missed or flagged questions (which may be half the bank). This is the time to build a structured plan with enough flexibility for the realities of life.

Begin doing blocks of questions from reputable question banks under “real” conditions. Don’t use tutor mode until you’re sure you can finish blocks in the allotted time. It is important to continue balancing success in your normal studies with the Step 1 test preparation process.

Weeks Prior (Dedicated Preparation)

` In the final two weeks, focus on review, practice questions, and endurance. Stay confident!

Your dedicated prep time may be one week or two months. You should have a working plan as you go into this period. Finish your schoolwork strong, take a day off, and then get to work. Start by simulating a full-length USMLE Step 1 if you haven’t yet done so. Consider doing one NBME CBSSA and the free questions from the NBME website. Alternatively, you could choose 7 blocks of randomized questions from a commercial question bank. Make sure you get feedback on your strengths and weaknesses and adjust your studying accordingly. Many students study from review sources or comprehensive programs for part of the day, then do question blocks. Also, keep in mind that reviewing a question block can take upward of two hours. Feedback from CBSSA exams and question banks will help you focus on your weaknesses.
======================================
One Week Prior

` One week before the test: Sleep according to the same schedule you’ll

use on test day

Review the CBT tutorial one last time Call Prometric to confirm test date and time

Make sure you have your CIN (found on your scheduling permit) as well as other items necessary for the day of the examination, including a current driver’s license or another form of photo ID with your signature (make sure the name on your ID exactly matches that on your scheduling permit). Confirm the Prometric testing center location and test time. Work out how you will get to the testing center and what parking, traffic, and public transportation problems you might encounter. Exchange cell phone numbers with other students taking the test on the same day in case of emergencies. Check www.prometric.com/closures for test site closures due to unforeseen events. Determine what you will do for lunch. Make sure you have everything you need to ensure that you will be comfortable and alert at the test site. It may be beneficial to adjust your schedule to start waking up at the same time that you will on your test day. And of course, make sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle and get enough sleep.

One Day Prior

Try your best to relax and rest the night before the test. Double-check your admissions and test-taking materials as well as the comfort measures discussed earlier so that you will not have to deal with such details on the morning of the exam. At this point it will be more effective to review short-term memory

material that you’re already familiar with than to try to learn new material. The Rapid Review section at the end of this book is high yield for last-minute studying. Remember that regardless of how hard you have studied, you cannot (and need not!) know everything. There will be things on the exam that you have never even seen before, so do not panic. Do not underestimate your abilities.

Many students report difficulty sleeping the night prior to the exam. This is often exacerbated by going to bed much earlier than usual. Do whatever it takes to ensure a good night’s sleep (eg, massage, exercise, warm milk, no screens at night). Do not change your daily routine prior to the exam. Exam day is not the day for a caffeine-withdrawal headache.
======================================
Morning of the Exam

On the morning of the Step 1 exam, wake up at your regular time and eat a normal breakfast. If you think it will help you, have a close friend or family member check to make sure you get out of bed. Make sure you have your scheduling permit admission ticket, test-taking materials, and comfort measures as discussed earlier. Wear loose, comfortable clothing. Limiting the number of pockets in your outfit may save time during security screening. Plan for a variable temperature in the testing center. Arrive at the test site 30 minutes before the time designated on the admission ticket; however, do not come too early, as doing so may intensify your anxiety. When you arrive at the test site, the proctor should give you a USMLE information sheet that will explain critical factors such as the proper use of break time. Seating may be assigned, but ask to be reseated if necessary; you need to be seated in an area that will allow you to remain comfortable and to concentrate. Get to know your testing station, especially if you have never been in a Prometric testing center before. Listen to your proctors regarding any changes in instructions or testing procedures that may apply to your test site.

` No notes, books, calculators, pagers, cell phones, recording devices, or watches of any kind are allowed in the testing area, but they are allowed in lockers and may be accessed during authorized breaks.

` Arrive at the testing center 30 minutes before your scheduled exam time. If you arrive more than half an hour late, you will not be allowed to take the test.

If you are experiencing symptoms of illness on the day of your exam, we strongly recommend you reschedule. If you become ill or show signs of illness (eg, persistent cough) during the exam, the test center may prohibit you from completing the exam due to health and safety risks for test center staff and other examinees.

Finally, remember that it is natural (and even beneficial) to be a little nervous. Focus on being mentally clear and alert. Avoid panic. When you are asked to begin the exam, take a deep breath, focus on the screen, and then begin. Keep an eye on the timer. Take advantage of breaks between blocks to stretch, maybe do some jumping jacks, and relax for a moment with deep breathing or stretching.
======================================
After the Test

After you have completed the exam, be sure to have fun and relax regardless of how you may feel. Taking the test is an achievement in itself. Remember,

you are much more likely to have passed than not. Enjoy the free time you have before your clerkships. Expect to experience some “reentry” phenomena as you try to regain a real life. Once you have recovered sufficiently from the test (or from partying), we invite you to send us your feedback, corrections, and suggestions for entries, facts, mnemonics, strategies, resource ratings, and the like (see p. xvii, How to Contribute). Sharing your experience will benefit fellow medical students.

` STUDY MATERIALS

Quality Considerations

Although an ever-increasing number of review books and software are now available on the market, the quality of such material is highly variable. Some common problems are as follows:

Certain review books are too detailed to allow for review in a reasonable amount of time or cover subtopics that are not emphasized on the exam. Many sample question books were originally written years ago and have

not been adequately updated to reflect recent trends.

Some question banks test to a level of detail that you will not find on the exam.

Review Books

` If a given review book is not working for you, stop using it no matter how highly rated it may be or how much it costs.

In selecting review books, be sure to weigh different opinions against each other, read the reviews and ratings in Section IV of this guide, examine the books closely in the bookstore, and choose carefully. You are investing not only money but also your limited study time. Do not worry about finding the “perfect” book, as many subjects simply do not have one, and different students prefer different formats. Supplement your chosen books with personal notes from other sources, including what you learn from question banks.

` Charts and diagrams may be the best approach for physiology and biochemistry, whereas tables and outlines may be preferable for microbiology.

There are two types of review books: those that are stand-alone titles and those that are part of a series. Books in a series generally have the same style, and you must decide if that style works for you. However, a given style is not optimal for every subject.

You should also find out which books are up to date. Some recent editions reflect major improvements, whereas others contain only cursory changes. Take into consideration how a book reflects the format of the USMLE Step 1.
======================================
Apps

With the explosion of smartphones and tablets, apps are an increasingly popular way to review for the Step 1 exam. The majority of apps are compatible with both iOS and Android. Many popular Step 1 review resources (eg, UWorld, USMLE-Rx) have apps that are compatible with

Sec tion i

their software. Many popular web references (eg, UpToDate) also now offer app versions. All of these apps offer flexibility, allowing you to study while away from a computer (eg, while traveling).

Practice Tests

Taking practice tests provides valuable information about potential strengths and weaknesses in your fund of knowledge and test-taking skills. Some students use practice examinations simply as a means of breaking up the monotony of studying and adding variety to their study schedule, whereas other students rely almost solely on practice. You should also subscribe to one or more high-quality question banks.

` Most practice exams are shorter and less clinical than the real thing.

Additionally, some students preparing for the Step 1 exam have started to incorporate case-based books intended primarily for clinical students on the wards or studying for the Step 2 CK exam. First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1 aims to directly address this need.

After taking a practice test, spend time on each question and each answer choice whether you were right or wrong. There are important teaching points in each explanation. Knowing why a wrong answer choice is incorrect is just as important as knowing why the right answer is correct. Do not panic if your practice scores are low as many questions try to trick or distract you to highlight a certain point. Use the questions you missed or were unsure about to develop focused plans during your scheduled catch-up time.

` Use practice tests to identify concepts and areas of weakness, not just facts that you missed.
======================================
Textbooks and Course Syllabi

Limit your use of textbooks and course syllabi for Step 1 review. Many textbooks are too detailed for high-yield review and include material that is generally not tested on the USMLE Step 1 (eg, drug dosages, complex chemical structures). Syllabi, although familiar, are inconsistent across medical schools and frequently reflect the emphasis of individual faculty, which often does not correspond to that of the USMLE Step 1. Syllabi also tend to be less organized than top-rated books and generally contain fewer diagrams and study questions.

` TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES

Your test performance will be influenced by both your knowledge and your test-taking skills. You can strengthen your performance by considering each of these factors. Test-taking skills and strategies should be developed and perfected well in advance of the test date so that you can concentrate on the test itself. We suggest that you try the following strategies to see if they might work for you.

` Practice! Develop your test-taking skills and strategies well before the test date.

Pacing

` Time management is an important skill for exam success.

You have seven hours to complete up to 280 questions. Note that each one- hour block contains up to 40 questions. This works out to approximately 90 seconds per question. We recommend following the “1 minute rule” to pace yourself. Spend no more than 1 minute on each question. If you are still unsure about the answer after this time, mark the question, make an educated guess, and move on. Following this rule, you should have approximately 20 minutes left after all questions are answered, which you can use to revisit all of your marked questions. Remember that some questions may be experimental and do not count for points (and reassure yourself that these experimental questions are the ones that are stumping you). In the past, pacing errors have been detrimental to the performance of even highly prepared examinees. The bottom line is to keep one eye on the clock at all times!
======================================
Dealing with Each Question

There are several established techniques for efficiently approaching multiple choice questions; find what works for you. One technique begins with identifying each question as easy, workable, or impossible. Your goal should be to answer all easy questions, resolve all workable questions in a reasonable amount of time, and make quick and intelligent guesses on all impossible questions. Most students read the stem, think of the answer, and turn immediately to the choices. A second technique is to first skim the answer choices to get a context, then read the last sentence of the question (the lead-in), and then read through the passage quickly, extracting only information relevant to answering the question. This can be particularly helpful for questions with long clinical vignettes. Try a variety of techniques on practice exams and see what works best for you. If you get overwhelmed, remember that a 30-second time out to refocus may get you back on track.

Guessing

There is no penalty for wrong answers. Thus no test block should be left with unanswered questions. If you don’t know the answer, first eliminate incorrect choices, then guess among the remaining options. Note that dozens of questions are unscored experimental questions meant to obtain statistics for future exams. Therefore, some questions may seem unusual or unreasonably difficult simply because they are part of the development process for future exams.

Changing Your Answer

The conventional wisdom is not to second-guess your initial answers. However, studies have consistently shown that test takers are more likely to change from a wrong answer to the correct answer than the other way around. Many question banks tell you how many questions you changed from right to wrong, wrong to wrong, and wrong to right. Use this feedback

to judge how good a second-guesser you are. If you have extra time, reread the question stem and make sure you didn’t misinterpret the question.

` Go with your first hunch, unless you are certain that you are a good second-guesser.

` CLINICAL VIGNETTE STRATEGIES

In recent years, the USMLE Step 1 has become increasingly clinically oriented. This change mirrors the trend in medical education toward introducing students to clinical problem solving during the basic science years. The increasing clinical emphasis on Step 1 may be challenging to those students who attend schools with a more traditional curriculum.

` Be prepared to read fast and think on your feet!

What Is a Clinical Vignette?

A clinical vignette is a short (usually paragraph-long) description of a patient, including demographics, presenting symptoms, signs, and other information concerning the patient. Sometimes this paragraph is followed by a brief listing of important physical findings and/or laboratory results. The task of assimilating all this information and answering the associated question in the span of one minute can be intimidating. So be prepared to read quickly and think on your feet. Remember that the question is often indirectly asking something you already know.

` Practice questions that include case histories or descriptive vignettes are critical for Step 1 preparation.

A pseudovignette is a question that includes a description of a case similar to that of a clinical vignette, but it ends with a declarative recall question; thus the material presented in the pseudovignette is not necessary to answer the question. Question writers strive to avoid pseudovignettes on the USMLE Step 1. Be prepared to tackle each vignette as if the information presented is important to answer the associated question correctly.

Strategy

Remember that Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in their most classic presentation. So look for cardinal signs (eg, malar rash for lupus or nuchal rigidity for meningitis) in the narrative history. Be aware that the question will contain classic signs and symptoms instead of buzzwords. Sometimes the data from labs and the physical exam will help you confirm or reject possible diagnoses, thereby helping you rule answer choices in or out. In some cases, they will be a dead giveaway for the diagnosis.

` Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in their most classic presentation.

Making a diagnosis from the history and data is often not the final answer. Not infrequently, the diagnosis is divulged at the end of the vignette, after you have just struggled through the narrative to come up with a diagnosis of your own. The question might then ask about a related aspect of the diagnosed disease. Consider skimming the answer choices and lead-in before diving into a long stem. However, be careful with skimming the answer choices; going too fast may warp your perception of what the vignette is asking.

` IF YOU THINK YOU FAILED

After taking the test, it is normal for many examinees to feel unsure about their performance, despite the majority of them achieving a passing score. Historical pass data is in Table 2. If you remain quite concerned, it may be wise to prepare a course of action should you need to retest. There are several sensible steps you can take to plan for the future in the event that you do not achieve a passing score. First, save and organize all your study materials, including review books, practice tests, and notes. Familiarize yourself with the reapplication procedures for Step 1, including application deadlines and upcoming test dates.

` If you pass Step 1, you are not allowed to retake the exam.

Make sure you know both your school’s and the NBME’s policies regarding retakes. The total number of attempts an examinee may take per Step examination is four.18 You make take Step 1 no more than three times within a 12-month period. Your fourth attempt must be at least 12 months after your first attempt at that exam, and at least 6 months after your most recent attempt at that exam.

If you failed, the performance profiles on the back of the USMLE Step 1 score report provide valuable feedback concerning your relative strengths and weaknesses. Study these profiles closely. Set up a study timeline to strengthen gaps in your knowledge as well as to maintain and improve what you already know. Do not neglect high-yield subjects. It is normal to feel somewhat anxious about retaking the test, but if anxiety becomes a problem, seek appropriate counseling.

HIGH-YIELD GENERAL PRINCIPLES

` HOW TO USE THE DATABASE

The 2023 edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 contains a revised and expanded database of basic science material that students, student authors, and faculty authors have identified as high yield for board review. The information is presented in a partially organ-based format. Hence, Section II is devoted to the foundational principles of biochemistry, microbiology, immunology, basic pathology, basic pharmacology, and public health sciences. Section III focuses on organ systems, with subsections covering the embryology, anatomy and histology, physiology, clinical pathology, and clinical pharmacology relevant to each. Each subsection is then divided into smaller topic areas containing related facts. Individual facts are generally presented in a three-column format, with the Title of the fact in the first column, the Description of the fact in the second column, and the Mnemonic or Special Note in the third column. Some facts do not have a mnemonic and are presented in a two-column format. Others are presented in list or tabular form in order to emphasize key associations.

The database structure used in Sections II and III is useful for reviewing material already learned. These sections are not ideal for learning complex or highly conceptual material for the first time.

The database of high-yield facts is not comprehensive. Use it to complement your core study mate rial and not as your primary study source. The facts and notes have been condensed and edited to emphasize the high-yield material, and as a result, each entry is “incomplete” and arguably “over-simplified.” Often, the more you research a topic, the more complex it becomes, with certain topics resisting simplification. Determine your most efficient methods for learning the material, and do not be afraid to abandon a strategy if it is not working for you.

Our database of high-yield facts is updated annually to keep current with new trends in boards emphasis, including clinical relevance. However, we must note that inevitably many other high-yield topics are not yet included in our database.

We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit high-yield topics, well-written entries, diagrams, clinical images, and useful mnemonics so that we may enhance the database for future students. We also solicit recommendations of alternate tools for study that may be useful in preparing for the examination, such as charts, flash cards, apps, and online resources (see How to Contribute, p. xv).

This high-yield material includes molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, and principles of metabolism (especially vitamins, cofactors, minerals, and single-enzyme-deficiency diseases). When studying metabolic pathways, emphasize important regulatory steps and enzyme deficiencies that result in disease, as well as reactions targeted by pharmacologic interventions. For example, understanding the defect in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its clinical consequences is higher yield than memorizing every intermediate in the purine salvage pathway.

Do not spend time learning details of organic chemistry, mechanisms, or physical chemistry. Detailed chemical structures are infrequently tested; however, many structures have been included here to help students learn reactions and the important enzymes involved. Familiarity with the biochemical techniques that have medical relevance—such as immunoelectrophoresis, Southern blotting, and PCR—is ELISA, useful. Review the related biochemistry when studying pharmacology or genetic diseases as a way to reinforce and integrate the material.

Chromatin structure

DNA exists in the condensed, chromatin form to fit into the nucleus. DNA loops twice around a histone octamer to form a nucleosome (“beads on a string”). H1 binds to the nucleosome and to “linker DNA,” thereby stabilizing the chromatin fiber.

DNA has ⊝ charge from phosphate groups. Histones are large and have ⊕ charge from lysine and arginine. In mitosis, DNA condenses to form chromosomes. DNA and histone synthesis occurs during S phase. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is circular and does not utilize histones.

Mutations in DNA Degree of change: silent << missense < nonsense < frameshift. Single nucleotide substitutions are

repaired by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. Types of single nucleotide (point) mutations: Transition—purine to purine (eg, A to G) or pyrimidine to pyrimidine (eg, C to T). Transversion—purine to pyrimidine (eg, A to T) or pyrimidine to purine (eg, C to G).
======================================
Single nucleotide substitutions

Silent mutation

Codes for same (synonymous) amino acid; often involves 3rd position of codon (tRNA wobble).

Missense mutation

Results in changed amino acid (called conservative if new amino acid has similar chemical

structure). Examples: sickle cell disease (substitution of glutamic acid with valine).

Nonsense mutation Results in early stop codon (UGA, UAA, UAG). Usually generates nonfunctional protein. Stop the nonsense!

Other mutations

Frameshift mutation Deletion or insertion of any number of nucleotides not divisible by 3 misreading of all nucleotides downstream. Protein may be shorter or longer, and its function may be disrupted or altered. Examples: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis.

Splice site mutation Retained intron in mRNA protein with impaired or altered function. Examples: rare causes of cancers, dementia, epilepsy, some types of β-thalassemia, Gaucher disease, Marfan syndrome.

Lac operon

Classic example of a genetic response to an environmental change. Glucose is the preferred

metabolic substrate in E coli, but when glucose is absent and lactose is available, the lac operon is activated to switch to lactose metabolism. Mechanism of shift: Low glucose adenylate cyclase activity generation of cAMP from ATP activation of

catabolite activator protein (CAP) transcription.

High lactose unbinds repressor protein from repressor/operator site transcription.

Initial transcript is called heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). hnRNA is then modified and becomes mRNA.

The following processes occur in the nucleus:

Poly-A polymerase does not require a template. AAUAAA = polyadenylation signal. Mutation in polyadenylation signal early degradation prior to translation. Kozak sequence—initiation site in most eukaryotic mRNA. Facilitates binding of small subunit of ribosome to mRNA. Mutations in sequence impairment of initiation of translation protein synthesis.

Splicing out of introns (posttranscriptional) Capped, tailed, and spliced transcript is called

mRNA.

mRNA is transported out of nucleus to be translated in cytosol.

mRNA quality control occurs at cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), which contain exonucleases, decapping enzymes, and microRNAs; mRNAs may be degraded or stored in P-bodies for future translation.

Introns vs exons

Exons contain the actual genetic information coding for protein or functional RNA. Introns do not code for protein, but are important in regulation of gene expression. Different exons are frequently combined by alternative splicing to produce a larger number of unique proteins.

Introns are intervening sequences and stay in the nucleus, whereas exons exit and are expressed.

Alternative splicing—can produce a variety of protein products from a single hnRNA (heterogenous nuclear RNA) sequence (eg, transmembrane vs secreted Ig, tropomyosin variants in muscle, dopamine receptors in the brain, host defense evasion by tumor cells).

Splicing of pre-mRNA Part of process by which precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is transformed into mature mRNA. Introns

typically begin with GU and end with AG. Alterations in snRNP assembly can cause clinical disease; eg, in spinal muscular atrophy, snRNP assembly is affected due to SMN protein congenital degeneration of anterior horns of spinal cord symmetric weakness (hypotonia, or “floppy baby syndrome”).

snRNPs are snRNA bound to proteins (eg, Smith [Sm]) to form a spliceosome that cleaves pre- mRNA. Anti-U1 snRNP antibodies are associated with SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, other rheumatic diseases.

tRNA

Structure

75–90 nucleotides, 2º structure, cloverleaf form, anticodon end is opposite 3′ aminoacyl end. All tRNAs, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, have CCA at 3′ end along with a high percentage of chemically modified bases. The amino acid is covalently bound to the 3′ end of the tRNA. CCA Can Carry Amino acids.

T-arm: contains the TΨC (ribothymidine, pseudouridine, cytidine) sequence necessary for tRNA- ribosome binding. T-arm Tethers tRNA molecule to ribosome.

D-arm: contains Dihydrouridine residues necessary for tRNA recognition by the correct aminoacyl- tRNA synthetase. D-arm allows Detection of the tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Attachment site: 3′-ACC-5′ is the amino acid ACCeptor site.

Charging Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (uses ATP; 1 unique enzyme per respective amino acid) and binding of charged tRNA to the codon are responsible for the accuracy of amino acid selection. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase matches an amino acid to the tRNA by scrutinizing the amino acid before and after it binds to tRNA. If an incorrect amino acid is attached, the bond is hydrolyzed. A mischarged tRNA reads the usual codon but inserts the wrong amino acid.

Protein synthesis

Eukaryotes: 40S + 60S 80S (even). Prokaryotes: 30S + 50S 70S (prime). Synthesis occurs from N-terminus to C-terminus.

Initiation

1. Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) identify the 5′ cap.

2. eIFs help assemble the 40S ribosomal subunit with the initiator tRNA.

3. eIFs released when the mRNA and the ribosomal 60S subunit assemble with the complex. Requires GTP.

ATP—tRNA Activation (charging). GTP—tRNA Gripping and Going places (translocation).

Elongation

Aminoacyl-tRNA binds to A site (except for initiator methionine, which binds the P site), requires an elongation factor and GTP. rRNA (“ribozyme”) catalyzes peptide bond formation, transfers growing polypeptide to amino acid in A site. Ribosome advances 3 nucleotides toward 3′ end of mRNA, moving peptidyl tRNA to P site (translocation).

Think of “going APE”:

A site = incoming Aminoacyl-tRNA. P site = accommodates growing Peptide. E site = holds Empty tRNA as it Exits.

Elongation factors are targets of bacterial toxins (eg, Diphtheria, Pseudomonas).

Shine-Dalgarno sequence—ribosomal binding site in prokaryotic mRNA. Recognized by 16S RNA in ribosomal subunit. Enables protein synthesis initiation by aligning ribosome with start codon so that code is read correctly.

Termination Eukaryotic release factors (eRFs) recognize the stop codon and halt translation completed polypeptide is released from ribosome. Requires GTP.

Covalent alterations Phosphorylation, glycosylation, hydroxylation, methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination.

Chaperone protein Intracellular protein involved in facilitating and maintaining protein folding. In yeast, heat shock proteins (eg, HSP60) are constitutively expressed, but expression may increase with high temperatures, acidic pH, and hypoxia to prevent protein denaturing/misfolding.

Cell cycle phases Checkpoints control transitions between phases of cell cycle. This process is regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and tumor suppressors. M phase (shortest phase of cell cycle) includes mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) and cytokinesis (cytoplasm splits in two). G1 is of variable duration.

REGUlATION OF CEll CYClE

Cyclin-dependent kinases

Constitutively expressed but inactive when not bound to cyclin.

Cyclin-CDK complexes Cyclins are phase-specific regulatory proteins that activate CDKs when stimulated by growth

factors. The cyclin-CDK complex can then phosphorylate other proteins (eg, Rb) to coordinate cell cycle progression. This complex must be activated/inactivated at appropriate times for cell cycle to progress.

Tumor suppressors

p53 p21 induction CDK inhibition Rb hypophosphorylation (activation) G1-S

progression inhibition. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes can result in unrestrained cell division (eg, Li-Fraumeni syndrome).

Growth factors (eg, insulin, PDGF, EPO, EGF) bind tyrosine kinase receptors to transition the cell

from G1 to S phase.

CEll TYPES

Rough endoplasmic reticulum

Site of synthesis of secretory (exported) proteins and of N-linked oligosaccharide addition to lysosomal and other proteins.

N-linked glycosylation occurs in the

eNdoplasmic reticulum.

Mucus-secreting goblet cells of small intestine and antibody-secreting plasma cells are rich in RER.

Nissl bodies (RER in neurons)—synthesize peptide neurotransmitters for secretion.

Proteins within organelles (eg, ER, Golgi bodies, lysosomes) are formed in RER.

Free ribosomes—unattached to any membrane; site of synthesis of cytosolic, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial proteins.

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum Site of steroid synthesis and detoxification of drugs and poisons. Lacks surface ribosomes. Location of glucose-6-phosphatase (last step in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis).

Hepatocytes and steroid hormone–producing cells of the adrenal cortex and gonads are rich in SER.

Golgi is distribution center for proteins and lipids from ER to vesicles and plasma membrane. Posttranslational events in GOlgi include modifying N-oligosaccharides on asparagine, adding O-oligosaccharides on serine and threonine, and adding mannose-6-phosphate to proteins for lysosomal and other proteins.

Cell trafficking

Endosomes are sorting centers for material from outside the cell or from the Golgi, sending it to lysosomes for destruction or back to the membrane/Golgi for further use.

I-cell disease (inclusion cell disease/mucolipidosis type II)—inherited lysosomal storage disorder (autosomal recessive); defect in N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase failure of the Golgi to phosphorylate mannose residues ( mannose-6-phosphate) on glycoproteins enzymes secreted extracellularly rather than delivered to lysosomes lysosomes deficient in digestive enzymes buildup of cellular debris in lysosomes (inclusion bodies). Results in coarse facial features, gingival hyperplasia, corneal clouding, restricted joint movements, claw hand deformities, kyphoscoliosis, and plasma levels of lysosomal enzymes. Symptoms similar to but more severe than Hurler syndrome. Often fatal in childhood.

Signal recognition particle (SRP)—abundant, cytosolic ribonucleoprotein that traffics polypeptide-ribosome complex from the cytosol to the RER. Absent or dysfunctional SRP accumulation of protein in cytosol.

white matter of brain)

Zellweger syndrome—autosomal recessive disorder of peroxisome biogenesis due to mutated PEX genes. Hypotonia, seizures, jaundice, craniofacial dysmorphia, hepatomegaly, early death.

Refsum disease—autosomal recessive disorder of α-oxidation buildup of phytanic acid due to inability to degrade it. Scaly skin, ataxia, cataracts/night blindness, shortening of 4th toe, epiphyseal dysplasia. Treatment: diet, plasmapheresis.

Adrenoleukodystrophy—X-linked recessive disorder of β-oxidation due to mutation in ABCD1 gene VLCFA buildup in adrenal glands, white (leuko) matter of brain, testes. Progressive disease that can lead to adrenal gland crisis, progressive loss of neurologic function, death.

Proteasome

Barrel-shaped protein complex that degrades polyubiquitin-tagged proteins. Plays a role in many cellular processes, including immune response (MHC I–mediated). Defects in ubiquitin-proteasome system also implicated in diverse human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases.

Microtubule

Microtubule

Positive    end (+)  Heterodimer  Protoﬁlament  Negative    end (–) 

helical array of polymerized heterodimers of α- and β-tubulin. Each dimer has 2 GTP bound. Incorporated into flagella, cilia, mitotic spindles. Also involved in slow axoplasmic transport in neurons.

Molecular motor proteins—transport cellular cargo toward opposite ends of microtubule. Retrograde to microtubule (+ −)—dynein. Anterograde to microtubule (− +)—kinesin.

Clostridium tetani toxin, poliovirus, rabies virus, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) use dynein for retrograde transport to the neuronal cell body. HSV reactivation occurs via anterograde transport from cell body (kinesin mediated). Slow anterograde transport rate limiting step of peripheral nerve regeneration after injury.

Drugs that act on microtubules (microtubules

get constructed very terribly): Mebendazole (antihelminthic) Griseofulvin (antifungal) Colchicine (antigout) Vinca alkaloids (anticancer) Taxanes (anticancer) Negative end near nucleus. Positive end points to periphery.

Cilia structure

Motile cilia consist of 9 doublet + 2 singlet arrangement of microtubules (axoneme) A . Basal body (base of cilium below cell membrane) consists of 9 microtubule triplets B with no central microtubules.

Nonmotile (primary) cilia work as chemical signal sensors and have a role in signal transduction and cell growth control. Dysgenesis may lead to polycystic kidney disease, mitral valve prolapse, or retinal degeneration.

Axonemal dynein—ATPase that links peripheral 9 doublets and causes bending of cilium by differential sliding of doublets.

Gap junctions enable coordinated ciliary movement.

Autosomal recessive. Dynein arm defect immotile cilia dysfunctional ciliated epithelia. Most common type is Kartagener syndrome (PCD with situs inversus).

Developmental abnormalities due to impaired migration and orientation (eg, situs inversus A , hearing loss due to dysfunctional eustachian tube cilia); recurrent infections (eg, sinusitis, ear infections, bronchiectasis due to impaired ciliary clearance of debris/pathogens); infertility ( risk of ectopic pregnancy due to dysfunctional fallopian tube cilia, immotile spermatozoa).

Na+/K+-ATPase is located in the plasma membrane with ATP site on cytosolic side. For each ATP consumed, 2 K+ go in to the cell (pump dephosphorylated) and 3 Na+ go out of the cell (pump phosphorylated).

The DNA or RNA samples being compared are attached to different fluorophores and hybridized to the array. The ratio of fluorescence signal at a particular oligonucleotide reflects the relative amount of the hybridizing nucleic acid in the two samples.

Used to compare the relative transcription of genes in two RNA samples. Can detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) for genotyping, clinical genetic testing, forensic analysis, and cancer mutation and genetic linkage analysis when DNA is used.

Immunologic test used to detect the presence of either a specific antigen or antibody in a patient’s blood sample. Detection involves the use of an antibody linked to an enzyme. Added substrate reacts with the enzyme, producing a detectable signal. Can have high sensitivity and specificity, but is less specific than Western blot. Often used to screen for HIV infection.

Hardy-Weinberg principle
======================================
Ina

given population where mating is at

random, allele and genotype frequencies will be constant. If p and q represent the frequencies of alleles A and a in a population, respectively, then p + q = 1, where: p2 = frequency of homozygosity for allele A q2 = frequency of homozygosity for allele a 2pq = frequency of heterozygosity (carrier

frequency, if an autosomal recessive disease)

Therefore the sum of the frequencies of these genotypes is p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.

The frequency of an X-linked recessive disease in males = q and in females = q2.

Hardy-Weinberg law assumptions include: No mutation occurring at the locus Natural selection is not occurring Completely random mating No net migration Large population

If a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, then the values of p and q remain constant from generation to generation. In rare autosomal recessive diseases, p ≈ 1. Example: The prevalence of cystic fibrosis (an autosomal recessive disease) in the US is approximately 1/3200, which tells us that q2 = 1/3200, with q ≈ 0.017 or 1.7% of the population. Since p + q = 1, we know that p = 1 – √1/3200 ≈ 0.982, which gives us a heterozygous carrier frequency of 2pq = 0.035 or 3.5% of the population. Notice that since the disease is relatively rare, we could have approximated p ≈ 1 and obtained a similar result.

Disorders of imprinting One gene copy is silenced by methylation, and only the other copy is expressed parent-of-origin effects. The expressed copy may be mutated, may not be expressed, or may be deleted altogether.

Bruton agammaglobulinemia, Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, Fabry disease, G6PD deficiency, hemophilia A and B, Hunter syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, ocular albinism, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Females with Turner syndrome (45,XO) are more likely to have an X-linked recessive disorder. X-inactivation (lyonization)—during development, one of the X chromosomes in each XX cell is randomly deactivated and condensed into a Barr body (methylated heterochromatin). If skewed inactivation occurs, XX individuals may express X-linked recessive diseases (eg, G6PD); penetrance and severity of X-linked dominant diseases in XX individuals may also be impacted.

X-linked recessive diseases

Muscular dystrophies

Duchenne

Duchenne = deleted dystrophin. Dystrophin gene (DMD) is the largest protein-coding human gene chance of spontaneous mutation. Dystrophin helps to anchor muscle fibers to the extracellular matrix, primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Loss of dystrophin myonecrosis. CK and aldolase; genetic testing confirms diagnosis.

X-linked recessive disorder typically due to

frameshift deletions or nonsense mutations truncated or absent dystrophin protein progressive myofiber damage. Can also result from splicing errors.

Weakness begins in pelvic girdle muscles and progresses superiorly. Pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles due to fibrofatty replacement of muscle A . Waddling gait.

Onset before 5 years of age. Dilated

Calf pseudohypertrophy  Lordosis  Thigh atrophy  Pushing on leg to stand 

cardiomyopathy is common cause of death.

Gowers sign—patient uses upper extremities to help stand up. Classically seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but also seen in other muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies (eg, polymyositis).

Becker X-linked recessive disorder typically due to non-frameshift deletions in dystrophin gene (partially functional instead of truncated). Less severe than Duchenne (Becker is better). Onset in adolescence or early adulthood.

Deletions can cause both Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. 2⁄3 of cases have large deletions spanning one or more exons.

Autosomal dominant. Onset 20–30 years. CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DMPK gene abnormal expression of myotonin protein kinase myotonia (eg, difficulty releasing hand from handshake), muscle wasting, cataracts, testicular atrophy, frontal balding, arrhythmia.

Cataracts, Toupee (early balding in males), Gonadal atrophy.

Mitochondrial diseases Rare disorders arising 2° to failure in oxidative phosphorylation. Tissues with energy requirements are preferentially affected (eg, CNS, skeletal muscle).

Mitochondrial myopathies—include MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes) and MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers). Light microscopy with stain: ragged red fibers due to compensatory proliferation of mitochondria. Electron microscopy: mitochondrial crystalline inclusions.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy—mutations in complex I of ETC neuronal death in retina and optic nerve subacute bilateral vision loss in teens/young adults (males > females). Usually permanent. May be accompanied by neurologic dysfunction (eg, tremors, multiple sclerosis–like illness).

Rett syndrome Sporadic disorder caused by de novo mutation of MECP2 on X chromosome. Seen mostly in females. Embryonically lethal in males. Individuals with Rett syndrome experience initial normal development (6–18 months) followed by regression (“retturn”) in motor, verbal, and cognitive abilities; ataxia; seizures; scoliosis; and stereotypic hand-wringing.

Fragile X syndrome

X-linked dominant inheritance. Trinucleotide repeats in FMR1 hypermethylation of cytosine residues expression.

Most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (Down syndrome is most common genetic cause, but most cases occur sporadically).

Trinucleotide repeat expansion [(CGG)n] occurs during oogenesis. Premutation (50–200 repeats) tremor, ataxia, 1° ovarian insufficiency. Full mutation (>200 repeats) postpubertal macroorchidism (enlarged testes), long face with large jaw, large everted ears, autism, mitral valve prolapse, hypermobile joints. Self-mutilation is common and can be confused with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

May show genetic anticipation (disease severity and age of onset in successive generations). Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases

Genetic disorders by chromosome

Robertsonian translocation

Chromosomal translocation that commonly involves chromosome pairs 21, 22, 13, 14, and 15. One of the most common types of translocation. Occurs when the long arms of 2 acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with centromeres near their ends) fuse at the centromere and the 2 short arms are lost.

Balanced translocations (no gain or loss of significant genetic material) normally do not cause abnormal phenotype. Unbalanced translocations (missing or extra genes) can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, and chromosomal imbalance (eg, Down syndrome, Patau syndrome).

Nicotinamides (NAD+, NADP+ from vitamin B3) and flavin nucleotides (FAD from vitamin B2). NAD+ is generally used in catabolic processes to carry reducing equivalents away as NADH.

Universal electron acceptors

NADPH is a product of the HMP shunt. NADPH is used in:

Anabolic processes Respiratory burst Cytochrome P-450 system Glutathione reductase

NADPH is used in anabolic processes (eg,

steroid and fatty acid synthesis) as a supply of reducing equivalents.

Hexokinase vs glucokinase

Phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by glucokinase in the liver and hexokinase in other tissues. Hexokinase sequesters glucose in tissues, where it is used even when glucose concentrations are low. At high glucose concentrations, glucokinase helps to store glucose in liver. Glucokinase deficiency is a cause of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and gestational diabetes.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex

Mitochondrial enzyme complex linking glycolysis and TCA cycle. Differentially regulated in fed (active)/fasting (inactive) states. Reaction: pyruvate + NAD+ + CoA acetyl- CoA + CO2 + NADH. Contains 3 enzymes requiring 5 cofactors: 1. Thiamine pyrophosphate (B1) 2. Lipoic acid 3. CoA (B5, pantothenic acid) 4. FAD (B2, riboflavin) 5. NAD+ (B3, niacin) Activated by: NAD+/NADH ratio, ADP

The complex is similar to the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (same cofactors, similar substrate and action), which converts α-ketoglutarate succinyl-CoA (TCA cycle).

The lovely coenzymes for nerds. Arsenic inhibits lipoic acid. Arsenic poisoning clinical findings: imagine a vampire (pigmentary skin changes, skin cancer), vomiting and having diarrhea, running away from a cutie (QT prolongation) with garlic breath.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency

Causes a buildup of pyruvate that gets shunted to lactate (via LDH) and alanine (via ALT). X-linked.

Neurologic defects, lactic acidosis, serum alanine starting in infancy.

FINDINGS

intake of ketogenic nutrients (eg, high fat content or lysine and leucine).

TREATMENT

Pyruvate metabolism

Functions of different pyruvate metabolic pathways (and their associated cofactors):

Glucose  Pyruvate  A L T  LDH  NADH + H+  Alanine Cahill cycle  Cytosol Mitochondria  NAD+  Lactate Cori cycle  C P  P  NAD+  D  H  CO2 + ATP  CO2  NADH + H+  Oxaloacetate  Acetyl-CoA 

Alanine aminotransferase (B6): alanine carries amino groups to the liver from muscle Pyruvate carboxylase (B7): oxaloacetate can replenish TCA cycle or be used in gluconeogenesis Pyruvate dehydrogenase (B1, B2, B3, B5, lipoic acid): transition from glycolysis to the TCA cycle Lactic acid dehydrogenase (B3): end of anaerobic glycolysis (major pathway in RBCs, WBCs, kidney medulla, lens, testes, and cornea)

TCA cycle

Also called Krebs cycle. Pyruvate acetyl-CoA produces 1 NADH, 1 CO2.

produces 1 NADH, 1 CO2. The TCA cycle produces 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, 2 CO2, 1 GTP per acetyl-CoA = 10 ATP/ acetyl-CoA (2× everything per glucose). TCA cycle reactions occur in the mitochondria. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex requires the same cofactors as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, lipoic acid). Citrate is Krebs’ starting substrate for making oxaloacetate.

Electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation

NADH electrons are transferred to complex I. FADH2 electrons are transferred to complex II (at a lower energy level than NADH).

The passage of electrons results in the formation of a proton gradient that, coupled to oxidative phosphorylation, drives ATP production. ATP hydrolysis can be coupled to energetically unfavorable reactions.

Uncoupling proteins (found in brown fat, which has more mitochondria than white fat) produce heat by inner mitochondrial membrane permeability proton gradient. ATP synthesis stops, but electron transport continues.

1 NADH 2.5 ATP; 1 FADH2 1.5 ATP NADH electrons from glycolysis enter mitochondria via the malate-aspartate or glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle. Aerobic metabolism of one glucose molecule produces 32 net ATP via malate-aspartate shuttle (heart and liver), 30 net ATP via glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (muscle). Anaerobic glycolysis produces only 2 net ATP per glucose molecule. Aspirin overdose can also cause uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation resulting in hyperthermia.

Odd-chain fatty acids yield 1 propionyl-CoA during metabolism, which can enter the TCA cycle (as succinyl-CoA), undergo gluconeogenesis, and serve as a glucose source (It’s odd for fatty acids to make glucose). Even-chain fatty acids cannot produce new glucose, since they yield only acetyl- CoA equivalents.

Pentose phosphate pathway Also called HMP shunt. Provides a source of NADPH from abundantly available glucose-6-P (NADPH is required for reductive reactions, eg, glutathione reduction inside RBCs, fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis). Additionally, this pathway yields ribose for nucleotide synthesis. Two distinct phases (oxidative and nonoxidative), both of which occur in the cytoplasm. No ATP is used or produced.

Sites: lactating mammary glands, liver, adrenal cortex (sites of fatty acid or steroid synthesis), RBCs.

reduced, which in turn detoxifies free radicals and peroxides. NADPH in RBCs leads to hemolytic anemia due to poor RBC defense against oxidizing agents (eg, fava beans, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, primaquine). Infection (most common cause) can also precipitate hemolysis; inflammatory response produces free radicals that diffuse into RBCs, causing oxidative damage.

X-linked recessive disorder; most common human enzyme deficiency; more prevalent among descendants of populations in malaria- endemic regions (eg, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia).

Sorbitol An alternative method of trapping glucose in the cell is to convert it to its alcohol counterpart, sorbitol, via aldose reductase. Some tissues then convert sorbitol to fructose using sorbitol dehydrogenase; tissues with an insufficient amount/activity of this enzyme are at risk of intracellular sorbitol accumulation, causing osmotic damage (eg, cataracts, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy seen with chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes).

High blood levels of galactose also result in conversion to the osmotically active galactitol via aldose reductase.

Liver, ovaries, and seminal vesicles have both enzymes (they lose sorbitol).

Hepatocytes Glycogen is stored and undergoes glycogenolysis to maintain blood sugar at appropriate levels. liberates glucose-1-phosphate residues off branched glycogen until 4 Glycogen phosphorylase glucose units remain on a branch. Then 4-α-d-glucanotransferase (debranching enzyme ) moves 3 of the 4 glucose units from the branch to the linear linkage. Then α-1,6-glucosidase (debranching enzyme ) cleaves off the last residue, liberating a free glucose.

Systemic 1° carnitine deficiency—no cellular uptake of carnitine no transport of LCFAs into mitochondria toxic accumulation of LCFAs in the cytosol. Causes weakness, hypotonia, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, dilated cardiomyopathy.

Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency— ability to break down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA accumulation of fatty acyl carnitines in the blood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Causes vomiting, lethargy, seizures, coma, liver dysfunction, hyperammonemia. Can lead to sudden death in infants or children. Treat by avoiding fasting.

In the liver, fatty acids and amino acids are metabolized to acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (to be used in muscle and brain).
======================================
In prolonged starvation and diabetic

ketoacidosis, oxaloacetate is depleted for gluconeogenesis. With chronic alcohol overuse, high NADH state leads to accumulation of oxaloacetate (downregulated TCA cycle), shunting it to malate.

Ketone bodies: acetone, (ketone) acetoacetate (ketoacid), β-hydroxybutyrate (ketoacid). Breath smells like acetone (fruity odor). Urine test for ketones can detect acetoacetate, but not β-hydroxybutyrate. RBCs cannot utilize ketone bodies; they strictly use glucose.

Lipoprotein functions Lipoproteins are composed of varying proportions of proteins, cholesterol, TGs, and phospholipids. LDL and HDL carry the most cholesterol.

Cholesterol is needed to maintain cell membrane integrity and synthesize bile acids, steroids, and

vitamin D.

Chylomicron

Delivers dietary TGs to peripheral tissues. Delivers cholesterol to liver in the form of chylomicron

remnants, which are mostly depleted of their TGs. Secreted by intestinal epithelial cells.

VLDL Delivers hepatic TGs to peripheral tissue. Secreted by liver.

IDL

Delivers TGs and cholesterol to liver. Formed from degradation of VLDL.

LDL

Delivers hepatic cholesterol to peripheral tissues. Formed by hepatic lipase modification of IDL in the liver and peripheral tissue. Taken up by target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. LDL is Lethal.

HDL Mediates reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to liver. Acts as a repository for apoC and apoE (which are needed for chylomicron and VLDL metabolism). Secreted from both liver and intestine. Alcohol synthesis. HDL is Healthy.

Abetalipoproteinemia

Autosomal recessive. Mutation in gene that encodes microsomal transfer protein (MTP).

Chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL absent. Deficiency in apo B48– and apo B100–containing lipoproteins. Affected infants present with severe fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, failure to thrive. Later manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa, spinocerebellar degeneration due to vitamin E deficiency, progressive ataxia, acanthocytosis. Intestinal biopsy shows lipid-laden enterocytes (arrow in A ).

Functions of natural killer cells

Lymphocyte member of innate immune system. Use perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis of virally infected cells and tumor cells. Activity enhanced by IL-2, IL-12, IFN-α, and IFN-β. Induced to kill when exposed to a nonspecific activation signal on target cell and/or to an absence

of an inhibitory signal such as MHC I on target cell surface.

Also kills via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CD16 binds Fc region of bound IgG, activating the NK cell).

Tissue-restricted self-antigens are expressed in the thymus due to the action of autoimmune regulator (AIRE); deficiency leads to autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome-1 (Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, Hypoparathyroidism, Adrenal insufficiency, Recurrent Candida infections). “Without AIRE, your body will CHAR”.

Macrophage- lymphocyte interaction

Th1 cells secrete IFN-γ, which enhances the ability of monocytes and macrophages to kill

microbes they ingest. This function is also enhanced by interaction of T cell CD40L with CD40 on macrophages. Macrophages also activate lymphocytes via antigen presentation.

Cytotoxic T cells

Kill virus-infected, neoplastic, and donor graft cells by inducing apoptosis. Release cytotoxic granules containing preformed proteins (eg, perforin, granzyme B). Cytotoxic T cells have CD8, which binds to MHC I on virus-infected cells.

Affinity refers to the individual antibody-antigen interaction, while avidity describes the cumulative

binding strength of all antibody-antigen interactions in a multivalent molecule.

Main antibody in 2° response to an antigen. Most abundant isotype in serum. Fixes complement, opsonizes bacteria, neutralizes bacterial toxins and viruses. Only isotype that crosses the placenta (provides infants with passive immunity that starts to wane after birth). “IgG Greets the Growing fetus.” Associated with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (“warm weather is Great!”).

IgE IgE IgE IgE

Binds mast cells and basophils; cross-links when exposed to allergen, mediating immediate (type I) hypersensitivity through release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. Contributes to immunity to parasites by activating Eosinophils.

Antigen type and memory

Thymus-independent antigens Antigens lacking a peptide component (eg, lipopolysaccharides from gram ⊝ bacteria); cannot be presented by MHC to T cells. Weakly immunogenic; vaccines often require boosters and adjuvants (eg, capsular polysaccharide subunit of Streptococcus pneumoniae PPSV23 vaccine).

Thymus-dependent antigens Antigens containing a protein component (eg, diphtheria toxoid). Class switching and immunologic memory occur as a result of direct contact of B cells with Th cells.

Phagocytes of patients with CGD can utilize H2O2 generated by invading organisms and convert it to ROS. Patients are at risk for infection by catalase ⊕ species (eg, S aureus, Aspergillus) capable of neutralizing their own H2O2, leaving phagocytes without ROS for fighting infections.

Pyocyanin of P aeruginosa generates ROS to kill competing pathogens. Oxidative burst leads to release of lysosomal enzymes.

Interferons

infected with a virus synthesize these glycoproteins, which act on local cells, priming them for viral defense by downregulating protein synthesis to resist potential viral replication and by upregulating MHC expression to facilitate recognition of infected cells. Also play a major role in activating antitumor immunity.

Hypersensitivity types Four types (ABCD): Anaphylactic and Atopic (type I), AntiBody-mediated (type II), Immune Complex (type III), Delayed (cell-mediated, type IV). Types I, II, and III are all antibody-mediated.

Type I hypersensitivity

Allergen  Allergen- speciﬁc IgE  Fc receptor for IgE  Degranulation 

Anaphylactic and atopic—two phases:

Immediate (minutes): antigen crosslinks

preformed IgE on presensitized mast cells immediate degranulation release of histamine (a vasoactive amine), tryptase (marker of mast cell activation), and leukotrienes.

Late (hours): chemokines (attract inflammatory cells, eg, eosinophils) and other mediators from mast cells inflammation and tissue damage.

First (type) and Fast (anaphylaxis). Test: skin test or blood test (ELISA) for allergen- specific IgE.

Example:

Anaphylaxis (eg, food, drug, or bee sting allergies)

Allergic asthma

Type II hypersensitivity

NK cell  Fc receptor for IgG  Surface antigen  Abnormal cell  Antibody-dependent  cellular cytotoxicity 

Antibodies bind to cell-surface antigens or extracellular matrix cellular destruction, inflammation, and cellular dysfunction.

Cellular destruction—cell is opsonized (coated)

by antibodies, leading to either: Phagocytosis and/or activation of

complement system.

NK cell killing (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity).

Inflammation—binding of antibodies to cell surfaces activation of complement system and Fc receptor-mediated inflammation.

|

Direct Coombs test—detects antibodies attached directly to the RBC surface. Indirect Coombs test—detects presence of unbound antibodies in the serum.

Examples:

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (including drug-induced form)

Immune thrombocytopenia Transfusion reactions Hemolytic disease of the newborn

Examples:

Goodpasture syndrome Rheumatic fever Hyperacute transplant rejection

Cellular dysfunction—antibodies bind to cell-surface receptors abnormal blockade or activation of downstream process.

Immune complex—antigen-antibody (mostly IgG) complexes activate complement, which attracts neutrophils; neutrophils release lysosomal enzymes.

In type III reaction, imagine an immune complex as 3 things stuck together: antigen- antibody-complement.

Enzymes from neutrophils damage endothelial cells

complex disease. Antibodies to foreign proteins are produced and 1–2 weeks later, antibody- antigen complexes form and deposit in tissues complement activation inflammation and tissue damage ( serum C3, C4).

lymphadenopathy occur 1–2 weeks after antigen exposure. Serum sickness–like reactions are associated with some drugs (may act as haptens, eg, penicillin, monoclonal antibodies) and infections (eg, hepatitis B).

Arthus reaction—a local subacute immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Intradermal injection of antigen into a presensitized (has circulating IgG) individual leads to immune complex formation in the skin (eg, enhanced local reaction to a booster vaccination). Characterized by edema, fibrinoid necrosis, activation of complement.

Microbiology

“That within one linear centimeter of your lower colon there lives and works more bacteria (about 100 billion) than all humans who have ever been born. Yet many people continue to assert that it is we who are in charge of the world.”

—Neil deGrasse Tyson

“What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.”

—Henry S. Haskins

“Wise and humane management of the patient is the best safeguard against infection.”

—Florence Nightingale

“I sing and play the guitar, and I’m a walking, talking bacterial infection.”

—Kurt Cobain

Microbiology questions on the Step 1 exam often require two (or more) steps: Given a certain clinical presentation, you will first need to identify the most likely causative organism, and you will then need to provide an answer regarding some features of that organism or relevant antimicrobial agents. For example, a description of a child with fever and a petechial rash will be followed by a question that reads, “From what site does the responsible organism usually enter the blood?”

This section therefore presents organisms in two major ways: in individual microbial “profiles” and in the context of the systems they infect and the clinical presentations they produce. You should become familiar with both formats. When reviewing the systems approach, remind yourself of the features of each microbe by returning to the individual profiles. Also be sure to memorize the laboratory characteristics that allow you to identify microbes.

Anaerobes Can’t Breathe Fresh Air. Anaerobes are normal microbiota in GI tract, typically pathogenic elsewhere. AminO2glycosides are ineffective against anaerobes because these antibiotics require O2 to enter into bacterial cell.

Anaerobes Examples include Clostridium, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Actinomyces israelii. They lack catalase and/or superoxide dismutase and are thus susceptible to oxidative damage. Generally foul smelling (short-chain fatty acids), are difficult to culture, and produce gas in tissue (CO2 and H2).

Facultative anaerobes May use O2 as a terminal electron acceptor to generate ATP, but can also use fermentation and other O2-independent pathways.

Streptococci, staphylococci, and enteric gram ⊝ bacteria.

Examples: B anthracis (anthrax), B cereus (food poisoning), C botulinum (botulism), C difficile (pseudomembranous colitis), C perfringens (gas gangrene), C tetani (tetanus). Autoclave to kill Bacillus and Clostridium (ABC).

Some gram ⊕ bacteria can form spores when nutrients are limited. Spores lack metabolic activity and are highly resistant to heat and chemicals. Core contains dipicolinic acid (responsible for heat resistance). Must autoclave to kill spores (as is done to surgical equipment) by steaming at 121°C for 15 minutes. Hydrogen peroxide and iodine-based agents are also sporicidal.

Bacterial virulence factors

These promote evasion of host immune response.

Capsular polysaccharide

Highly charged, hydrophilic structure. Acts as barrier to phagocytosis and complement-mediated

lysis. Major determinant of virulence.

Protein A

Binds Fc region of IgG. Prevents opsonization and phagocytosis. Expressed by S aureus.

IgA protease

Enzyme that cleaves IgA, allowing bacteria to adhere to and colonize mucous membranes. Secreted

by S pneumoniae, H influenzae type b, and Neisseria (SHiN).

M protein Helps prevent phagocytosis. Expressed by group A streptococci. Sequence homology with human cardiac myosin (molecular mimicry); possibly underlies the autoimmune response seen in acute rheumatic fever.

Transformation

Competent bacteria can bind and import short

pieces of environmental naked bacterial chromosomal DNA (from bacterial cell lysis). The transfer and expression of newly transferred genes is called transformation. A feature of many bacteria, especially S pneumoniae, H influenzae type b, and Neisseria (SHiN).

Degraded  uncombined DNA  Recipient DNA Donor DNA  Naked DNA  Recipient cell  Transformed cell 

Adding deoxyribonuclease degrades naked

======================================
Conjugation F+ × F–

F+ plasmid contains genes required for sex pilus and conjugation. Bacteria without this plasmid are termed F–. Sex pilus on F+ bacterium contacts F− bacterium. A single strand of plasmid DNA is transferred across the conjugal bridge (“mating bridge”). No transfer of chromosomal DNA.

Hfr × F– F+ plasmid can become incorporated into bacterial chromosomal DNA, termed high- frequency recombination (Hfr) cell. Transfer of leading part of plasmid and a few flanking chromosomal genes. High-frequency recombination may integrate some of those bacterial genes. Recipient cell remains F– but now may have new bacterial genes.

streptococci.

ββ-hemolytic bacteria

Complete lysis of RBCs pale/clear area surrounding colony on blood agar A .

Include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus

pyogenes (group A strep), Streptococcus agalactiae (group B strep), Listeria monocytogenes.

Gram ⊕, β-hemolytic, catalase ⊕, coagulase ⊕ cocci in clusters A . Protein A (virulence factor) binds Fc-IgG, inhibiting complement activation and phagocytosis. Commonly colonizes the nares, ears, axilla, and groin.

Staphylococcus aureus

TSST-1 is a superantigen that binds to MHC II and T-cell receptor, resulting in polyclonal T-cell activation and cytokine release. Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS)— fever, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, desquamation, shock, end-organ failure. TSS results in AST, ALT, bilirubin. Associated with prolonged use of vaginal tampons or nasal packing. Compare with Streptococcus pyogenes TSS (a toxic shock–like syndrome associated with painful skin infection).

Inflammatory disease—skin infections, organ abscesses, pneumonia (often after influenza virus infection), infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis.

Toxin-mediated disease—toxic shock syndrome (TSST-1), scalded skin syndrome (exfoliative toxin), rapid-onset food poisoning (enterotoxins).

S aureus food poisoning due to ingestion of preformed toxin short incubation period (2–6 hr) followed by nonbloody diarrhea and emesis. Enterotoxin is heat stable not destroyed by cooking.

MRSA (methicillin-resistant S aureus)— important cause of serious healthcare- associated and community-acquired infections. Resistance due to altered penicillin- binding proteins (conferred by mecA gene). Some strains release Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which kills leukocytes and causes tissue necrosis.

S aureus makes coagulase and toxins. Forms fibrin clot around itself abscess.

Staphylococcus epidermidis

Staphylococcus saprophyticus

Gram ⊕, catalase ⊕, coagulase ⊝, urease ⊕ cocci in clusters. Novobiocin resistant. Normal microbiota of female genital tract and perineum. Second most common cause of uncomplicated UTI in young females (most common is E coli).

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Gram ⊕, α-hemolytic, lancet-shaped

diplococci A . Encapsulated. IgA protease. Optochin sensitive and bile soluble. Most commonly causes MOPS:

A  Viridans group  streptococci 

Meningitis Otitis media (in children) Pneumonia Sinusitis

Gram ⊕, α-hemolytic cocci. Optochin resistant and bile insoluble. Normal microbiota of the oropharynx.

Pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with “rusty” sputum. Patients with anatomic or functional hyposplenia or asplenia are predisposed to infection. No virulence without capsule. Pneumococcal vaccines are available in both conjugate (PCV13, PCV15, PCV20) and polysaccharide (PPSV23) formulations.

Viridans group strep live in the mouth, because they are not afraid of-the-chin (op-to-chin resistant).

Streptococcus mutans and S mitis cause dental caries.

Sanguinis = blood. Think, “there is lots of blood in the heart” (infective endocarditis).

S sanguinis makes dextrans that bind to fibrin- platelet aggregates on damaged heart valves, causing infective endocarditis.

Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci)

Gram ⊕ cocci in chains A . Group A strep

cause: Pyogenic—pharyngitis, cellulitis, impetigo

(“honey-crusted” lesions), erysipelas

Toxigenic—scarlet fever, toxic shock–like

syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis Immunologic—rheumatic fever,

glomerulonephritis

arylamidase (PYR) ⊕. Hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein inhibit phagocytosis. Antibodies to M protein enhance host defenses. Structurally similar to host proteins (ie, myosin); can lead to autoimmunity (ie, carditis seen in acute rheumatic fever).

glomerulonephritis.

Key virulence factors include DNase, erythrogenic exotoxin, streptokinase, streptolysin O. ASO titer or anti-DNase B antibodies indicate recent S pyogenes infection.

Scarlet fever—blanching, sandpaperlike body rash, strawberry tongue, and circumoral pallor in the setting of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (erythrogenic toxin ⊕).

Diagnose strep pharyngitis via throat swab, which can be tested with an antigen detection assay (rapid, in-office results) or cultured on blood agar (results in 48 hours).

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci)

Group B for Babies!

Gram ⊕ cocci, bacitracin resistant, β-hemolytic, colonizes vagina; causes pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, mainly in babies. Polysaccharide capsule confers virulence. Produces CAMP factor, which enlarges the area of hemolysis formed by S aureus. (Note: CAMP stands for the authors of the test, not cyclic AMP.) Hippurate test ⊕. PYR ⊝. Screen pregnant patients at 35–37 weeks of gestation with rectal and vaginal swabs. Patients with ⊕ culture receive intrapartum penicillin/ampicillin prophylaxis.

Streptococcus gallolyticus Formerly S bovis. Gram ⊕ cocci, colonizes the gut. Can cause bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Patients with S gallolyticus endocarditis have incidence of colon cancer.

Bovis in the blood = cancer in the colon.

Enterococci Gram ⊕ cocci. Enterococci (E faecalis and E faecium) are normal colonic microbiota that are penicillin G resistant and cause UTI, biliary tract infections, and infective endocarditis (following GI/GU procedures). Catalase ⊝, PYR ⊕, typically nonhemolytic. VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are an important cause of healthcare-associated infection.

Enterococci are more resilient than streptococci, can grow in 6.5% NaCl and bile (lab test). Entero = intestine, faecalis = feces, strepto = twisted (chains), coccus = berry.

Gram ⊕, spore-forming rod that produces anthrax toxin, exotoxins consisting of protective antigen, lethal factor (inhibits MAP kinase macrophage apoptosis), and edema factor (acts as adenylyl cyclase intracellular cAMP, upsetting homeostasis edema, necrosis). Has a polypeptide capsule (poly d-glutamate). Colonies show a halo of projections, sometimes called “medusa head” appearance.

Cutaneous anthrax—painless papule surrounded by vesicles ulcer with black eschar A (painless, necrotic) uncommonly progresses to bacteremia and death.

Pulmonary anthrax—inhalation of spores, most commonly from contaminated animals or animal products, although also a potential bioweapon flulike symptoms that rapidly progress to fever, pulmonary hemorrhage, mediastinitis (CXR may show widened mediastinum), and shock. Also called woolsorter’s disease. Prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline when exposed. Both cutaneous and pulmonary anthrax may be complicated by hemorrhagic meningitis.

Bacillus cereus

Gram ⊕ rod. Causes food poisoning. Spores survive cooking rice (reheated rice syndrome). Keeping rice warm results in germination of spores and enterotoxin formation. Emetic type causes nausea and vomiting within 1–5 hours. Caused by cereulide, a preformed toxin. Diarrheal type causes watery, nonbloody diarrhea and GI pain within 8–18 hours. Management: supportive care (antibiotics are ineffective against toxins).

Clostridioides difficile

Produces toxins A and B, which damage enterocytes. Both toxins lead to watery diarrhea pseudomembranous colitis A . Often 2° to antibiotic use, especially clindamycin, ampicillin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones; associated with PPIs. Fulminant infection: toxic megacolon, ileus,

shock.

Difficile causes diarrhea. Diagnosed by PCR or antigen detection of one or both toxins in stool. Treatment: oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. For recurrent cases, consider repeating prior regimen or fecal microbiota transplant.

Clostridia

Gram ⊕, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic rods. Tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin are proteases that cleave SNARE proteins involved in neurotransmission.

Clostridium tetani

Pathogen is noninvasive and remains localized to wound site. Produces tetanospasmin, an exotoxin causing tetanus. Tetanospasmin spreads by retrograde axonal transport to CNS and blocks release of GABA and glycine from Renshaw cells in spinal cord.

Tetanus is tetanic paralysis. Prevent with tetanus vaccine. Treat with antitoxin +/− vaccine booster, antibiotics, diazepam (for muscle spasms), and wound debridement.

Causes spastic paralysis, trismus (lockjaw), risus sardonicus (raised eyebrows and open grin), opisthotonos (spasms of spinal extensors).

Clostridium botulinum Produces a heat-labile toxin that inhibits ACh

release at the neuromuscular junction, causing botulism. In babies, ingestion of spores (eg, in honey) leads to disease (floppy baby syndrome). In adults, disease is caused by ingestion of preformed toxin (eg, in canned food).

Botulinum is from bad bottles of food, juice, and honey.

Treatment: human botulinum immunoglobulin. Local botulinum toxin A (Botox) injections used to treat focal dystonia, hyperhidrosis, muscle spasms, and cosmetic reduction of facial wrinkles.

Symptoms of botulism (the 5 D’s): diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnea, descending flaccid paralysis. Does not present with sensory deficits.

Clostridium  perfringens  A 

Produces α-toxin (lecithinase, a phospholipase) that can cause myonecrosis (gas gangrene A ; presents as soft tissue crepitus) and hemolysis. If heavily spore-contaminated food is cooked but left standing too long at < 60°C, spores germinate vegetative bacteria heat-labile enterotoxin late-onset (10-12 hours) food poisoning symptoms, resolution in 24 hours.

Perfringens perforates a gangrenous leg. Spontaneous gas gangrene (via hematogenous seeding; associated with colonic malignancy) is most commonly caused by Clostridium septicum.

Corynebacterium diphtheriae

Gram ⊕ rods occurring in angular arrangements; transmitted via respiratory droplets. Causes diphtheria via exotoxin encoded by β-prophage. Potent exotoxin inhibits protein synthesis via ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, leading to possible necrosis in pharynx, cardiac, and CNS tissue. Symptoms include pseudomembranous pharyngitis (grayish-white membrane A ) with lymphadenopathy (“bull’s neck” appearance). Toxin dissemination may cause myocarditis, arrhythmias, neuropathies. Lab diagnosis based on gram ⊕ rods with metachromatic (blue and red) granules and ⊕ Elek test for toxin.

Toxoid vaccine prevents diphtheria.

Listeria monocytogenes

Gram ⊕, facultative intracellular rod; acquired by ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products and cold deli meats, transplacental transmission, by vaginal transmission during birth. Grows well at refrigeration temperatures (“cold enrichment”).

Forms “rocket tails” (red in A ) via actin polymerization that allow intracellular movement and cell- to-cell spread across cell membranes, thereby avoiding antibody. Listeriolysin generates pores in phagosomes, allowing its escape into cytoplasm. Characteristic tumbling motility in broth.

Can cause amnionitis, septicemia, and spontaneous abortion in pregnant patients; granulomatosis infantiseptica; meningitis in immunocompromised patients, neonates, and older adults; mild, self- limited gastroenteritis in healthy individuals.

Treatment: ampicillin.

Nocardia vs Actinomyces

Acid-fast rods (pink rods, arrows in A ). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, often resistant to multiple drugs).

M avium–intracellulare (causes disseminated, non-TB disease in AIDS; often resistant to multiple drugs).

M scrofulaceum (cervical lymphadenitis in children).

M marinum (hand infection in aquarium handlers).

TB symptoms include fever, night sweats, weight loss, cough (nonproductive or productive), hemoptysis. Cord factor creates a “serpentine cord” appearance in virulent M tuberculosis strains; activates macrophages (promoting granuloma formation) and induces release of TNF-α. Sulfatides (surface glycolipids) inhibit phagolysosomal fusion.

Haemophilus influenzae

Small gram ⊝ (coccobacillary) rod. Transmitted through respiratory droplets. Nontypeable (unencapsulated) strains are the most common cause of mucosal infections (otitis media, conjunctivitis, bronchitis) as well as invasive infections since the vaccine for capsular type b was introduced. Produces IgA protease. Culture on chocolate agar, which contains factors V (NAD+) and X (hematin) for growth; can also be grown with S aureus, which provides factor V via RBC hemolysis. Haemophilus causes epiglottitis (endoscopic appearance can be “cherry red” in children; “thumb sign” on lateral neck x-ray A ), meningitis, otitis media, and pneumonia.

Vaccine contains type b capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate) conjugated to diphtheria toxoid or other protein. Given between 2 and 18 months of age. Does not cause the flu (influenza virus does). Treatment: amoxicillin +/− clavulanate for mucosal infections; ceftriaxone for meningitis; rifampin prophylaxis for close contacts.

Burkholderia cepacia complex Aerobic, catalase ⊕, gram ⊝ rod. Causes pneumonia in and can be transmitted between patients with cystic fibrosis. Often multidrug resistant. Infection is a relative contraindication to undergoing lung transplant due to its association with poor outcomes.

Vibrio cholerae

Gram ⊝, flagellated, comma shaped A , oxidase ⊕, grows in alkaline media. Endemic to developing countries. Produces profuse rice-water diarrhea via enterotoxin that permanently activates Gs, cAMP. Sensitive to stomach acid (acid labile); requires large inoculum (high ID50) unless host has gastric acidity. Transmitted via ingestion of contaminated water or uncooked food (eg, raw shellfish). Treat promptly with oral rehydration solution.

Vibrio vulnificus—gram ⊝ bacillus, usually found in marine environments. Causes severe wound infections or septicemia due to exposure to contaminated sea water. Presents as cellulitis that can progress to necrotizing fasciitis in high-risk patients, especially those with liver disease (eg, cirrhosis, hemochromatosis). Serious wound infection requires surgical debridement.

Helicobacter pylori

Curved, flagellated (motile), gram ⊝ rod A that is triple ⊕: catalase ⊕, oxidase ⊕, and urease ⊕ (can use urea breath test or fecal antigen test for diagnosis). Urease produces ammonia, creating an alkaline environment, which helps H pylori survive in acidic mucosa. Colonizes mainly antrum of stomach; causes gastritis and peptic ulcers (especially duodenal). Risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and MALT lymphoma.

Most common initial treatment is triple therapy: amoxicillin (metronidazole if penicillin allergy) + clarithromycin + proton pump inhibitor; antibiotics cure Pylori. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy if concerned about macrolide resistance.
======================================
Spirochetes

Includes Leptospira, Treponema, and Borrelia. Only Borrelia can be visualized using aniline dyes (Wright or Giemsa stain) in light microscopy due to size. Treponema is visualized by dark-field microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) microscopy.

Little Twirling Bacteria. Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction—flulike symptoms (fever, chills, headache, myalgia) after antibiotics are started due to host response to sudden release of bacterial antigens. Usually occurs during treatment of spirochetal infections.

Lyme disease

transmitted by the Ixodes deer tick A (also vector for Anaplasma spp. and protozoa Babesia). Natural reservoir is the mouse; deer are essential to tick life cycle but do not harbor Borrelia.

Common in northeastern United States. Stage 1—early localized: erythema migrans (typical “bulls-eye” configuration B is pathognomonic but not always present), flulike symptoms.

Stage 2—early disseminated: secondary lesions, carditis, AV block, facial nerve (Bell) palsy, migratory myalgias/transient arthritis.

Stage 3—late disseminated: encephalopathy, chronic arthritis, peripheral neuropathy.

A Key Lyme pie to the FACE: Facial nerve palsy (typically bilateral) Arthritis Cardiac block Erythema migrans Treatment: doxycycline (1st line); amoxicillin (pregnant patients, children < 8 years old); ceftriaxone if IV therapy required

* Reticulate body replicates in cell by fission; reorganizes into elementary bodies.

reorganizes into elementary bodies. Chlamydia trachomatis causes neonatal and follicular adult conjunctivitis A , nongonococcal urethritis, PID, and reactive arthritis.

Chlamydial cell wall lacks classic peptidoglycan (due to reduced muramic acid), rendering β-lactam antibiotics ineffective. Chlamys = cloak (intracellular). C psittaci—has an avian reservoir (parrots), causes atypical pneumonia. Lab diagnosis: PCR, NAAT. Cytoplasmic inclusions (reticulate bodies) seen on Giemsa or fluorescent antibody–stained smear. Treatment: doxycycline, azithromycin (for pregnant patients). Add ceftriaxone for possible concomitant gonorrhea.

Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydophila psittaci cause atypical pneumonia; transmitted by aerosol.

Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes

Types A, B, and C Chronic infection, cause blindness due to follicular conjunctivitis in resource-limited areas.

ABC = Africa, Blindness, Chronic infection.

Types D–K Urethritis/PID, ectopic pregnancy, neonatal pneumonia (staccato cough) with eosinophilia, neonatal conjunctivitis (1–2 weeks after birth).

D–K = everything else. Neonatal disease can be acquired during vaginal birth if pregnant patient is infected.

Types L1, L2, and L3 Lymphogranuloma venereum—small, painless ulcers on genitals swollen, painful inguinal lymph nodes that ulcerate (buboes). Treat with doxycycline.

Ectoparasites

Sarcoptes scabiei

Mites burrow into stratum corneum and cause scabies—pruritus (worse at night) and serpiginous burrows (lines) often between fingers and toes A .

Common in children, crowded populations (jails, nursing homes); transmission through skin-to-skin contact (most common) or via fomites.

Treatment: permethrin cream, oral ivermectin, washing/drying all clothing/bedding, treat close contacts.

Pediculus humanus and Phthirus pubis

Blood-sucking lice that cause intense pruritus with associated excoriations, commonly on scalp and neck (head lice), waistband and axilla (body lice), or pubic and perianal regions (pubic lice).

Body lice can transmit Rickettsia prowazekii (epidemic typhus), Borrelia recurrentis (relapsing fever), Bartonella quintana (trench fever).

Treatment: pyrethroids, malathion, or ivermectin lotion, and nit B combing. Children with head lice can be treated at home without interrupting school attendance.

dwellings. Painless bites result in a range of skin reactions, typically pruritic, erythematous papules with central hemorrhagic punctum. A clustered or linear pattern of bites seen upon awakening is suggestive. Diagnosis is confirmed by direct identification of bed bugs in patient’s dwelling.

Bed bugs can spread among rooms; cohabitants may exhibit similar symptoms. Infestations can also spread via travelers from infested hotels and the use of unwashed, used bedding. Treatment: bites self resolve within 1 week. Eradication of the infestation is critical.

PicoRNAvirus = small RNA virus. PERCH on a “peak” (pico).

Includes Poliovirus, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, Coxsackievirus, and HAV. RNA is translated into 1 large polypeptide that is cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into functional viral proteins. Poliovirus, echovirus, and coxsackievirus are enteroviruses and can cause aseptic (viral) meningitis.

Picornavirus

A picornavirus. Nonenveloped RNA virus. Cause of common cold; > 100 serologic types. Acid labile—destroyed by stomach acid; therefore, does not infect the GI tract (unlike the other picornaviruses).

Rhinovirus

Rhino has a runny nose.

Rotavirus

Rotavirus = right out the anus. CDC recommends routine vaccination of all infants except those with a history of intussusception (rare adverse effect of rotavirus vaccination) or SCID.

Segmented dsRNA virus (a reovirus) A . Most important global cause of infantile gastroenteritis. Major cause of acute diarrhea in the United States during winter, especially in day care centers, kindergartens. Villous destruction with atrophy leads to absorption of Na+ and loss of K+.

Influenza viruses

viruses with segmented genome. Contain hemagglutinin (binds sialic acid and promotes viral entry) and neuraminidase (promotes progeny virion release) antigens. Patients at risk for fatal bacterial superinfection, most commonly S aureus, S pneumoniae, and H influenzae. Treatment: supportive +/– neuraminidase inhibitor (eg, oseltamivir, zanamivir).

Hemagglutinin: lets the virus in Neuraminidaways: sends the virus away Reformulated vaccine (“the flu shot”) contains viral strains most likely to appear during the flu season, due to the virus’ rapid genetic change. Killed viral vaccine is most frequently used. Live attenuated vaccine contains temperature- sensitive mutant that replicates in the nose but not in the lung; administered intranasally. Sudden shift is more deadly than gradual drift.

LF]

A matonavirus. Causes rubella, formerly called German (3-day) measles. Fever, postauricular and other lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and fine, maculopapular rash that starts on face and spreads centrifugally to involve trunk and extremities A .

Causes mild disease in children but serious congenital disease (a TORCH infection). Congenital rubella findings include classic triad of sensorineural deafness, cataracts, and patent ductus arteriosus. “Blueberry muffin” appearance may be seen due to dermal extramedullary hematopoiesis.

Paramyxoviruses Paramyxoviruses cause disease in children. They include those that cause parainfluenza (croup), mumps, measles, RSV, and human metapneumovirus. All subtypes can cause respiratory tract infection (bronchiolitis, pneumonia) in infants. All contain surface F (fusion) protein, which causes respiratory epithelial cells to fuse and form multinucleated cells. Palivizumab (monoclonal antibody against F protein) prevents pneumonia caused by RSV infection in premature infants.

Rabies virus

(cytoplasmic inclusions B ) commonly found in Purkinje cells of cerebellum and in hippocampal neurons. Rabies has long incubation period (weeks to months) before symptom onset. Postexposure prophylaxis is wound cleaning plus immunization with killed vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin. Example of passive-active immunity.

Travels to the CNS by migrating in a retrograde fashion (via dynein motors) up nerve axons after binding to ACh receptors. Progression of disease: fever, malaise agitation, photophobia, hydrophobia, hypersalivation paralysis, coma death.

A filovirus A . Following an incubation period of up to 21 days, presents with abrupt onset of flulike symptoms, diarrhea/vomiting, high fever, myalgia. Can progress to DIC, diffuse hemorrhage, shock.

Transmission requires direct contact with bodily fluids, fomites (including dead bodies), infected bats or primates (apes/monkeys); high incidence of healthcare-associated infection.

Supportive care, no definitive treatment. Vaccination of contacts, strict isolation of infected individuals, and barrier practices for healthcare workers are key to preventing transmission.

Diagnosed with RT-PCR within 48 hr of symptom onset. High mortality rate.

Microbiology ` microbiology—Virology

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel ⊕ ssRNA coronavirus and the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical course varies from asymptomatic to critical; most infections are mild.

Predominant presenting symptoms can differ by

variant: Common: fever, myalgia, headache, nasal

congestion, sneezing, cough, sore throat, GI symptoms (eg, nausea, diarrhea).

More specific: anosmia (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste).

Pneumonia is the most frequent serious manifestation, but complications can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability ( thromboembolic complications including DVT, PE, stroke), myocardial injury, neurologic sequelae, shock, organ failure, death.

Strongest risk factors for severe illness or death include advanced age and pre-existing medical comorbidities (eg, obesity, hypertension).

Diagnosed by NAAT (most commonly RT-PCR). Tests detecting viral antigen are rapid and more accessible, but typically less sensitive than NAATs; negative results may warrant additional testing if there is a high suspicion of disease.

Spreads through respiratory particles. Host cell entry occurs by attachment of viral spike protein to ACE2 receptor on cell membranes. Anti-spike protein antibodies confer immunity. Vaccination (primary series and booster) induces humoral and cellular immunity, which decreases risk of contracting or transmitting the virus and confers high rates of protection against severe disease and death. Virus-specific options include antivirals (remdesivir, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, molnupiravir), and antibody-based therapies. Therapies directed against the inflammatory response include dexamethasone and immunomodulators (baricitinib, IL-6 pathway inhibitors).

Signs and symptoms of all hepatitis viruses: episodes of fever, jaundice, ALT and AST. Naked viruses (HAV Hepatitis viruses and HEV) lack an envelope and are not destroyed by the gut: the vowels hit your bowels.

HBV DNA polymerase has DNA- and RNA-dependent activities. Upon entry into nucleus, the polymerase completes the partial dsDNA. Host RNA polymerase transcribes mRNA from viral DNA to make viral proteins. The DNA polymerase then reverse transcribes viral RNA to DNA, which is the genome of the progeny virus.

method to detect HIV viremia in antibody- negative patients.

Viral load tests (RT-PCR) are quantitative and determine amount of viral RNA in the plasma. Use to monitor response to treatment and transmissibility.

Western blot tests are no longer recommended by the CDC for confirmatory testing.

HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab testing is not recommended in babies with suspected HIV due to maternally transferred antibody. Use HIV viral load instead.

AIDS diagnosis: ≤ 200 CD4+ cells/mm3 (normal: 500–1500 cells/mm3) or HIV ⊕ with AIDS-defining condition (eg, Pneumocystis pneumonia).

Prions

Prion diseases are caused by the conversion of a normal (predominantly α-helical) protein termed prion protein (PrPc) to a β-pleated form (PrPsc), which is transmissible via CNS-related tissue (iatrogenic CJD) or food contaminated by BSE-infected animal products (variant CJD). PrPsc resists protease degradation and facilitates the conversion of still more PrPc to PrPsc. Resistant to standard sterilizing procedures, including standard autoclaving. Accumulation of PrPsc results in spongiform encephalopathy and dementia, ataxia, startle myoclonus, and death.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—rapidly progressive dementia, typically sporadic (some familial forms).

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy—also called “mad cow disease.”

Kuru—acquired prion disease noted in tribal populations practicing human cannibalism.

Common causes of meningitis
======================================
Give ceftriaxone and vancomycin empirically (add ampicillin if Listeria is suspected). Viral causes of meningitis: enteroviruses (especially coxsackievirus), HSV-2 (HSV-1 = encephalitis), HIV, West Nile virus (also

causes encephalitis), VZV.

In HIV: Cryptococcus spp. Note: Incidence of Group B streptococcal meningitis in neonates has greatly due to screening and antibiotic prophylaxis in pregnancy. Incidence of H influenzae meningitis has greatly due to conjugate H influenzae vaccinations. Today, cases are usually seen in unimmunized children.

Cerebrospinal fluid findings in meningitis
======================================
Infections causing brain abscess

Most commonly viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. If dental infection or extraction precedes abscess, oral anaerobes commonly involved.

Multiple abscesses are usually from bacteremia; single lesions from contiguous sites: otitis media and mastoiditis temporal lobe and cerebellum; sinusitis or dental infection frontal lobe. Toxoplasma reactivation in AIDS.
======================================
Osteomyelitis

Elevated ESR and CRP sensitive but not specific. Radiographs are insensitive early but can be useful in chronic osteomyelitis ( A , left). MRI is best for detecting acute infection and detailing anatomic involvement ( A , right). Biopsy or aspiration with culture necessary to identify organism.

Ascending infection causing inflammation of the female gynecologic tract. PID may include salpingitis, endometritis, hydrosalpinx, and tubo-ovarian abscess.

Signs include cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, purulent cervical discharge A .

Top bugs—Chlamydia trachomatis (subacute, often undiagnosed), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (acute).

Salpingitis is a risk factor for ectopic pregnancy, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and adhesions. Can lead to perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome)—infection and inflammation of liver capsule and “violin string” adhesions of peritoneum to liver B .

C trachomatis—most common bacterial STI in the United States.

E coli (UTI) and S aureus (wound infection) are the two most common causes.

“My business is not prognosis, but diagnosis. I am not engaged in therapeutics, but in pathology.”

The fundamental principles of pathology are key to understanding diseases in all organ systems. Major topics such as inflammation and neoplasia appear frequently in questions across different organ systems, and such topics are definitely high yield. For example, the concepts of cell injury and inflammation are key to understanding the inflammatory response that follows myocardial infarction, a very common subject of board questions. Similarly, a familiarity with the early cellular changes that culminate in the development of neoplasias—for example, esophageal or colon cancer—is critical. Make sure you recognize the major tumor-associated genes and are comfortable with key cancer concepts such as tumor staging and metastasis. Finally, take some time to learn about the major systemic changes that come with aging, and how these physiologic alterations differ from disease states.

in tissue mass due to in size ( cytoskeleton degradation via ubiquitin- proteasome pathway and autophagy; protein synthesis) and/or number of cells (apoptosis). Causes include disuse, denervation, loss of blood supply, loss of hormonal stimulation, poor nutrition.

Metaplasia Reprogramming of stem cells replacement of one cell type by another that can adapt to a new stress. Usually due to exposure to an irritant, such as gastric acid ( Barrett esophagus) or tobacco smoke ( respiratory ciliated columnar epithelium replaced by stratified squamous epithelium). May progress to dysplasia malignant transformation with persistent insult (eg, Barrett esophagus esophageal adenocarcinoma). Metaplasia of connective tissue can also occur (eg, myositis ossificans, the formation of bone within muscle after trauma).

Dysplasia Disordered, precancerous epithelial cell growth; not considered a true adaptive response. Characterized by loss of uniformity of cell size and shape (pleomorphism); loss of tissue orientation; nuclear changes (eg, nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio and clumped chromatin). Mild and moderate dysplasias (ie, do not involve entire thickness of epithelium) may regress with alleviation of inciting cause. Severe dysplasia often becomes irreversible and progresses to carcinoma in situ. Usually preceded by persistent metaplasia or pathologic hyperplasia.

Ischemia

Inadequate blood supply to meet demand. Mechanisms include arterial perfusion (eg, atherosclerosis), venous drainage (eg, testicular torsion, Budd-Chiari syndrome), shock. Regions most vulnerable to hypoxia/ischemia and subsequent infarction:
======================================
Types of infarcts

Red infarct

Pale infarct

aWatershed areas (border zones) receive blood supply from most distal branches of 2 arteries with limited collateral vascularity. These areas are susceptible to ischemia from hypoperfusion. bNeurons most vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic insults include Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and neocortex (layers 3, 5, 6).

Occurs in venous occlusion and tissues with multiple blood supplies (eg, liver, lung A , intestine, testes), and with reperfusion (eg, after angioplasty). Reperfusion injury is due to damage by free radicals.

Occurs in solid organs with a single (end-

arterial) blood supply (eg, heart B , kidney).

Free radical injury Free radicals damage cells via membrane lipid peroxidation, protein modification, DNA breakage. Initiated via radiation exposure (eg, cancer therapy), metabolism of drugs (phase I), redox reactions, nitric oxide (eg, inflammation), transition metals (eg, iron, copper; form free radicals via Fenton reaction), WBC (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) oxidative burst.

Free radicals can be eliminated by scavenging enzymes (eg, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), spontaneous decay, antioxidants (eg, vitamins A, C, E), and certain metal carrier proteins (eg, transferrin, ceruloplasmin).

Examples:

Oxygen toxicity: retinopathy of prematurity (abnormal vascularization), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, reperfusion injury after thrombolytic therapy

Drug/chemical toxicity: acetaminophen overdose (hepatotoxicity), carbon tetrachloride

(converted by cytochrome P-450 into CCl3 free radical fatty liver [cell injury apolipoprotein synthesis fatty change], centrilobular necrosis)

Metal storage diseases: hemochromatosis (iron) and Wilson disease (copper)

Stem cells of rapidly regenerating tissues (eg, skin, bone marrow, GI tract, gonads) are the most susceptible to radiation injury. Radiotherapy damages cancer cells more than healthy cells because cancer cells have dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms in addition to high replicative rates.

Ionizing radiation toxicity

Ionizing radiation causes DNA (eg, double strand breaks) and cellular damage both directly and indirectly through the production of free radicals. Complications usually arise when patient is exposed to significant doses (eg, radiotherapy, nuclear reactor accidents): Localized inflammation and fibrosis Neoplasia (eg, leukemia, thyroid cancer) Acute radiation syndrome—develops after sudden whole-body exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, erythema, cytopenias, headache, altered mental status.

Preparation for pharmacology questions is not as straightforward as in years past. One major recent change is that the USMLE Step 1 has moved away from testing pharmacotherapeutics. That means you will generally not be required to identify medications indicated for a specific condition. You still need to know mechanisms and important adverse effects of key drugs and their major variants. Obscure derivatives are low- yield. Learn their classic and distinguishing toxicities as well as major drug-drug interactions.

Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology concepts can be useful while studying pharmacology. The exam has a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as on NSAIDs, which are covered throughout the text. Specific drug dosages or trade names are generally not testable. The exam may use graphs to test various pharmacology content, so make sure you are comfortable interpreting them.

Volume of distribution (Vd) Theoretical volume occupied by the total amount of drug in the body relative to its plasma concentration. Apparent Vd of plasma protein–bound drugs can be altered by liver and kidney disease ( protein binding, Vd). Drugs may distribute in more than one compartment. Hemodialysis is most effective for drugs with a low Vd.

Half-life (t1/2)

The time required to change the amount of drug in the body by 1⁄2 during elimination. Steady state is a dynamic equilibrium in which drug concentration stays constant (ie, rate of drug elimination = rate of drug administration).

In first-order kinetics, a drug infused at a constant rate takes 4–5 half-lives to reach steady state. It takes 3.3 half-lives to reach 90% of the steady-state level.

Drug metabolism

Geriatric patients lose phase I first. Patients who are slow acetylators have adverse effects from certain drugs because of rate of metabolism (eg, isoniazid).

Drugs can be metabolized by either or both phase 1 and phase 2 reactions. These reactions serve to bioactivate or deactivate substances, and do not have to take place sequentially (eg, phase I can follow phase II, or take place as a single reaction).

Lipophilic drugs  Polar drugs (water-soluble)  Phase II Reactive oxygen metabolites  Phase I (predominantly CYP450-dependent)  Methylation  Acetylation  Sulfation  Glucuronidation  Reduction  Oxidation  Hydrolysis  Slightly polar metabolite (active or inactive) Reactive oxygen metabolites  Very polar, hydrophilic metabolite (except acetylated metabolite)  Excretion Serum (urine, sweat), bile (stool)

(sympathetic nervous system results in a “chold” sweat).

Nicotinic ACh receptors are ligand-gated channels allowing efflux of K+ and influx of Na+ and in some cases Ca2+. Two subtypes: NN (found in autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla) and NM (found in neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle). Acetylcholine receptors

Muscarinic ACh receptors are G-protein–coupled receptors that usually act through 2nd messengers. 5 subtypes: M1–5 found in heart, smooth muscle, brain, exocrine glands, and on sweat glands (cholinergic sympathetic).

Autonomic drugs

Release of norepinephrine from a sympathetic nerve ending is modulated by NE itself, acting on presyn aptic α2-autoreceptors negative feedback.

Amphetamines use the NE transporter (NET) to enter the presynaptic terminal, where they utilize the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) to enter neurosecretory vesicles. This displaces NE from the vesicles. Once NE reaches a concentration threshold within the presynaptic terminal, the action of NET is reversed, and NE is expelled into the synaptic cleft, contributing to the characteristics and effects of NE observed in patients taking amphetamines.

Epinephrine response exhibits reversal of mean arterial pressure from a net increase (the α response) to a net decrease (the β2 response).

Phenylephrine response is suppressed but not reversed because it is a “pure” α-agonist (lacks β-agonist properties).

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors inhibit PDE, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of cAMP and/or cGMP, and thereby increase cAMP and/or cGMP. These inhibitors have varying specificity for PDE isoforms and thus have different clinical uses.
======================================
aCilostazol is a PDE-3 inhibitor, but due to its indications is categorized as a platelet inhibitor together with dipyridamole. bDipyridamole is a nonspecific PDE inhibitor, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation. It also prevents adenosine reuptake by platelets extracellular adenosine vasodilation.

Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics

Aging alters the passage of drugs through the body and standard doses can result in plasma

concentrations. Older patients often require reduced doses to prevent toxicity. Absorption—mostly unaffected. Distribution— total body water ( Vd of hydrophilic drugs concentration), total body fat

( Vd of lipophilic drugs half-life).

Metabolism— hepatic mass and blood flow first-pass metabolism, hepatic clearance.

Phase I of drug metabolism is decreased; phase II is relatively preserved.

Public Health Sciences

“Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.” —Sir William Osler

“Of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhuman.”

—Martin Luther King, Jr.

“People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

—Maya Angelou

“On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.” —Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club

A heterogenous mix of epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, law, healthcare delivery, patient safety, quality improvement, and more falls under the heading of public health sciences. Biostatistics and epidemiology are the foundations of evidence-based medicine and are very high yield. Make sure you can quickly apply biostatistical equations such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in a problem-solving format. Also, know how to set up your own 2 × 2 tables, and beware questions that switch the columns. Quality improvement and patient safety topics were introduced a few years ago on the exam and represent trends in health system science. Medical ethics questions often require application of principles. Typically, you are presented with a patient scenario and then asked how you would respond. In this edition, we provide further details on communication skills and patient care given their growing emphasis on the exam. Effective communication is essential to the physician- patient partnership. Physicians must seek opportunities to connect with patients, understand their perspectives, express empathy, and form shared decisions and realistic goals.

Clinical therapeutic trial Experimental study involving humans. Compares therapeutic benefits of ≥ 2 interventions (eg, treatment vs placebo, treatment vs treatment). Study quality improves when clinical trial is randomized, controlled, and double-blinded (ie, neither subject nor researcher knows whether the subject is in the treatment or control group). Triple-blind refers to additional blinding of the researchers analyzing the data.

Crossover clinical trial—compares the effect of a series of ≥ 2 treatments on a subject. Order in which subjects receive treatments is randomized. Washout period occurs between treatments. Allows subjects to serve as their own controls.

Intention-to-treat analysis—all subjects are analyzed according to their original, randomly assigned treatment. No one is excluded. Attempts to avoid bias from attrition, crossover, and nonrandom noncompliance, but may dilute the true effects of intervention.

As-treated analysis—all subjects are analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. risk of bias.

Per-protocol analysis—subjects who fail to complete treatment as originally, randomly assigned are excluded. risk of bias.

Clinical trials occur after preclinical studies and consist of five phases (“Can I SWIM?”).

FDA approval  Phase 2 Efficacy assessment (does it Work?) Provides additional data on short-term adverse effects.   Phase 1 Safety assessment via dose escalation. Determine maximum tolerable dose.   Preclinical Test drug in lab animals and in vitro experiments  Phase 0 Initial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment via microdosing. Often skipped.   Phase 3 Effectiveness assessment via comparison with current standard of care/placebo (any Improvement?)    Phase 4  Provides data on long-tern or rare adverse effects (can it stay on the Market?)   ?  ?  Postmarketing surveillance of patients with disease of interest. Open label.

======================================
Off-label drug use

Use of a drug to treat a disease in a form, population group, or dosage that is not specifically approved by the FDA. Reasons for off-label use include treatment of an illness with no approved pharmacologic treatment or exploring alternative treatments after failure of approved options. Example: use of tricyclic antidepressants for treating neuropathic/chronic pain.

Confidence interval Range of values within which the true mean of the population is expected to fall, with a specified probability.

CI = 1 – α. The 95% CI (corresponding to α = 0.05) is often used. As sample size increases, CI narrows.

CI for sample mean = x ± Z(SE) For the 95% CI, Z = 1.96. For the 99% CI, Z = 2.58.

H0 is rejected (and results are significant) when:

95% CI for mean difference excludes 0 95% CI OR or RR excludes 1 CIs between two groups do not overlap

H0 is not rejected (and results are not significant)

when: 95% CI for mean difference includes 0 95% CI OR or RR includes 1 CIs between two groups do overlap

Meta-analysis

A method of statistical analysis that pools summary data (eg, means, RRs) from multiple studies for a more precise estimate of the size of an effect. Also estimates heterogeneity of effect sizes between studies.

Improves power, strength of evidence, and generalizability (external validity) of study findings. Limited by quality of individual studies and bias in study selection.

Informed consent

A process (not just a document/signature) that

requires: Disclosure: discussion of pertinent

information, including risks/benefits (using medical interpreter, if needed)

Understanding: ability to comprehend Capacity: ability to reason and make one’s

own decisions (distinct from competence, a legal determination)

Voluntariness: freedom from coercion and manipulation

Patients must have a comprehensive understanding of their diagnosis and the risks/ benefits of proposed treatment and alternative options, including no treatment.

Exceptions to informed consent (WIPE it away): Waiver—patient explicitly relinquishes the

right of informed consent

Legally Incompetent—patient lacks decision- making capacity (obtain consent from legal surrogate)

Therapeutic Privilege—withholding information when disclosure would severely harm the patient or undermine informed decision-making capacity

Emergency situation—implied consent may apply

Patients must be informed of their right to

revoke written consent at any time, even orally.

Consent for minors

A minor is generally any person < 18 years old. Parental consent laws in relation to healthcare vary by state. In general, parental consent should be obtained, but exceptions exist for emergency treatment (eg, blood transfusions) or if minor is legally emancipated (eg, married, self-supporting, or in the military).

_

Situations in which parental consent is usually

not required: Sex (contraception, STIs, prenatal care—

usually not abortion)

—

Drugs (substance use disorder treatment) Rock and roll (emergency/trauma)

Physicians should always encourage healthy minor-guardian communication.

Physician should seek a minor’s assent

(agreement of someone unable to legally consent) even if their consent is not required.

Advance directives Instructions given by a patient in anticipation of the need for a medical decision. Details vary per state law.

Oral advance directive Incapacitated patient’s prior oral statements commonly used as guide. Problems arise from variance in interpretation. If patient was informed, directive was specific, patient made a choice, and decision was repeated over time to multiple people, then the oral directive is more valid.
======================================
Written advance directive

Delineates specific healthcare interventions that patient anticipates accepting or rejecting during

treatment for a critical or life-threatening illness. A living will is an example.

Medical power of attorney

Patient designates an agent to make medical decisions in the event that the patient loses decision- making capacity. Patient may also specify decisions in clinical situations. Can be revoked by patient if decision-making capacity is intact. More flexible than a living will.

Do not resuscitate order

DNR order prohibits cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Patient may still consider other life-

sustaining measures (eg, intubation, feeding tube, chemotherapy).

Ideally, discussions with patients occur before ventilator support is necessary. However, information about patient preferences may be absent at the time patients require this intervention to survive.

Medical decision-making frequently relies on surrogate decision-makers (patient identified or legally appointed) when discussing the continuation or withdrawal of ventilatory support, focusing on both the prognosis of the condition and the believed wishes of the patient.

If surrogates indicate patient would not have wanted to receive life support with ventilation withhold or withdraw life support regardless of what the surrogate prefers.

If the decision is made to withhold or withdraw life support, involve palliative care, chaplain services, and the primary care physician in medical discussions with the family and provide emotional support.

Surrogate decision- maker If a patient loses decision-making capacity and has not prepared an advance directive, individuals (surrogates) who know the patient must determine what the patient would have done. Priority of surrogates: spouse adult children parents adult siblings other relatives (the spouse chips in).

Confidentiality Confidentiality respects patient privacy and autonomy. If the patient is incapacitated or the situation is emergent, disclosing information to family and friends should be guided by professional judgment of patient’s best interest. The patient may voluntarily waive the right to confidentiality (eg, insurance company request). General principles for exceptions to confidentiality:

Potential physical harm to self or others is serious and imminent Alternative means to warn or protect those at risk is not possible Steps can be taken to prevent harm

Examples of exceptions to patient confidentiality (many are state specific) include the following

(“The physician’s good judgment SAVED the day”): Patients with Suicidal/homicidal ideation Abuse (children, older adults, and/or prisoners) Duty to protect—state-specific laws that sometimes allow physician to inform or somehow

protect potential Victim from harm

Patients with Epilepsy and other impaired automobile drivers Reportable Diseases (eg, STIs, hepatitis, food poisoning); physicians may have a duty to warn

public officials, who will then notify people at risk. Dangerous communicable diseases, such as TB or Ebola, may require involuntary treatment.

Accepting gifts from patients A complex subject without definitive regulations. Some argue that the patient-physician relationship is strengthened through accepting a gift from a patient, while others argue that negative consequences outweigh the benefits of accepting any gift.

In practice, patients often present items such as cards, baked goods, and inexpensive gifts to physicians. The physician’s decision to accept or decline is based on an individual assessment of whether or not the risk of harm outweighs the potential benefit.

Physicians should not accept gifts that are inappropriately large or valuable. Gifts should not be accepted if the physician identifies that the gift could detrimentally affect

patient care.

Gifts that may cause emotional or financial stress for the patient should not be accepted. If a gift violates any of the guidelines above, the best practice is to thank the patient for offering a kind gift, but politely indicate that it must be declined. During this conversation it should be emphasized that the incident does not influence the physician-patient relationship in any way.

Patient-centered interviewing techniques

Introduction

Introduce yourself and ask the patient their name and how they would like to be addressed. Address the patient by the name and pronouns given. Avoid making gender assumptions. Sit at eye level near the patient.

Agenda setting

Identify concerns and set goals by developing joint agenda between the physician and the patient.

Reflection

Actively listen and synthesize information offered by the patient, particularly with respect to

primary concern(s).

Validation Legitimize or affirm the patient’s perspectives.

Recapitulation Summarize what the patient has said so far to ensure correct interpretation.

Facilitation Encourage the patient to speak freely without guiding responses or leading questions. Allow the patient to ask questions throughout the encounter.

Gender- and sexuality- inclusive history taking

Avoid making assumptions about sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and

behavior (eg, a patient who identifies as heterosexual may engage in same-sex sexual activity). Use gender-neutral terms (eg, refer to a patient’s “partner” rather than assuming a spouse’s gender). A patient’s sex assigned at birth and gender identity may differ. Consider stating what pronouns you use when you introduce yourself (eg, “I’m Dr. Smith, and I use

she/her pronouns”) and asking patients how they would like to be addressed.

Reassure them about the confidentiality of their appointments and be sensitive to the fact that patients may not be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity to others in their life. Do not bring up gender or sexuality if it is not relevant to the visit (eg, a gender-nonconforming patient seeking care for a hand laceration).

Cultural formulation interview

Identify the problem through the patient’s perspective. Ask the patient to describe the problem in

their own words, or how the patient would describe the problem to their family and friends. Identify cultural perceptions of factors leading to a problem. Ask the patient to explain why they

think they are experiencing their problem.

Identify how the patient’s background influences their problem. Ask the patient about what makes their problem better or worse. Investigate roles of family, community, and spirituality.

Identify how culture may impact current and future interventions. Ask the patient if they have any concerns about the current plan of treatment and if they have any suggestions. If they do not want to follow medical advice, investigate if there is a way to combine their plans with the standard medical regimen.

Identify possible barriers to care based on culture. Ask the patient if there is anything that would prevent them from seeking care in a standard medical institution. Probe for explanations and what may increase the chance of maintaining a good patient-physician relationship.
======================================
Motivational interviewing

Counseling technique to facilitate behavior modification by helping patients resolve ambivalence about change. Useful for many conditions (eg, nicotine dependence, obesity). Helpful when patient has some desire to change, but it does not require that the patient be committed to making the change. May involve asking patients to examine how their behavior interferes with their life or why they might want to change it. Assess barriers (eg, food access, untreated trauma) that may make behavior change difficult.

Assessing a patient’s readiness for change is also important for guiding physician-suggested goals. These goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time bound (SMART).

Trauma-informed care Patients with history of psychological trauma should receive thorough behavioral health screenings. Regularly assess mood, substance use, social supports, and suicide risk.

Focus assessments on trauma-related symptoms that interfere with social and occupational function. Do not probe into details of the incident.

Always be empathetic. Do not ask invasive questions requiring the patient to describe trauma in detail. Ask permission prior to discussion.

Before the physical exam, reassure patients that they may signal to end it immediately if they experience too much physical or emotional discomfort. Offer the presence of additional staff for support. Psychological counseling may be indicated. Follow-up counseling is offered (or advised) as appropriate.

The 4 Rs of trauma-informed care: Realize, Recognize, Respond, Resist retraumatization.

Communicating with patients with disabilities

Patients may identify with person-first (ie, “a person with a disability”) or identity-first (ie, “a disabled person”) language. Ask patients what terms they use.

Under most circumstances, talk directly to the patient. Do not assume that nonverbal patients do

not understand. Accompanying caregivers can add information to any discussion as needed. Ask if assistance is desired rather than assuming the patient cannot do something alone. Most

people, including people with disabilities, value their independence.

For patients with speech difficulties, provide extra time for the interview. If their speech is difficult to understand, consider asking them to write down a few words or ask them to rephrase their sentence. Repeat what they said to ensure you understood it correctly.

For patients with a cognitive impairment, use concrete, specific language. Ask simple, direct questions. Eliminate background noise and distractions. Do not assume the patient can read. Adjust to how the patient understands best (eg, use hand gestures or ask them to demonstrate a task).

Ask patients who are deaf or hard of hearing their preferred mode of communication. Use light touch or waving to get their attention. For patients who prefer to speak and lipread, eliminate background noise, face the patient, and do not change your mode of speaking. Consider using an interpreter when necessary.

As with other parts of a medical history, do not bring up a disability if it is not relevant to a visit (eg, a patient in a wheelchair with an ear infection). Do not skip relevant parts of the physical exam even if the disability makes the exam challenging.

Use of interpreters Visits with a patient who speaks little English should utilize a professionally trained medical interpreter unless the physician is conversationally fluent in the patient’s preferred language. If an interpreter is unavailable in person, interpretation services may be provided by telephone or video call. If the patient prefers to utilize a family member, this should be recorded in the chart.

Do not assume that a patient is a poor English speaker because of name, skin tone, or accent. Ask the patient what language is preferred.

The physician should make eye contact with the patient and speak to them directly, without use of third-person statements such as “tell him.”

Allow extra time for the interview, and ask one question at a time. For in-person spoken language interpretation, the interpreter should ideally be next to or slightly behind the patient. For sign language interpretation, the interpreter should be next to or slightly behind the physician.

In cases of emergency, facilitate communication by any tools available (eg, friends, family, sketches, interpreter apps) even though they do not comprise standard procedure otherwise.

HIGH-YIELD ORGAN SYSTEMS

` APPROACHING THE ORGAN SYSTEMS

In this section, we have divided the High-Yield Facts into the major Organ Systems. Within each Organ System are several subsections, including Embryology, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. As you progress through each Organ System, refer back to information in the previous subsections to organize these basic science subsections into a “vertically integrated” framework for learning. Below is some general advice for studying the organ systems by these subsections.

Embryology

Relevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology tends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to congenital malformations.

Anatomy

Several topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology, and neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do not ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned and what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more steps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section, electron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an understanding of the clinical significance of the structure.

While studying, emphasize clinically relevant material. For example, be familiar with gross anatomy and radiologic anatomy related to specific diseases (eg, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome), traumatic injuries (eg, fractures, sensory and motor nerve deficits), procedures (eg, lumbar puncture), and common surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy). There are also many questions on the exam involving x-rays, CT scans, and neuro MRI scans. Many students suggest browsing through a general radiology atlas, pathology atlas, and histology atlas. Focus on learning basic anatomy at key levels in the body (eg, sagittal brain MRI; axial CT of the midthorax, abdomen, and pelvis). Basic neuroanatomy (especially pathways, blood supply, and functional anatomy), associated neuropathology, and neurophysiology have good yield. Please note that many of the photographic images in this book are for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily reflective of Step 1 emphasis.
======================================
Physiology

The portion of the examination dealing with physiology is broad and concept oriented and thus does not lend itself as well to fact-based review. Diagrams are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number of questions requiring the interpretation of diagrams. Learn to apply basic physiologic relationships in a variety of ways (eg, the Fick equation, clearance equations). You are seldom asked to perform complex calculations. Hormones

are the focus of many questions; learn where and how they are synthesized, their regulatory mechanisms and sites of action.

A large portion of the physiology tested on the USMLE Step 1 is clinically relevant and involves understanding physiologic changes associated with pathologic processes (eg, changes in pulmonary function with COPD). Thus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with common pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys, GI tract) and endocrine glands.

Pathology

Questions dealing with this discipline are difficult to prepare for because of the sheer volume of material involved. Review the basic principles and hallmark characteristics of the key diseases. Given the clinical orientation of Step 1, it is no longer sufficient to know only the “buzzword” associations of certain diseases (eg, café-au-lait macules and neurofibromatosis); you must also recognize the clinical descriptions of these high-yield physical exam findings.

Given the clinical slant of the USMLE Step 1, it is also important to review the classic presenting signs and symptoms of diseases as well as their associated laboratory findings. Delve into the signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology of major diseases that have a high prevalence in the United States (eg, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, infectious disease). Be prepared to think one step beyond the simple diagnosis to treatment or complications.

The examination includes a number of color photomicrographs and photographs of gross specimens that are presented in the setting of a brief clinical history. However, read the question and the choices carefully before looking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the pathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color atlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days before the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests.
======================================
Pharmacology

Preparation for questions on pharmacology is straightforward. Learning all the key drugs and their characteristics (eg, mechanisms, clinical use, and important adverse effects) is high yield. Focus on understanding the prototype drugs in each class. Avoid memorizing obscure derivatives. Learn the “classic” and distinguishing toxicities of the major drugs. Do not bother with drug dosages or brand names. Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology can be useful while studying pharmacology. There is a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as NSAIDs. Much of the material is clinically relevant. Newer drugs on the market are also fair game.

The cardiovascular system is one of the highest yield areas for the boards and, for some students, may be the most challenging. Focusing on understanding the mechanisms instead of memorizing the details can make a big difference. Pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and heart failure, mechanism of action of drugs (particularly, physiology interactions) and their adverse effects, ECGs of heart blocks, the cardiac cycle, and the Starling curve are some of the more high-yield topics. Differentiating between systolic and diastolic dysfunction is also very important. Heart murmurs and maneuvers that affect these murmurs have also been high yield and may be asked in a multimedia format.

Heart sounds: S1—mitral and tricuspid valve closure. Loudest

at mitral area.

S2—aortic and pulmonary valve closure. Loudest at left upper sternal border.

S3—in early diastole during rapid ventricular filling phase. Best heard at apex with patient in left lateral decubitus position. Associated with filling pressures (eg, MR, AR, HF, thyrotoxicosis) and more common in dilated ventricles (but can be normal in children, young adults, athletes, and pregnancy). Turbulence caused by blood from LA mixing with ESV.

S4—in late diastole (“atrial kick”). Turbulence caused by blood entering stiffened LV. Best heard at apex with patient in left lateral decubitus position. High atrial pressure. Associated with ventricular noncompliance (eg, hypertrophy). Considered abnormal if palpable. Common in older adults.

Jugular venous pulse (JVP): a wave—atrial contraction. Prominent in AV

dissociation (cannon a wave), absent in atrial fibrillation.

c wave—RV contraction (closed tricuspid valve bulging into atrium).

x descent—atrial relaxation and downward displacement of closed tricuspid valve during rapid ventricular ejection phase. Reduced or absent in tricuspid regurgitation and right HF because pressure gradients are reduced.

v wave— RA pressure due to volume against closed tricuspid valve.

y descent—RA emptying into RV. Prominent in constrictive pericarditis, absent in cardiac tamponade.

closure (eg, aortic stenosis, left bundle branch block). Normal order of semilunar valve closure is reversed: in paradoxical splitting P2 occurs before A2. On inspiration, P2 closes later and moves closer to A2, “paradoxically” eliminating the split. On expiration, the split can be heard (opposite to physiologic splitting).

Phase 1 = initial repolarization—inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels begin to open.

Phase 2 = plateau (“platwo”)—Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels balances K+ efflux. Ca2+ influx triggers Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and myocyte contraction (excitation-contraction coupling). Phase 3 = rapid repolarization—massive K+ efflux due to opening of voltage-gated slow delayed-rectifier K+ channels and closure of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Occurs in all cardiac myocytes except for those in the SA and AV nodes.

Phase 4 = resting potential—high K+ permeability through K+ channels.

In contrast to skeletal muscle:

Cardiac muscle action potential has a

plateau due to Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. Cardiac muscle contraction requires Ca2+ influx from ECF to induce Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release).

Cardiac myocytes are electrically coupled to each other by gap junctions.

Occurs in the SA and AV nodes. Key differences from the ventricular action potential include: Phase 0 = upstroke—opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Fast voltage-gated Na+ channels are permanently inactivated because of the less negative resting potential of these cells. Results in a slow conduction velocity that is used by the AV node to prolong transmission from the atria to ventricles.

Pacemaker action potential

Phases 1 and 2 are absent. Phase 3 = repolarization—inactivation of the Ca2+ channels and activation of K+ channels K+

Phase 3 = repolarization—inactivation of the Ca** channels and t activation of K* channels > t K* efflux.

efflux.

Phase 4 = slow spontaneous diastolic depolarization due to If (“funny current”). If channels responsible for a slow, mixed Na+ inward/K+ outward current; different from INa in phase 0 of ventricular action potential. Accounts for automaticity of SA and AV nodes. The slope of phase 4 in the SA node determines HR. ACh/adenosine the rate of diastolic depolarization and HR, while catecholamines depolarization and HR. Sympathetic stimulation the chance that If channels are open and thus HR.

AV node bundle of His right and left bundle branches Purkinje fibers ventricles; left bundle branch divides into left anterior and posterior fascicles.

SA node—located in upper part of crista terminalis near SVC opening; “pacemaker” inherent dominance with slow phase of upstroke.

AV node—located in interatrial septum near coronary sinus opening. Blood supply usually from RCA. 100-msec delay allows time for ventricular filling.

Pacemaker rates: SA > AV > bundle of His/ Purkinje/ventricles.

P wave—atrial depolarization. PR interval—time from start of atrial depolarization to start of ventricular depolarization (normally 120-200 msec). QRS complex—ventricular depolarization (normally < 100 msec). QT interval—ventricular depolarization, mechanical contraction of the ventricles, ventricular repolarization. T wave—ventricular repolarization. T-wave inversion may indicate ischemia or recent MI. J point—junction between end of QRS complex and start of ST segment. ST segment—isoelectric, ventricles depolarized. U wave—prominent in hypokalemia (think hyp“U”kalemia), bradycardia.

Released from atrial myocytes in response to blood volume and atrial pressure. Acts via cGMP. Causes vasodilation and Na+ reabsorption at the renal collecting tubule. Dilates afferent renal arterioles and constricts efferent arterioles, promoting diuresis and contributing to “aldosterone escape” mechanism.

Released from ventricular myocytes in response to tension. Similar physiologic action to ANP, with longer half-life. BNP blood test used for diagnosing HF (very good negative predictive value).

Carotid sinus (dilated region superior to bifurcation of carotid arteries) transmits via glossopharyngeal nerve to solitary nucleus of medulla (responds to changes in BP).

Chemoreceptors:

Peripheral—carotid and aortic bodies are stimulated by Pco2, pH of blood, and Po2 (< 60 mm Hg).

interstitial fluid, which in turn are influenced by arterial CO2 as H+ cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Do not directly respond to Po2. Central chemoreceptors become less responsive with chronically Pco2 (eg, COPD) dependence on peripheral chemoreceptors to detect O2 to drive respiration.

Congenital heart diseases

RIGHT-TO-lEFT SHuNTS

Early cyanosis—“blue babies.” Often diagnosed prenatally or become evident immediately after birth. Usually require urgent surgical treatment and/or maintenance of a PDA.

The 5 T’s:

1. Truncus arteriosus (1 vessel) 2. Transposition (2 switched vessels) 3. Tricuspid atresia (3 = Tri) 4. Tetralogy of Fallot (4 = Tetra) 5. TAPVR (5 letters in the name)

Persistent truncus arteriosus

Truncus arteriosus fails to divide into pulmonary trunk and aorta due to failure of aorticopulmonary septum formation; most patients have accompanying VSD.
======================================
D-transposition of great arteries

Aorta leaves RV (anterior) and pulmonary

trunk leaves LV (posterior) separation of systemic and pulmonary circulations A . Not compatible with life unless a shunt is present to allow mixing of blood (eg, VSD, PDA, or patent foramen ovale).

Due to failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to spiral (narrow superior mediastinum causes “egg on a string” appearance on CXR).

Without surgical intervention, most infants die within the first few months of life.

Aorta  Pulmonary artery  Left ventricle  Right ventricle 

Tricuspid atresia

Absence of tricuspid valve, hypoplastic RV; requires both ASD and VSD for viability.

Tetralogy of Fallot

Caused by anterosuperior displacement of the infundibular septum. Most common cause of early childhood cyanosis. Pulmonary infundibular stenosis (most important determinant for prognosis) Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)— boot-shaped heart on CXR B Overriding aorta VSD

Pulmonary stenosis forces right-to-left flow across VSD RVH, “tet spells” (often caused by crying, fever, and exercise due to exacerbation of RV outflow obstruction).

PROVe. Squatting: SVR, right-to-left shunt, improves

cyanosis.

Associated with 22q11 syndromes.

Pulmonary stenosis  Overriding aorta  Right ventricular hypertrophy  Ventricular septal defect 

Total anomalous pulmonary venous return

Pulmonary veins drain into right heart circulation (SVC, coronary sinus, etc); associated with ASD and sometimes PDA to allow for right-to-left shunting to maintain CO.

Ebstein anomaly Displacement of tricuspid valve leaflets downward into RV, artificially “atrializing” the ventricle. Associated with tricuspid regurgitation, accessory conduction pathways, right-sided HF.

Can be caused by lithium exposure in utero.

Congenital heart diseases (continued)

Acyanotic at presentation; cyanosis may occur years later. Frequency: VSD > ASD > PDA.

Right-to-left shunts: early cyanosis. Left-to-right shunts: “later” cyanosis.

lEFT-TO-RIGHT SHuNTS

O2 saturation in RV and pulmonary artery.

Ventricular septal defect

Asymptomatic at birth, may manifest weeks later or remain asymptomatic throughout life. Most smaller defects self-resolve; larger defects, if left surgically untreated, cause pulmonary blood flow and LV overload, which may progress to HF.

O2 saturation in RA, RV, and pulmonary artery. May lead to paradoxical emboli (systemic venous emboli use ASD to bypass lungs and become systemic arterial emboli).

Atrial septal defect

Defect in interatrial septum C ; wide, fixed split S2. Ostium secundum defects most common and usually an isolated finding; ostium primum defects rarer and usually occur with other cardiac anomalies. Symptoms range from none to HF. Distinct from patent foramen ovale, which is due to failed fusion.

Patent ductus arteriosus

In fetal period, shunt is right to left (normal). In neonatal period, pulmonary vascular resistance shunt becomes left to right progressive RVH and/or LVH and HF. Associated with a continuous, “machinelike” murmur. Patency is maintained by PGE synthesis and low O2 tension. Uncorrected PDA D can eventually result in late cyanosis in the lower extremities (differential cyanosis).

PDA is normal in utero and normally closes only after birth.

Coarctation of the aorta

Aortic narrowing A near insertion of ductus arteriosus (“juxtaductal”). Associated with bicuspid aortic valve, other heart defects, and Turner syndrome. Hypertension in upper extremities. Lower extremities are cold with weak, delayed pulses (brachiofemoral delay). With age, intercostal arteries enlarge due to collateral circulation; arteries erode ribs notched appearance on CXR. Complications include HF, risk of cerebral hemorrhage (berry aneurysms), aortic rupture, and possible infective endocarditis.

Persistence of pulmonary vascular resistance after birth. Associated with abnormal development and postpartum adaptation of pulmonary vasculature. Risk factors include aspiration of meconium- stained amniotic fluid and neonatal pneumonia. Leads to right-to-left shunt through foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus. Newborn presents with signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea) and cyanosis. Preductal O2 saturation is often higher than postductal. Equal pulses (no delay).

Hypertension

Hypertension

Persistent systolic BP ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 80 mm Hg.

RISK FACTORS

age, obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity, high-sodium diet, excess alcohol intake, tobacco

smoking, family history; incidence greatest in Black > White > Asian populations.

FEATuRES

90% of hypertension is 1° (essential) and related to CO or TPR. Remaining 10% mostly 2° to renal/renovascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia (characteristic “string of beads” appearance of renal artery A , usually seen in adult females) and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, 1° hyperaldosteronism, or obstructive sleep apnea.

Hypertensive urgency—severe (≥ 180/≥ 120 mm Hg) hypertension without acute end-organ damage. Hypertensive emergency—formerly called malignant hypertension. Severe hypertension with evidence of acute end-organ damage (eg, encephalopathy, stroke, retinal hemorrhages and exudates, papilledema, MI, HF, aortic dissection, kidney injury, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, eclampsia). Arterioles may show fibrinoid necrosis.

PREdISPOSES TO

Angina

Chest pain due to ischemic myocardium 2° to coronary artery narrowing or spasm; no necrosis.

Stable—usually 2° to atherosclerosis (≥ 70% occlusion); exertional chest pain in classic distribution (possibly with ST depression on ECG), resolving with rest or nitroglycerin. Vasospastic (formerly Prinzmetal or variant)—occurs at rest 2° to coronary artery spasm;

transient ST elevation on ECG. Tobacco smoking is a risk factor; hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are not. Triggers include cocaine, alcohol, and triptans. Treat with Ca2+ channel blockers, nitrates, and smoking cessation (if applicable).

Diagnosis of myocardial infarction

In the first 6 hours, ECG is the gold standard. Cardiac troponin I rises after 4 hours (peaks

at 24 hr) and is for 7–10 days; more specific than other protein markers.

CK-MB increases after 6–12 hours (peaks at 16–24 hr) and is predominantly found in myocardium but can also be released from skeletal muscle. Useful in diagnosing reinfarction following acute MI because levels return to normal after 48 hours.

Acute coronary syndrome treatments

Unstable angina/NSTEMI—Anticoagulation (eg, heparin), antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin) + ADP receptor inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel), β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins. Symptom control with nitroglycerin +/– morphine.

STEMI—In addition to above, reperfusion therapy most important (percutaneous coronary intervention preferred over fibrinolysis). If RV affected (eg, RCA occlusion), support venous return/ preload to maintain cardiac output (eg, IV fluids, avoiding nitroglycerin).

Cardiomyopathies

Dilated cardiomyopathy

Most common cardiomyopathy (90% of cases). Often idiopathic or familial (eg, due to mutation of TTN gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin). Other etiologies include drugs (eg, alcohol, cocaine, doxorubicin), infection (eg, coxsackie B virus, Chagas disease), ischemia (eg, CAD), systemic conditions (eg, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, thyrotoxicosis, wet beriberi), peripartum cardiomyopathy.

Leads to systolic dysfunction. Displays eccentric hypertrophy A (sarcomeres added in series). Compare to athlete’s heart, where LV and RV enlargement facilitates SV and CO. Stress cardiomyopathy (also called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome)— ventricular apical ballooning likely due to sympathetic stimulation (eg, stressful situations).

Findings: HF, S3, systolic regurgitant murmur, dilated heart on echocardiogram, balloon appearance of heart on CXR.

Treatment: Na+ restriction, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, β-blockers, sacubitril, diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (eg, spironolactone), ICD, heart transplant.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

(most commonly due to mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, such as myosin binding protein C and β-myosin heavy chain). Causes syncope during exercise and may lead to sudden death (eg, in young athletes) due to ventricular arrhythmia.

Diastolic dysfunction ensues. Displays ventricular concentric hypertrophy (sarcomeres added in parallel) B , often septal predominance. Myofibrillar disarray and fibrosis.

Classified as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy when LV outflow tract is obstructed. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of mitral valve outflow obstruction dyspnea, possible syncope.

Findings: S4, systolic murmur. May see mitral regurgitation due to impaired mitral valve closure. Treatment: cessation of high-intensity athletics, use of β-blocker or nondihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers (eg, verapamil). ICD if high risk. Avoid drugs that decrease preload (eg, diuretics, vasodilators).

Other causes of concentric LV hypertrophy: chronic HTN, Friedreich ataxia.

Postradiation fibrosis, Löffler endocarditis, Endocardial fibroelastosis (thick fibroelastic tissue in endocardium of young children), Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Hemochromatosis (PLEASe Help!).

Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy

Diastolic dysfunction ensues. Can have low- voltage ECG despite thick myocardium (especially in amyloidosis).

Löffler endocarditis—associated with hypereosinophilic syndrome; histology shows eosinophilic infiltrates in myocardium.

Heart failure

Clinical syndrome of cardiac pump dysfunction congestion and low perfusion. Symptoms include dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue; signs include S3 heart sound, rales, jugular venous distention (JVD), pitting edema A .

Systolic dysfunction—heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), EDV; contractility often 2° to ischemia/MI or dilated cardiomyopathy.

Diastolic dysfunction—heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), normal EDV; compliance ( EDP) often 2° to myocardial hypertrophy.

Right HF most often results from left HF. Cor pulmonale refers to isolated right HF due to pulmonary cause.

ACE inhibitors, ARBs, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, β-blockers (except in acute decompensated HF), and aldosterone receptor antagonists mortality in HFrEF. Loop and thiazide diuretics are used mainly for symptomatic relief. Hydralazine with nitrate therapy improves both symptoms and mortality in select patients.

Left heart failure

Orthopnea

Shortness of breath when supine: venous return from redistribution of blood (immediate gravity

effect) exacerbates pulmonary vascular congestion.

J♥NES (major criteria):

Rheumatic fever

A consequence of pharyngeal infection with group A β-hemolytic streptococci. Late sequelae include rheumatic heart disease, which affects heart valves—mitral > aortic >> tricuspid (high-pressure valves affected most). Early valvular regurgitation, late valvular stenosis.

Joint (migratory polyarthritis) ♥ (carditis) Nodules in skin (subcutaneous) Erythema marginatum (evanescent rash with ring margin) Sydenham chorea (involuntary irregular movements of limbs and face)

Associated with Aschoff bodies (granuloma with giant cells, Anitschkow cells (enlarged macrophages with ovoid, wavy, rodlike nucleus), anti-streptolysin O (ASO) and anti-DNase B titers.

Immune mediated (type II hypersensitivity); not a direct effect of bacteria. Antibodies to M protein cross-react with self antigens, often myosin (molecular mimicry). Treatment/prophylaxis: penicillin.
======================================
Syphilitic heart disease

3° syphilis disrupts the vasa vasorum of the aorta with consequent atrophy of vessel wall and dilation of aorta and valve ring.

Can result in aneurysm of ascending aorta or aortic arch, aortic insufficiency.

May see calcification of aortic root, ascending aortic arch, and thoracic aorta. Leads to “tree bark” appearance of aorta.

Acute pericarditis

Inflammation of the pericardium (red arrows in A ). Commonly presents with sharp pain, aggravated by inspiration, and relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Often complicated by pericardial effusion (between yellow arrows in A ). Presents with friction rub. ECG changes include widespread/diffuse ST-segment elevation and/or PR depression.

Usually idiopathic, but may be due to viral infections (eg, coxsackievirus B), malignancy (metastasis), cardiac surgery, thoracic radiotherapy (early), MI (eg, postcardiac injury syndrome), autoimmune diseases (eg, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis), renal failure (uremia). Treatment: NSAIDs, colchicine, glucocorticoids, dialysis (uremia).

Constrictive pericarditis

Chronic inflammation of pericardium pericardial fibrosis +/– calcification limited space for expansion ventricular filling. Usually idiopathic, but may be due to viral infections, cardiac surgery, thoracic radiotherapy (late). TB is the most common cause in resource-limited countries. EDV CO venous return. Presents with dyspnea, peripheral edema, jugular venous distention, Kussmaul sign, pulsus paradoxus, pericardial knock.

Paradoxical in JVP on inspiration (normally, inspiration negative intrathoracic pressure venous return JVP).

Impaired RV filling RV cannot accommodate venous return during inspiration blood backs up into vena cava Kussmaul sign. May be seen with constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, right HF, massive pulmonary embolism, right atrial or ventricular tumors.

Inflammation of myocardium. Major cause of SCD in adults < 40 years old. Presentation highly variable, can include dyspnea, chest pain, fever, arrhythmias (persistent

tachycardia out of proportion to fever is characteristic).
======================================
Multiple causes:

Viral (eg, adenovirus, coxsackie B, parvovirus B19, HIV, HHV-6, COVID-19); lymphocytic infiltrate with focal necrosis highly indicative of viral myocarditis

Parasitic (eg, Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii) Bacterial (eg, Borrelia burgdorferi, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae) Toxins (eg, carbon monoxide, black widow venom) Rheumatic fever Drugs (eg, doxorubicin, cocaine) Autoimmune (eg, Kawasaki disease, sarcoidosis, SLE, polymyositis/dermatomyositis)

Complications include sudden death, arrhythmias, heart block, dilated cardiomyopathy, HF, mural thrombus with systemic emboli.

Also called Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Autosomal dominant disorder of blood vessels. Findings: blanching lesions (telangiectasias) on skin and mucous membranes, recurrent epistaxis, AVMs (eg, brain, lung, liver), GI bleeding, hematuria.

Arteriovenous malformation—abnormal, high-flow connection between artery and vein.

Most common cardiac tumor is a metastasis (eg, melanoma).

Most common 1° cardiac tumor in adults (arrows in A ). 90% occur in the atria (mostly left

atrium). Myxomas are usually described as a “ball valve” obstruction in the left atrium (associated with multiple syncopal episodes). IL-6 production by tumor constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss). May auscultate early diastolic “tumor plop” sound (mimics mitral stenosis). Histology: gelatinous material, myxoma cells immersed in glycosaminoglycans.

Adults make 6 myxed drinks.

Most frequent 1° cardiac tumor in children (associated with tuberous sclerosis). Histology: hamartomatous growths. More common in the ventricles.

The endocrine system comprises widely distributed organs that work in a highly integrated manner to orchestrate a state of hormonal equilibrium within the body. Generally speaking, endocrine diseases can be classified either as diseases of underproduction or overproduction, or as conditions involving the development of mass lesions—which themselves may be associated with underproduction or overproduction of hormones. Therefore, study the endocrine system first by learning the glands, their hormones, and their regulation, and then by integrating disease manifestations with diagnosis and management. Take time to learn the multisystem connections.

Thyroid development

—

Thyroid diverticulum arises from floor of primitive pharynx and descends into neck. Connected to tongue by thyroglossal duct, which normally disappears but may persist as cysts or the pyramidal lobe of thyroid. Foramen cecum is normal remnant of thyroglossal duct.

Most common ectopic thyroid tissue site is the tongue (lingual thyroid). Removal may result in hypothyroidism if it is the only thyroid tissue present.

Thyroglossal duct cyst A presents as an anterior midline neck mass that moves with swallowing or protrusion of the tongue (vs persistent cervical sinus leading to pharyngeal cleft cyst in lateral neck).

Thyroid follicular cells derived from endoderm. Parafollicular cells arise from 4th pharyngeal pouch.

Structurally homologous to growth hormone. Excessive amounts of prolactin associated with libido.

Prolactin secretion from anterior pituitary is tonically inhibited by dopamine from tuberoinfundibular pathway of hypothalamus. Prolactin in turn inhibits its own secretion by dopamine synthesis and secretion from hypothalamus. TRH prolactin secretion (eg, in 1° or 2° hypothyroidism).

Thyroid hormones Thyroid produces triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), iodine-containing hormones that control the body’s metabolic rate.

Follicles of thyroid. 5′-deiodinase converts T4 (the major thyroid product) to T3 in peripheral tissue (5, 4, 3). Peripheral conversion is inhibited by glucocorticoids, β-blockers, and propylthiouracil (PTU). Reverse T3 (rT3) is a metabolically inactive byproduct of the peripheral conversion of T4 and its production is increased by growth hormone and glucocorticoids. Functions of thyroid peroxidase include oxidation, organification of iodine, and coupling of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Inhibited by PTU and methimazole. DIT + DIT = T4. DIT + MIT = T3. Wolff-Chaikoff effect—protective autoregulation; sudden exposure to excess iodine temporarily turns off thyroid peroxidase T3/T4 production. soUrce

Thyroid cancer Typically diagnosed with fine needle aspiration; treated with thyroidectomy. Complications of surgery include hypocalcemia (due to removal of parathyroid glands), transection of recurrent laryngeal nerve during ligation of inferior thyroid artery (leads to dysphagia and dysphonia [hoarseness]), and injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during ligation of superior thyroid vascular pedicle (may lead to loss of tenor usually noticeable in professional voice users).

Papillary carcinoma

Most common. Empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing (“Orphan Annie” eyes) A ,

psamMoma bodies, nuclear grooves (Papi and Moma adopted Orphan Annie). risk with RET/ PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations, childhood irradiation.

Papillary carcinoma: most prevalent, palpable lymph nodes. Good prognosis.

Follicular carcinoma Good prognosis. Invades thyroid capsule and vasculature (unlike follicular adenoma), uniform follicles; hematogenous spread is common. Associated with RAS mutation and PAX8-PPAR-γ translocations. Fine needle aspiration cytology may not be able to distinguish between follicular adenoma and carcinoma.

Medullary carcinoma

From parafollicular “C cells”; produces calcitonin, sheets of polygonal cells in an amyloid stroma

B (stains with Congo red). Associated with MEN 2A and 2B (RET mutations).

Undifferentiated/ anaplastic carcinoma

Older patients; presents with rapidly enlarging neck mass compressive symptoms (eg, dyspnea,

dysphagia, hoarseness); very poor prognosis. Associated with TP53 mutation.

Hyperaldosteronism Increased secretion of aldosterone from adrenal gland. Clinical features include hypertension, or normal K+, metabolic alkalosis. 1° hyperaldosteronism does not directly cause edema due to aldosterone escape mechanism.

Pancreatic islet cell tumors
======================================
Carcinoid tumors

Carcinoid tumors arise from neuroendocrine cells, most commonly in the intestine or lung. Neuroendocrine cells secrete 5-HT, which undergoes hepatic first-pass metabolism and enzymatic breakdown by MAO in the lung. If 5-HT reaches the systemic circulation (eg, after liver metastasis), carcinoid tumor may present with carcinoid syndrome—episodic flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, right-sided valvular heart disease (eg, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonic stenosis), niacin deficiency (pellagra), urinary 5-HIAA. Histology: rosettes A , chromogranin A ⊕, synaptophysin ⊕. Treatment: surgical resection, somatostatin analog (eg, octreotide) or tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor (eg, telotristat) for symptom control. Rule of thirds: 1/3 metastasize 1/3 present with 2nd malignancy 1/3 are multiple

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

Gastrin-secreting tumor (gastrinoma) of duodenum or pancreas. Acid hypersecretion causes recurrent ulcers in duodenum and jejunum. Presents with abdominal pain (peptic ulcer disease, distal ulcers), diarrhea (malabsorption). Positive secretin stimulation test: gastrin levels after administration of secretin, which normally inhibits gastrin release. May be associated with MEN1.

Diabetes mellitus therapy

All patients with diabetes mellitus should receive education on diet, exercise, blood glucose

monitoring, and complication management. Treatment differs based on the type of diabetes and glycemic control: Type 1 DM—insulin replacement Type 2 DM—oral agents (metformin is first line), non-insulin injectables, insulin replacement;

weight loss particularly helpful in lowering blood glucose

Gestational DM—insulin replacement if nutrition therapy and exercise alone fail Regular (short-acting) insulin is preferred for DKA (IV), hyperkalemia (+ glucose), stress

hyperglycemia.

When studying the gastrointestinal system, be sure to understand the normal embryology, anatomy, and physiology and how the system is affected by various pathologies. Study not only disease pathophysiology, but also its specific findings, so that you can differentiate between two similar diseases. For example, what specifically makes ulcerative colitis different from Crohn disease? Also, be comfortable with basic interpretation of abdominal x-rays, CT scans, and endoscopic images.

Tracheoesophageal anomalies

Esophageal atresia (EA) with distal tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is the most common (85%) and often presents as polyhydramnios in utero (due to inability of fetus to swallow amniotic fluid). Neonates drool, choke, and vomit with first feeding. TEFs allow air to enter stomach (visible on CXR). Cyanosis is 2° to laryngospasm (to avoid reflux-related aspiration). Clinical test: failure to pass nasogastric tube into stomach.

In H-type, the fistula resembles the letter H. In pure EA, CXR shows gasless abdomen.

======================================
Esophageal atresia

Intestinal atresia

Presents with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension within first 1–2 days of life. Duodenal atresia—failure to recanalize. X-ray A shows “double bubble” (dilated stomach, proximal duodenum). Associated with Down syndrome.

Jejunal and ileal atresia—disruption of mesenteric vessels (typically SMA) ischemic necrosis of fetal intestine segmental resorption: bowel becomes discontinuous. X-ray may show “triple bubble” (dilated stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum) and gasless colon. Associated with cystic fibrosis and gastroschisis. May be caused by tobacco smoking or use of vasoconstrictive drugs (eg, cocaine) during pregnancy.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis

Narrow pyloric channel  Thickened and lengthened pylorus 

Most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants. Palpable olive-shaped mass (due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of pyloric sphincter muscle) in epigastric region, visible peristaltic waves, and nonbilious projectile vomiting at ∼ 2–6 weeks old. More common in firstborn males; associated with exposure to macrolides.

Results in hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (2° to vomiting of gastric acid and subsequent volume contraction).

Ultrasound shows thickened and lengthened pylorus. Treatment: surgical incision of pyloric muscles (pyloromyotomy).

Pancreas and spleen embryology

Pancreas—derived from foregut. Ventral pancreatic bud contributes to uncinate process. Both ventral and dorsal buds contribute to pancreatic head and main pancreatic duct.

Annular pancreas—abnormal rotation of ventral pancreatic bud forms a ring of pancreatic tissue encircles 2nd part of duodenum; may cause duodenal narrowing (arrows in A ) and vomiting. Associated with Down syndrome.

Pancreas divisum—ventral and dorsal parts fail to fuse at 7 weeks of development. Common anomaly; mostly asymptomatic, but may cause chronic abdominal pain and/or pancreatitis. Spleen—arises in mesentery of the stomach (dorsal mesogastrium, hence, mesodermal), but has foregut supply (celiac trunk splenic artery).

Hernias

Protrusion of peritoneum through an opening, usually at a site of weakness. Contents may be at risk for incarceration (not reducible back into abdomen/pelvis) and strangulation (ischemia and necrosis). Complicated hernias can present with tenderness, erythema, fever.

Spigelian hernia

Also called spontaneous lateral ventral hernia or hernia of semilunar line. Occurs through defects

between the rectus abdominis and the semilunar line in the Spigelian aponeurosis.

Most occur in the lower abdomen due to lack of the posterior rectus sheath. Presentation is variable but may include abdominal pain and a palpable lump along the Spigelian

fascia.

Diagnosis: ultrasound and CT scan.

Bile

Composed of bile salts (bile acids conjugated to glycine or taurine, making them water soluble), phospholipids, cholesterol, bilirubin, water, and ions. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase catalyzes rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis. Functions:

Digestion and absorption of lipids and fat- soluble vitamins

absorption of enteric bile salts at distal ileum (as in short bowel syndrome, Crohn disease) prevents normal fat absorption and may cause bile acid diarrhea.

Calcium, which normally binds oxalate, binds fat instead, so free oxalate is absorbed by gut frequency of calcium oxalate kidney stones.

Bilirubin and cholesterol excretion (body’s 1° means of elimination)

Antimicrobial activity (via membrane disruption)
======================================
Bilirubin

Heme is metabolized by heme oxygenase to biliverdin (green), which is subsequently reduced to bilirubin (yellow-brown). Unconjugated bilirubin is removed from blood by liver, conjugated with glucuronate, and excreted in bile.

Direct bilirubin: conjugated with glucuronic acid; water soluble (dissolves in water). Indirect bilirubin: unconjugated; water insoluble.

No structural abnormalities. Most common in middle-aged females. Chronic symptoms may be diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or mixed. Pathophysiology is multifaceted. May be associated with fibromyalgia and mood disorders (anxiety, depression). First-line treatment is lifestyle modification and dietary changes.

Appendicitis

Acute inflammation of the appendix (blue arrow in A ), can be due to obstruction by fecalith (in adults) or lymphoid hyperplasia (in children).

Proximal obstruction of appendiceal lumen closed-loop obstruction intraluminal pressure stimulation of visceral afferent nerve fibers at T8-T10 initial diffuse periumbilical pain inflammation extends to serosa and irritates parietal peritoneum. Pain localized to RLQ/ McBurney point (1/3 the distance from right anterior superior iliac spine to umbilicus). Nausea, fever; may perforate peritonitis. May elicit psoas, obturator, and Rovsing (severe RLQ pain with palpation of LLQ) signs; guarding and rebound tenderness on exam.

Treatment: appendectomy.

Liver tumors

Hepatic hemangioma Also called cavernous hemangioma. Most common benign liver tumor (venous malformation) A ; typically occurs at age 30–50 years. Biopsy contraindicated because of risk of hemorrhage.

Focal nodular hyperplasia Second most common benign liver tumor; occurs predominantly in females aged 35–50 years. Hyperplastic reaction of hepatocytes to an aberrant dystrophic artery. Marked by central stellate scar. Usually asymptomatic and detected incidentally.

Hepatic adenoma Rare, benign tumor, often related to oral contraceptive or anabolic steroid use; may regress spontaneously or rupture (abdominal pain and shock).

Also called hepatoma. Most common 1° malignant liver tumor in adults B . Associated with HBV (+/− cirrhosis) and all other causes of cirrhosis (including HCV, alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune disease, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency) and specific carcinogens (eg, aflatoxin from Aspergillus).

Findings: anorexia, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly. May lead to decompensation of previously stable cirrhosis (eg, ascites) and portal vein thrombosis. Spreads hematogenously.

Diagnosis: ultrasound (screening) or contrast CT/MRI C (confirmation); biopsy if diagnosis is uncertain.

Hepatic angiosarcoma Rare, malignant tumor of endothelial origin; associated with exposure to arsenic, vinyl chloride.

Metastases Most common malignant liver tumors overall; 1° sources include GI, breast, lung cancers. Metastases are rarely solitary.

Budd-Chiari syndrome Hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction

IVC

Budd-Chiari syndrome  hepatosplenomegaly  vs portal vein thrombosis  no hepatomegaly unless preexisting liver disease 

(eg, due to thrombosis, compression) with centrilobular congestion and necrosis congestive liver disease (hepatomegaly, ascites, varices, abdominal pain, liver failure). Absence of JVD. Associated with hypercoagulable states, polycythemia vera, postpartum state, HCC. May cause nutmeg liver (mottled appearance).

Portal vein thrombosis—thrombosis in portal vein proximal to liver. Usually asymptomatic in the majority of patients, but associated with portal hypertension, abdominal pain, fever. May lead to bowel ischemia if extension to superior mesenteric vein. Etiologies include cirrhosis, malignancy, pancreatitis, and sepsis.

Wilson disease

Also called hepatolenticular degeneration. Autosomal recessive mutations in hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7B gene; chromosome 13) copper incorporation into apoceruloplasmin and excretion into bile serum ceruloplasmin. Copper accumulates, especially in liver, brain (eg, basal ganglia), cornea, kidneys; urine copper.

Presents before age 40 with liver disease (eg, hepatitis, acute liver failure, cirrhosis), neurologic disease (eg, dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism), psychiatric disease, Kayser-Fleischer rings (deposits in Descemet membrane of cornea) A , hemolytic anemia, renal disease (eg, Fanconi syndrome).

Treatment: chelation with penicillamine or trientine, oral zinc. Liver transplant in acute liver failure related to Wilson disease.

(low) hepcidin production, intestinal iron absorption. Iron overload can also be 2° to chronic transfusion therapy (eg, β-thalassemia major). Iron accumulates, especially in liver, pancreas, skin, heart, pituitary, joints. Hemosiderin (iron) can be identified on liver MRI or biopsy with Prussian blue stain A .

Presents after age 40 when total body iron > 20 g; iron loss through menstruation slows progression in females. Classic triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, skin pigmentation (“bronze diabetes”). Also causes restrictive cardiomyopathy (classic) or dilated cardiomyopathy (reversible), hypogonadism, arthropathy (calcium pyrophosphate deposition; especially metacarpophalangeal joints). HCC is common cause of death.

cholesterol and/or bilirubin, bile salts, and gallbladder stasis all cause sludge or stones. 2 types of stones:

Cholelithiasis and related pathologies

Diagnose with ultrasound. Treat with elective cholecystectomy if symptomatic.

Risk factors (5 F’s): female, fat (obesity), fertile (multiparity), forty, fair.

10–20% opaque due to calcifications)—80% of stones. Associated with obesity, Crohn disease, advanced age, estrogen therapy, multiparity, rapid weight loss, medications (eg, fibrates), race ( incidence in White and Native American populations).

Most common complication is cholecystitis; can also cause acute pancreatitis, acute cholangitis.

relateD PatHologies

CHaraCteristiCs

Biliary colic Associated with nausea/vomiting and dull RUQ pain. Neurohormonal activation (eg, by CCK after a fatty meal) triggers contraction of gallbladder, forcing stone into cystic duct. Labs are normal, ultrasound shows cholelithiasis.

Choledocholithiasis Presence of gallstone(s) in common bile duct, often leading to elevated ALP, GGT, direct bilirubin, and/or AST/ALT.

Cholecystitis

Acute or chronic inflammation of gallbladder. Calculous cholecystitis—most common type; due to gallstone impaction in the cystic duct resulting

in inflammation and gallbladder wall thickening (arrows in B ); can produce 2° infection.

Acalculous cholecystitis—due to gallbladder stasis, hypoperfusion, or infection (CMV); seen in critically ill patients.

Murphy sign: inspiratory arrest on RUQ palpation due to pain. Pain may radiate to right shoulder (due to irritation of phrenic nerve). ALP if bile duct becomes involved (eg, acute cholangitis). Diagnose with ultrasound or cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan). Failure to visualize gallbladder on

HIDA scan suggests obstruction.

Gallstone ileus—fistula between gallbladder and GI tract stone enters GI lumen obstructs at ileocecal valve (narrowest point); can see air in biliary tree (pneumobilia). Rigler triad: radiographic findings of pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, gallstone (usually in iliac fossa).

Porcelain gallbladder Calcified gallbladder due to chronic cholecystitis; usually found incidentally on imaging C . Treatment: prophylactic cholecystectomy generally recommended due to risk of gallbladder cancer (mostly adenocarcinoma). C

Also called ascending cholangitis. Infection of biliary tree usually due to obstruction that leads to stasis/bacterial overgrowth.

Charcot triad of cholangitis includes jaundice, fever, RUQ pain. Reynolds pentad is Charcot triad plus altered mental status and shock (hypotension).

Cholangiocarcinoma Malignant tumor of bile duct epithelium. Most common location is convergence of right and left hepatic ducts. Risk factors include 1° sclerosing cholangitis, liver fluke infections. Usually presents late with fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, jaundice. Imaging may show biliary tract obstruction. Histology: infiltrating neoplastic glands associated with desmoplastic stroma.

Pancreatitis

Pancreatitis

Refers to inflammation of the pancreas. Usually sterile.

Acute pancreatitis

Autodigestion of pancreas by pancreatic enzymes ( A shows pancreas [yellow arrows] surrounded by

edema [red arrows]).

Causes: Idiopathic, Gallstones, Ethanol, Trauma, Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune disease,

Scorpion sting, Hypercalcemia/Hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dL), ERCP, Drugs (eg, sulfa drugs, NRTIs, protease inhibitors). I GET SMASHED.

Diagnosis by 2 of 3 criteria: acute epigastric pain often radiating to the back, serum amylase or lipase (more specific) to 3× upper limit of normal, or characteristic imaging findings.

Complications: pancreatic pseudocyst B (lined by granulation tissue, not epithelium), abscess, necrosis, hemorrhage, infection, organ failure (ALI/ARDS, shock, renal failure), hypocalcemia (precipitation of Ca2+ soaps).

Chronic inflammation, atrophy, calcification of the pancreas C . Major risk factors include alcohol use disorder and genetic predisposition (eg, cystic fibrosis, SPINK1 mutations); can be idiopathic. Complications include pancreatic insufficiency and pseudocysts.

Chronic pancreatitis

Pancreatic insufficiency (typically when <10% pancreatic function) may manifest with steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, diabetes mellitus.

Amylase and lipase may or may not be elevated (almost always elevated in acute pancreatitis).

Fetal erythropoiesis Fetal erythropoiesis occurs in:

Young liver synthesizes blood.

Yolk sac (3–8 weeks) Liver (6 weeks–birth) Spleen (10–28 weeks) Bone marrow (18 weeks to adult)

Hemoglobin development

Embryonic globins: ζ and ε. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) = α2γ2. Adult hemoglobin (HbA1) = α2β2. HbF has higher affinity for O2 due to less avid binding of 2,3-BPG, allowing HbF to extract O2 from maternal hemoglobin (HbA1 and HbA2) across the placenta. HbA2 (α2δ2) is a form of adult hemoglobin present in small amounts.

From fetal to adult hemoglobin: Alpha always; gamma goes, becomes beta.

Refer to B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. B cells and T cells mediate adaptive immunity. NK cells are part of the innate immune response. Round, densely staining nucleus with small amount of pale cytoplasm A .

Lymphocytes

Important in innate immunity, especially against intracellular pathogens. NK cells are larger than B and T cells, with distinctive cytoplasmic lytic granules (containing perforin and granzymes) that, when released, act on target cells to induce apoptosis. Distinguish between healthy and infected cells by identifying cell surface proteins (induced by stress, malignant transformation, or microbial infections). Induce apoptosis (natural killer) in cells that do not express class I MHC cell surface molecules, eg, virally infected cells in which these molecules are downregulated.

B cells

from stem cells in bone marrow and matures in marrow. Migrate to peripheral lymphoid tissue (follicles of lymph nodes, white pulp of spleen, unencapsulated lymphoid tissue). When antigen is encountered, B cells differentiate into plasma cells (which produce antibodies) and memory cells. Can function as an APC.

B = bone marrow.

CD20  CD21  CD19  B cell 

T cells

from stem cells in the bone marrow, but mature in the thymus. Differentiate into cytotoxic T cells (express CD8, recognize MHC I), helper T cells (express CD4, recognize MHC II), and regulatory T cells. CD28 (costimulatory signal) necessary for T-cell activation. Most circulating lymphocytes are T cells (80%).

T = thymus. CD4+ helper T cells are the primary target of

HIV.

Cathode

migrates from the negatively charged cathode to the positively charged anode. HbA migrates the farthest, followed by HbF, HbS, and HbC. This is because the missense mutations in HbS and HbC replace glutamic acid ⊝ with valine (neutral) and lysine ⊕, respectively, making HbC and HbS more positively charged than HbA.

A Fat Santa Claus can’t (cathode anode) go

Antiglobulin test

Also called Coombs test. Detects the presence of antibodies against circulating RBCs. Direct antiglobulin test—anti-human globulin (Coombs reagent) added to patient’s RBCs. RBCs agglutinate if RBCs are coated with anti-RBC Abs. Used for AIHA diagnosis. Indirect antiglobulin test—normal RBCs added to patient’s serum. If serum has anti-RBC Abs, RBCs agglutinate when Coombs reagent is added. Used for pretransfusion testing.

Does this patient have AIHA?

Will recipient react against donor RBCs?

VII, IX, X, protein C, protein S. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase. Vitamin K administration can potentially reverse inhibitory effect of warfarin on clotting factor synthesis (delayed).

Neonates lack enteric baKteria, which produce vitamin K. Early administration of vitamin K overcomes neonatal deficiency/coagulopathy. Suppression of gut flora by broad spectrum antibiotiKs can also contribute to deficiency. Factor VII (seven)—shortest half-life. Factor II (two)—longest (too long) half-life.

Antithrombin inhibits thrombin (factor IIa) and

factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa.

Heparin enhances the activity of antithrombin. Principal targets of antithrombin: thrombin and factor Xa.

Factor V Leiden mutation produces a factor V resistant to inhibition by activated protein C. tPA is used clinically as a thrombolytic.

Interpretation of iron studies
======================================
= 1° disturbance. Transferrin—transports iron in blood. TIBC—indirectly measures transferrin. Ferritin—1° iron storage protein of body. a Evolutionary reasoning—pathogens use circulating iron to thrive. The body has adapted a system in which iron is stored

within the cells of the body and prevents pathogens from acquiring circulating iron.

Normocytic, normochromic anemias

Normocytic, normochromic anemias are classified as nonhemolytic or hemolytic. The hemolytic anemias are further classified according to the cause of the hemolysis (intrinsic vs extrinsic to the RBC) and by the location of hemolysis (intravascular vs extravascular). Hemolysis can lead to in LDH, reticulocytes, unconjugated bilirubin, pigmented gallstones, and urobilinogen in urine.

Extravascular Hemolysis

Intravascular Hemolysis

Red blood cell  Blood vessel  Dimers bind haptoglobin  Hemoglobin  Conjugated bilirubin  Enterohepatic recirculation  Unconjugated bilirubin  Splenic macrophage  Dimers  Red blood cell  Circulated to kidneys (if haptoglobin capacity exceeded)  Urobilinogen  Urobilinogen  Hemoglobinuria  Stercobilinogen 

Findings: haptoglobin, schistocytes on blood smear. Characteristic hemoglobinuria, Intravascular hemolysis hemosiderinuria, and urobilinogen in urine. Notable causes are mechanical hemolysis (eg, prosthetic valve), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.

Extravascular hemolysis Mechanism: macrophages in spleen clear RBCs. Findings: splenomegaly, spherocytes in peripheral smear (most commonly due to hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia), no hemoglobinuria/hemosiderinuria. Can present with urobilinogen in urine.

Nonhemolytic, normocytic anemias

deScRIPtIon Inflammation (eg, IL-6) hepcidin (released by liver, binds ferroportin on intestinal mucosal cells and macrophages, thus inhibiting iron transport) release of iron from macrophages and iron absorption from gut. Associated with conditions such as chronic infections, neoplastic disorders, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases (eg, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis).

FIndIngS iron, TIBC, ferritin. Normocytic, but can become microcytic. Treatment: address underlying cause of inflammation, judicious use of blood transfusion, consider erythropoiesis- stimulating agents such as EPO (eg, in chronic kidney disease).
======================================
Anemia of chronic disease

reticulocyte count, EPO. Pancytopenia characterized by anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (vs aplastic crisis, which causes anemia only). Normal cell morphology, but hypocellular bone marrow with fatty infiltration A . Symptoms: fatigue, malaise, pallor, purpura, mucosal bleeding, petechiae, infection. Treatment: withdrawal of offending agent, immunosuppressive regimens (eg, antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine), bone marrow allograft, RBC/platelet transfusion, bone marrow stimulation (eg, GM-CSF).

Aplastic anemia

Failure or destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. Causes (reducing volume from inside diaphysis): Radiation Viral agents (eg, EBV, HIV, hepatitis viruses) Fanconi anemia (autosomal recessive DNA

repair defect bone marrow failure); normocytosis or macrocytosis on CBC. Common associated findings include short stature, café-au-lait spots, thumb/radial defects, predisposition to malignancy.

Idiopathic (immune mediated, 1° stem cell defect); may follow acute hepatitis

Drugs (eg, benzene, chloramphenicol, alkylating agents, antimetabolites)

Myeloproliferative neoplasms

Malignant hematopoietic neoplasms with varying impacts on WBCs and myeloid cell lines.

Polycythemia vera

Primary polycythemia. Disorder of RBCs, usually due to acquired JAK2 mutation. May present as intense itching after shower (aquagenic pruritus). Rare but classic symptom is erythromelalgia (severe, burning pain and red-blue coloration) due to episodic blood clots in vessels of the extremities A . Associated with hyperviscosity and thrombosis (eg, PE, DVT, Budd-Chiari syndrome).

EPO (vs 2° polycythemia, which presents with endogenous or artificially EPO). Treatment: phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor).

Essential thrombocythemia

Characterized by massive proliferation of megakaryocytes and platelets. Symptoms include

bleeding and thrombosis. Blood smear shows markedly increased number of platelets, which may be large or otherwise abnormally formed B . Erythromelalgia may occur.

Atypical megakaryocyte hyperplasia TGF-β secretion fibroblast activity obliteration of Myelofibrosis bone marrow with fibrosis. Associated with massive splenomegaly and “teardrop” RBCs C . “Bone marrow cries because it’s fibrosed and is a dry tap.”

Heparin

mechanISm

Activates antithrombin, which action primarily of factors IIa (thrombin) and Xa. Short half-life.

clInIcal USe

Immediate anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism (PE), acute coronary syndrome, MI, deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Used during pregnancy (does not cross placenta). Monitor PTT.

Bleeding (reverse with protamine sulfate), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), osteoporosis

adVeRSe eFFectS

(with long-term use), drug-drug interactions, type 4 renal tubular acidosis. HIT type 1—mild (platelets > 100,000/mm3), transient, nonimmunologic drop in platelet count that typically occurs within the first 2 days of heparin administration. Not clinically significant. HIT type 2—development of IgG antibodies against heparin-bound platelet factor 4 (PF4) that typically occurs 5–10 days after heparin administration. Antibody-heparin-PF4 complex binds and activates platelets removal by splenic macrophages and thrombosis platelet count. Highest risk with unfractionated heparin. Treatment: discontinue heparin, start alternative anticoagulant (eg, argatroban). Fondaparinux safe to use (does not interact with PF4).
======================================
noteS

Low-molecular-weight heparins (eg, enoxaparin, dalteparin) act mainly on factor Xa. Fondaparinux acts only on factor Xa. Both are not easily reversible. Unfractionated heparin used in patients with renal insufficiency (low-molecular-weight heparins should be used with caution because they undergo renal clearance).

This chapter provides information you will need to understand common anatomic dysfunctions, orthopedic conditions, rheumatic diseases, and dermatologic conditions. Be able to interpret 3D anatomy in the context of radiologic imaging. For the rheumatic diseases, create instructional cases that include the most likely presentation and symptoms: risk factors, gender, important markers (eg, autoantibodies), and other epidemiologic factors. Doing so will allow you to answer higher order questions that are likely to be asked on the exam.

Motoneuron action potential to muscle contraction

T-tubules are extensions of plasma membrane in contact with the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing for coordinated contraction of striated muscles.

Myelin sheath  Action potential  Q  Axon  Ca2+  ACh vesicle  Action potential  R  ACh  S  AChR  Motor end plate  DHPR  T  Sarcoplasmic reticulum  Ca2+  Ca2+  RR  SERCA  T-tubule  Ca2+  U  TnC  Actin  Tropomyosin  Y  ADP Pi  Ca2+   Myosin  Cocked  Myosin-binding site  V  X  ATP  ADP  W  Detached  Crossbridge  ADP  Pi  ATP  ADP  Power stroke  A  Z line  Actin (thin ﬁlament) Myosin (thick ﬁlament)  M line  H band A band  I band  I band 

Action potential opens presynaptic voltage- gated Ca2+ channels, inducing acetylcholine (ACh) release. Postsynaptic ACh binding leads to muscle cell depolarization at the motor end plate. Depolarization travels over the entire muscle cell and deep into the muscle via the T-tubules. Membrane depolarization induces conformational changes in the voltage- sensitive dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and its mechanically coupled ryanodine receptor (RR) Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (buffered by calsequestrin) into the cytoplasm. Tropomyosin is blocking myosin-binding sites on the actin filament. Released Ca2+ binds to troponin C (TnC), shifting tropomyosin to expose the myosin-binding sites. Myosin head binds strongly to actin (crossbridge). Pi released, initiating power stroke. During the power stroke, force is produced as myosin pulls on the thin filament A . Muscle shortening occurs, with shortening of H and I bands and between Z lines (HI, I’m wearing shortZ). The A band remains the same length (A band is Always the same length). ADP is released at the end of the power stroke. Binding of new ATP molecule causes detachment of myosin head from actin filament. Ca2+ is resequestered. ATP hydrolysis into ADP and Pi results in myosin head returning to high-energy position (cocked). The myosin head can bind to a new site on actin to form a crossbridge if Ca2+ remains available. Reuptake of calcium by sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) muscle relaxation.

Bone formation

Endochondral ossification

Bones of axial skeleton, appendicular skeleton, and base of skull. Cartilaginous model of bone is first made by chondrocytes. Osteoclasts and osteoblasts later replace with woven bone and then remodel to lamellar bone. In adults, woven bone occurs after fractures and in Paget disease. Defective in achondroplasia.

Membranous ossification Bones of calvarium, facial bones, and clavicle. Woven bone formed directly without cartilage. Later remodeled to lamellar bone.

Cell biology of bone

Osteoblast

Builds bone by secreting collagen and catalyzing mineralization in alkaline environment via ALP. Differentiates from mesenchymal stem cells in periosteum. Osteoblastic activity measured by bone ALP, osteocalcin, propeptides of type I procollagen.

Dissolves (“crushes”) bone by secreting H+ and collagenases. Differentiates from a fusion of Osteoclast monocyte/macrophage lineage precursors. RANK receptors on osteoclasts are stimulated by RANKL (RANK ligand, expressed on osteoblasts). OPG (osteoprotegerin, a RANKL decoy receptor) binds RANKL to prevent RANK-RANKL interaction osteoclast activity.

Parathyroid hormone At low, intermittent levels, exerts anabolic effects (building bone) on osteoblasts and osteoclasts (indirect). Chronically PTH levels (1° hyperparathyroidism) cause catabolic effects (osteitis fibrosa cystica).

Estrogen

Inhibits apoptosis in bone-forming osteoblasts and induces apoptosis in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Causes closure of epiphyseal plate during puberty. Estrogen deficiency (surgical or postmenopausal) cycles of remodeling and bone resorption risk of osteoporosis.

Osteopetrosis

Failure of normal bone resorption due to defective osteoclasts thickened, dense bones that are prone to fracture. Mutations (eg, carbonic anhydrase II) impair ability of osteoclast to generate acidic environment necessary for bone resorption. Overgrowth of cortical bone fills marrow space pancytopenia, extramedullary hematopoiesis. Can result in cranial nerve impingement and palsies due to narrowed foramina.

Gout

Acute inflammatory monoarthritis caused by precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joints. Risk factors: male sex, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, alcohol use. Strongest risk factor is hyperuricemia, which can be caused by: Underexcretion of uric acid (90% of patients)—largely idiopathic, potentiated by renal failure;
======================================
FINDINgS

can be exacerbated by alcohol and certain medications (eg, thiazide diuretics).

Overproduction of uric acid (10% of patients)—Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, PRPP excess, cell turnover (eg, tumor lysis syndrome), von Gierke disease.

Crystals are needle shaped and ⊝ birefringent under polarized light (yellow under parallel light, blue under perpendicular light A ). Serum uric acid levels may be normal during an acute attack.

Asymmetric joint distribution. Joint is swollen, red, and painful. Classic manifestation is painful MTP joint of big toe (podagra). Tophus formation B (often on external ear, olecranon bursa, or Achilles tendon). Acute attack tends to occur after a large meal with foods rich in purines (eg, red meat, seafood), trauma, surgery, dehydration, diuresis, or alcohol consumption (alcohol [beer > spirits] metabolites compete for same excretion sites in kidney as uric acid uric acid secretion and subsequent buildup in blood).

SyMPtoMS

Acute: NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin), glucocorticoids, colchicine. Chronic (preventive): xanthine oxidase inhibitors (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat).

tREatMENt

Chondrocalcinosis (cartilage calcification) on x-ray. Crystals are rhomboid and weakly ⊕ birefringent under polarized light (blue when parallel to light) A . Acute treatment: NSAIDs, colchicine, glucocorticoids. Prophylaxis: colchicine. The blue P’s of CPPD—blue (when parallel), positive birefringence, calcium pyrophosphate, pseudogout.

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease

Formerly called pseudogout. Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals within the joint space. Occurs in patients > 50 years old; both sexes affected equally. Usually idiopathic, sometimes associated with hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, joint trauma.

Pain and swelling with acute inflammation (pseudogout) and/or chronic degeneration (pseudo-osteoarthritis). Most commonly affected joint is the knee.

Systemic, remitting, and relapsing autoimmune disease. Organ damage primarily due to a type III hypersensitivity reaction and, to a lesser degree, a type II hypersensitivity reaction. Associated with deficiency of early complement proteins (eg, C1q, C4, C2) clearance of immune complexes. Classic presentation: facial rash (spares nasolabial folds), joint pain, and fever in a female of reproductive age. prevalence in Black, Caribbean, Asian, and Hispanic populations in the US.

Libman-Sacks Endocarditis (LSE in SLE). Lupus nephritis (glomerular deposition of DNA-anti-DNA immune complexes) can be nephritic or nephrotic (causing hematuria or proteinuria). Most common and severe type is diffuse proliferative.

Common causes of death in SLE: renal disease (most common), infections, cardiovascular disease (accelerated CAD). Lupus patients die with redness in their cheeks.

In an anti-SSA ⊕ pregnant patient, risk of newborn developing neonatal lupus congenital heart block, periorbital/diffuse rash, transaminitis, and cytopenias at birth.

Mixed connective tissue disease

Features of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and/or polymyositis. Associated with anti-U1 RNP antibodies (speckled ANA).

Antiphospholipid syndrome

1° or 2° autoimmune disorder (most commonly in SLE).

Anticardiolipin antibodies can cause false- positive VDRL/RPR.

Diagnosed based on clinical criteria including history of thrombosis (arterial or venous) or recurrent abortion along with laboratory findings of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibodies.

Lupus anticoagulant can cause prolonged PTT that is not corrected by the addition of normal platelet-free plasma.

Treatment: systemic anticoagulation.

Skin cancer

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) more common above upper lip.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) more common below lower

lip.

Sun exposure strongly predisposes to skin cancer.

Basal cell carcinoma Most common skin cancer. Found in sun-exposed areas of body (eg, face). Locally invasive, but rarely metastasizes. Waxy, pink, pearly nodules, commonly with telangiectasias, rolled borders A , central crusting or ulceration. BCCs also appear as nonhealing ulcers with infiltrating growth B or as a scaling plaque (superficial BCC) C . Basal cell tumors have “palisading” (aligned) nuclei D .

Squamous cell carcinoma Second most common skin cancer. Associated with immunosuppression, chronic nonhealing wounds, and occasionally arsenic exposure. Marjolin ulcer—SCC arising in chronic wounds or scars; usually develops > 20 years after insult. Commonly appears on face E , lower lip F , ears, hands. Locally invasive, may spread to lymph nodes, and will rarely metastasize. Ulcerative red lesions. Histopathology: keratin “pearls” G .

Actinic keratosis—Premalignant lesions caused by sun exposure. Small, rough, erythematous or brownish papules or plaques H . Risk of squamous cell carcinoma is proportional to degree of epithelial dysplasia.

Melanoma

Common tumor with significant risk of metastasis. S-100 tumor marker. Associated with dysplastic nevi; people with lighter skin tones are at risk. Depth of tumor (Breslow thickness) correlates with risk of metastasis. Look for the ABCDEs: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter > 6 mm, and Evolution over time. At least 4 different types of melanoma, including superficial spreading I , nodular J , lentigo maligna K , and acral lentiginous (highest prevalence in people with darker skin tones) L . Often driven by activating mutation in BRAF kinase. Primary treatment is excision with appropriately wide margins. Advanced melanoma also treated with immunotherapy (eg, ipilimumab) and/or BRAF inhibitors (eg, vemurafenib).

➊ Resting membrane potential: membrane is more permeable to K+ than Na+ at rest. Voltage-gated

Na+ and K+ channels are closed.

➋ Membrane depolarization: Na+ activation gate opens Na+ flows inward. ➌ Membrane repolarization: Na+ inactivation gate closes at peak potential, thus stopping Na+

inflow. K+ activation gate opens K+ flows outward.

➍ Membrane hyperpolarization: K+ activation gates are slow to close excess K+ efflux and brief period of hyperpolarization. Voltage-gated Na+ channels switch back to resting state. Na+/K+ pump restores ions concentration.

Spinal nerves

There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal. Nerves C1–C7 exit above the corresponding vertebrae (eg, C3 exits above the 3rd cervical vertebra). C8 spinal nerve exits below C7 and above T1. All other nerves exit below (eg, L2 exits below the 2nd lumbar vertebra).

Spinal cord—lower extent

In adults, spinal cord ends at lower border of

L1–L2 vertebrae. Subarachnoid space (which contains the CSF) extends to lower border of S2 vertebra. Lumbar puncture is usually performed between L3–L4 or L4–L5 (level of cauda equina) to obtain sample of CSF while avoiding spinal cord. To keep the cord alive, keep the spinal needle between L3 and L5.

Ischemic brain disease/stroke

Irreversible neuronal injury begins after 5 minutes of hypoxia. Most vulnerable: hippocampus (CA1 region), neocortex, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), watershed areas (“vulnerable hippos need pure water”).

Stroke imaging: noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (before tPA can be given). CT detects ischemic changes in 6–24 hr. Diffusion-weighted MRI can detect ischemia within 3–30 min.
======================================
12–24 hours Eosinophilic cytoplasm + pyknotic nuclei (red neurons) Ischemia infarction liquefactive necrosis. 3 types:

Ischemic stroke

Thrombotic—due to a clot forming directly at site of infarction (commonly the MCA A ), usually over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.

Embolic—due to an embolus from another part of the body. Can affect multiple vascular territories. Examples: atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, DVT with patent foramen ovale (paradoxical embolism), infective endocarditis.

Hypoxic—due to systemic hypoperfusion or hypoxemia. Common during cardiovascular surgeries, tends to affect watershed areas.

Treatment: tPA (if within 3–4.5 hr of onset and no hemorrhage/risk of hemorrhage) and/or thrombectomy (if large artery occlusion). Reduce risk with medical therapy (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel); optimum control of blood pressure, blood sugars, lipids; smoking cessation; and treat conditions that risk (eg, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis).

Transient ischemic attack

Brief, reversible episode of focal neurologic dysfunction without acute infarction (⊝ MRI), with the majority resolving in < 15 minutes; ischemia (eg, embolus, small vessel stenosis). May present with amaurosis fugax (transient visual loss) due to retinal artery emboli from carotid artery disease.

Fluid accumulation in brain parenchyma ICP. Types:

Cerebral edema

Cytotoxic edema—intracellular fluid accumulation due to osmotic shift (eg, Na+/K+-ATPase dysfunction intracellular Na+). Caused by ischemia (early), hyperammonemia, SIADH. Vasogenic edema—extracellular fluid accumulation due to disruption of BBB ( permeability). Caused by ischemia (late), trauma, hemorrhage, inflammation, tumors (arrows in A show surrounding vasogenic edema).

Focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial)—impaired consciousness, automatisms

Causes of seizures by age:

Children < 18—genetic, infection (febrile), trauma, congenital, metabolic

Generalized seizures

Diffuse. Types:

Absence (petit mal)—3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges, short (usually 10 seconds) and frequent episodes of blank stare, no postictal confusion. Can be triggered by hyperventilation

Adults > 65—stroke, tumor, trauma, metabolic, infection

Myoclonic—quick, repetitive jerks; no loss of consciousness

Tonic-clonic (grand mal)—alternating stiffening and movement, postictal confusion, urinary incontinence, tongue biting

Tonic—stiffening Atonic—“drop” seizures (falls to floor);

commonly mistaken for fainting

Headaches

Pain due to irritation of intra- or extracranial structures (eg, meninges, blood vessels). Primary headaches include tension-type, migraine, and cluster. Secondary headaches include medication overuse, meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, neoplasia, giant cell arteritis.
======================================
Trigeminal neuralgia Recurrent brief episodes of intense unilateral pain in CN V distribution (usually V2 and/or V3). Most cases are due to compression of CN V root by an aberrant vascular loop. Pain is described as electric shock–like or stabbing and usually lasts seconds. Typically triggered by light facial touch or facial movements (eg, chewing, talking). Treatment: carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine.

small handwriting (micrographia) Postural instability (tendency to fall)

Dementia is usually a late finding.

Affected neurons contain Lewy bodies:

intracellular eosinophilic inclusions composed of α-synuclein B . Think “Parkinsynuclein.” A

Huntington disease

Loss of GABAergic neurons in striatum. Autosomal dominant trinucleotide (CAG)n repeat expansion in huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4 (4 letters) toxic gain of function.

Symptoms typically manifest between age 30

and 50: chorea, athetosis, aggression, depression, dementia (sometimes initially mistaken for substance use).

Atrophy of caudate and putamen with ex vacuo ventriculomegaly. dopamine, GABA, ACh in brain. Neuronal death via NMDA receptor binding and glutamate excitotoxicity. Anticipation results from expansion of CAG repeats. Caudate loses ACh and GABA.

Dementia

Decline in cognitive ability (eg, memory, executive function) with intact consciousness. Reversible causes of dementia include depression (pseudodementia), hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurosyphilis, normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Also called pseudotumor cerebri. ICP with no obvious findings on imaging. Risk factors include female sex, Tetracyclines, Obesity, vitamin A excess, Danazol (female TOAD). Associated with dural venous sinus stenosis. Findings: headache, tinnitus, diplopia (usually from CN VI palsy), no change in mental status. Impaired optic nerve axoplasmic flow papilledema. Visual field testing shows enlarged blind spot and peripheral constriction. Lumbar puncture reveals opening pressure and provides temporary headache relief. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

Treatment: weight loss, acetazolamide, invasive procedures for refractory cases (eg, CSF shunt placement, optic nerve sheath fenestration surgery for visual loss).

Hydrocephalus

Hydrocephalus

CSF volume ventricular dilation +/− ICP.

Communicating

Communicating hydrocephalus

CSF absorption by arachnoid granulations (eg, arachnoid scarring post-meningitis) ICP,

papilledema, herniation.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus

Affects older adults; idiopathic; CSF pressure elevated only episodically; does not result in increased subarachnoid space volume. Expansion of ventricles A distorts the fibers of the corona radiata triad of gait apraxia (magnetic gait), cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. “Wobbly, wacky, and wet.” Symptoms potentially reversible with CSF drainage via lumbar puncture or shunt placement.

Noncommunicating (obstructive)

Noncommunicating hydrocephalus

Caused by structural blockage of CSF circulation within ventricular system (eg, stenosis of

aqueduct of Sylvius, colloid cyst blocking foramen of Monro, tumor B ).

Hydrocephalus mimics

Appearance of CSF on imaging C , but is actually due to brain tissue and neuronal atrophy (eg, Alzheimer disease, advanced HIV, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease). ICP is normal; NPH triad is not seen.

Pyramidal tract demyelination (eg, weakness, spasticity) Spinal cord syndromes (eg, electric shock–like sensation along cervical spine on neck flexion, neurogenic bladder, paraparesis, sensory manifestations affecting the trunk or one or more extremities)

Symptoms may exacerbate with increased body temperature (eg, hot bath, exercise). Relapsing and remitting is most common clinical course.

IgG level and myelin basic protein in CSF. Oligoclonal bands aid in diagnosis. MRI is gold Findings standard. Periventricular plaques A (areas of oligodendrocyte loss and reactive gliosis). Multiple white matter lesions disseminated in space and time.

Stop relapses and halt/slow progression with disease-modifying therapies (eg, β-interferon, glatiramer, natalizumab). Treat acute flares with IV steroids. Symptomatic treatment for neurogenic bladder (catheterization, muscarinic antagonists, botulinum toxin injection), spasticity (baclofen, GABAB receptor agonists), pain (TCAs, anticonvulsants). treAtment

Destruction of anterior horns by poliovirus. Fecal-oral transmission replication in lymphoid

tissue of oropharynx and small intestine spread to CNS via bloodstream.

Acute LMN signs (asymmetric weakness) and symptoms of viral meningitis (eg, fever, headache,

@e

neck stiffness). Respiratory muscle involvement leads to respiratory failure.

CSF shows WBCs (lymphocytic pleocytosis) and slight of protein (with no change in CSF

glucose). Poliovirus can be isolated from stool or throat secretions.

Spinal muscular atrophy

Posterior spinal arteries

Congenital degeneration of anterior horns. Autosomal recessive SMN1 mutation (encodes survival motor neuron protein) defective snRNP assembly LMN apoptosis. Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (most common) is also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease.

LMN signs only (symmetric weakness). “Floppy baby” with marked hypotonia (flaccid paralysis) and tongue fasciculations.

Combined UMN (corticospinal/corticobulbar) and LMN (brainstem/spinal cord) degeneration. Usually idiopathic. Familial form (less common) may be linked to SOD1 mutations (encodes superoxide dismutase 1). ALS is also called Lou Gehrig disease. Posterior spinal arteries

Amyotrophic lateral Anterior spinal artery sclerosis

Posterior spinal arteries 

LMN signs: flaccid limb weakness, fasciculations, atrophy, bulbar palsy (dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue atrophy). UMN signs: spastic limb weakness, hyperreflexia, clonus, pseudobulbar palsy (dysarthria, dysphagia, emotional lability). No sensory or bowel/bladder deficits. Fatal (most often from respiratory failure). Treatment: riluzole (“riLouzole”).

Tabes dorsalis

Posterior spinal arteries  Anterior spinal artery 

Degeneration/demyelination of dorsal columns and roots by T pallidum (3° syphilis). Causes progressive sensory ataxia (impaired proprioception poor coordination). ⊕ Romberg sign and absent DTRs. Associated with shooting pain, Argyll Robertson pupils, Charcot joints.
======================================
Posterior spinal arteries

Subacute combined degeneration Anterior spinal artery

Demyelination of Spinocerebellar tracts, lateral Corticospinal tracts, and Dorsal columns (SCD) due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Ataxic gait, paresthesias, impaired position/vibration sense (⊕ Romberg sign), UMN signs.

Anterior spinal artery occlusion

Posterior spinal arteries

Spinal cord infarction sparing dorsal columns and Lissauer tract. Watershed area is mid-thoracic ASA territory, as the artery of Adamkiewicz supplies ASA below T8. Can be caused by aortic aneurysm repair.

Presents with UMN signs below the lesion (corticospinal tract), LMN signs at the level of the lesion (anterior horn), and loss of pain and temperature sensation below the lesion (spinothalamic tract).

If lesion occurs above T1, patient may present with ipsilateral Horner syndrome due to damage of oculosympathetic pathway.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Diabetes mellitus Kyphoscoliosis  High arches (pes cavus)  Hammer toe 

Autosomal recessive trinucleotide repeat disorder (GAA)n on chromosome 9 in gene that encodes frataxin (iron-binding protein). Leads to impairment in mitochondrial functioning. Degeneration of lateral corticospinal tract (spastic paralysis), spinocerebellar tract (ataxia), dorsal columns ( vibratory sense, proprioception), and dorsal root ganglia (loss of DTRs). Staggering gait, frequent falling, nystagmus, dysarthria, pes cavus, hammer toes, diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (cause of death). Presents in childhood with kyphoscoliosis A .

Friedreich is fratastic (frataxin): he’s your favorite frat brother, always staggering and falling but has a sweet, big heart. Ataxic GAAit.
======================================
Cerebral palsy

Permanent motor dysfunction resulting from nonprogressive injury to developing fetal/infant brain. Most common movement disorder in children.

Multifactorial etiology; prematurity and low birth weight are the strongest risk factors. Associated with development of periventricular leukomalacia (focal necrosis of white matter tracts).

Presents with UMN signs (eg, spasticity, hyperreflexia) affecting ≥ 1 limbs, persistence of primitive reflexes, abnormal posture, developmental delay in motor skills, neurobehavioral abnormalities (excessive docility, irritability).

Auricle (pinna)

Outer ear

Visible portion of ear (pinna), includes auditory canal and tympanic membrane. Transfers sound waves via vibration of tympanic membrane.

Middle ear Air-filled space with three bones called the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes). Ossicles conduct and amplify sound from tympanic membrane to inner ear.

Inner ear Snail-shaped, fluid-filled cochlea. Contains basilar membrane that vibrates 2° to sound waves. Vibration transduced via specialized hair cells auditory nerve signaling brainstem.

Each frequency leads to vibration at specific location on basilar membrane (tonotopy):

Low frequency heard at apex near helicotrema (wide and flexible). High frequency heard best at base of cochlea (thin and rigid).

Otitis externa

Inflammation of external auditory canal. Most commonly due to Pseudomonas. Associated with water exposure (swimmer’s ear), ear canal trauma/occlusion (eg, hearing aids). Presents with otalgia that worsens with ear manipulation, pruritus, hearing loss, discharge A . Malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa—invasive infection causing osteomyelitis. Complication of otitis externa mostly seen in older patients with diabetes. Presents with severe otalgia and otorrhea. May lead to cranial nerve palsies. Physical exam shows granulation tissue in ear canal.

Otitis media

Inflammation of middle ear. Most commonly due to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae,

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Associated with eustachian tube dysfunction, which promotes overgrowth of bacterial colonizers of upper respiratory tract.

Usually seen in children < 2 years old. Presents with fever, otalgia, hearing loss. Physical exam shows bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane A that may rupture.

Mastoiditis—infection of mastoid process of temporal bone. Complication of acute otitis media due to continuity of middle ear cavity with mastoid air cells. Presents with postauricular pain, erythema, swelling. May lead to brain abscess.

Common causes of hearing loss
======================================
Aging-related progressive bilateral/symmetric sensorineural hearing loss (often of higher frequencies)

Diagnosing hearing loss

Normal  Conductive  Sensorineural  Weber test Tuning fork on vertex of skull  Localizes to affected ear  ↓ transmission of background noise  Localizes to unaffected ear ↓ transmission of all sound  No localization  Rinne test Tuning fork in front of ear (air conduction, AC), Tuning fork on mastoid process (bone conduction, BC)  AC > BC  BC > AC  AC > BC 

Cholesteatoma

Abnormal growth of keratinized squamous epithelium in middle ear A (“skin in wrong place”). Usually acquired, but can be congenital. 1° acquired results from tympanic membrane retraction pockets that form due to eustachian tube dysfunction. 2° acquired results from tympanic membrane perforation (eg, due to otitis media) that permits migration of squamous epithelium to middle ear. Classically presents with painless otorrhea. May erode ossicles conductive hearing loss.

Vertigo

Vertigo

Sensation of spinning while actually stationary. Subtype of “dizziness,” but distinct from

“lightheadedness.” Peripheral vertigo is more common than central vertigo.

Peripheral vertigo Due to inner ear pathologies such as semicircular canal debris (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), vestibular neuritis, Ménière disease—endolymphatic hydrops ( endolymph in inner ear) triad of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus (“men wear vests”). Findings: mixed horizontal-torsional nystagmus (never purely torsional or vertical) that does not change direction and is suppressible with visual fixation.

Central vertigo Due to brainstem or cerebellar lesions (eg, stroke affecting vestibular nuclei, demyelinating disease, or posterior fossa tumor). Findings: nystagmus of any direction that is not suppressible with visual fixation, neurologic findings (eg, diplopia, ataxia, dysmetria).

Optic neuropathy causing progressive vision loss (peripheral central). Usually, but not always, accompanied by intraocular pressure (IOP). Etiology is most often 1°, but can be 2° to an identifiable cause (eg, uveitis, glucocorticoids). Funduscopy: optic disc cupping (normal A vs thinning of outer rim of optic disc B ). Treatment: pharmacologic or surgical lowering of IOP.

Open-angle glaucoma Anterior chamber angle is open (normal). Most common type in US. Associated with resistance to aqueous humor drainage through trabecular meshwork. Risk factors: age, race ( incidence in Black population), family history, diabetes mellitus. Typically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally.

Angle-closure glaucoma Anterior chamber angle is narrowed or closed. Associated with anatomic abnormalities (eg, anteriorly displaced lens resting against central iris) aqueous flow through pupil (pupillary block) pressure buildup in posterior chamber peripheral iris pushed against cornea obstruction of drainage pathways by the iris. Usually chronic and asymptomatic, but may develop acutely.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma—complete pupillary block causing abrupt angle closure and rapid IOP. Presents with severe eye pain, conjunctival erythema C , sudden vision loss, halos around lights, headache, fixed and mid-dilated pupil, nausea and vomiting. Hurts in a hurry with halos, a headache, and a “half-dilated” pupil. True ophthalmic emergency that requires immediate management to prevent blindness. Mydriatic agents are contraindicated.

Retinal disorders (continued)

Retinoblastoma

Most common intraocular malignancy in children. Arises from immature retinal cells A . Caused by mutations to both RB1 tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 13, which normally impede G1 S phase progression. Can be sporadic or familial (loss of heterozygosity). Presents with leukocoria, strabismus, nystagmus, eye redness.

Leukocoria

Loss (whitening) of the red reflex. Important causes in children include retinoblastoma A , congenital cataract.

Inflammation of uvea; specific name based on location within affected eye. Anterior uveitis: iritis; posterior uveitis: choroiditis and/or retinitis. May have hypopyon (accumulation of pus in anterior chamber A ) or conjunctival redness. Associated with systemic inflammatory disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, Behçet syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, HLA-B27–associated conditions).

Pupillary control

Miosis

Constriction, parasympathetic:

1st neuron: Edinger-Westphal nucleus to ciliary ganglion via CN III 2nd neuron: short ciliary nerves to sphincter pupillae muscles

Short ciliary nerves shorten the pupil diameter.

Pupillary light reflex

Light in either retina sends a signal via CN II to pretectal nuclei (dashed lines in image) in midbrain that activates bilateral Edinger- Westphal nuclei; pupils constrict bilaterally (direct and consensual reflex).

Result: illumination of 1 eye results in bilateral

pupillary constriction.

Mydriasis

Mydriasis

Dilation, sympathetic:

1st neuron: hypothalamus to ciliospinal center of Budge (C8–T2) 2nd neuron: exit at T1 to superior cervical ganglion (travels along cervical sympathetic chain

near lung apex, subclavian vessels)

3rd neuron: plexus along internal carotid, through cavernous sinus; enters orbit as long ciliary nerve to pupillary dilator muscles. Sympathetic fibers also innervate smooth muscle of eyelids (minor retractors) and sweat glands of forehead and face.

Long ciliary nerves make the pupil diameter longer.

Also called Marcus Gunn pupil. Extent of pupillary constriction differs when light is shone in one eye at a time due to unilateral or asymmetric lesions of afferent limb of pupillary reflex (eg, retina, optic nerve). When light shines into a normal eye, constriction of the ipsilateral eye (direct reflex) and contralateral eye (consensual reflex) is observed. When light is swung from a normal eye to an affected eye, both pupils dilate instead of constricting.

Cranial nerve III, IV, VI palsies

CN III damage

CN III

CN III has both motor (central) and

parasympathetic (peripheral) components. Common causes include: Ischemia pupil sparing (motor fibers

affected more than parasympathetic fibers)

Uncal herniation coma PCom aneurysm sudden-onset headache Cavernous sinus thrombosis proptosis,

involvement of CNs IV, V1/V2, VI

Midbrain stroke contralateral hemiplegia Motor output to extraocular muscles—affected primarily by vascular disease (eg, diabetes mellitus: glucose sorbitol) due to diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to the interior (middle) fibers from compromised vasculature that resides on outside of nerve. Signs: ptosis, “down-and-out” gaze.

Motor = middle (central) Parasympathetic = peripheral  A 

Parasympathetic output—fibers on the periphery are first affected by compression (eg, PCom aneurysm, uncal herniation). Signs: diminished or absent pupillary light reflex, “blown pupil” often with “down-and-out” gaze A .

CN IV damage

Pupil is higher in the affected eye B . Characteristic head tilt to contralateral/ unaffected side to compensate for lack of intorsion in affected eye. Can’t see the floor with CN IV damage (eg, difficulty going down stairs, reading).

CN VI damage Affected eye unable to abduct C and is displaced medially in primary position of gaze.

` neurology—oPhthAlmology Neurology aNd Special SeNSeS

Medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF): pair of tracts that interconnect CN VI and CN III nuclei. Coordinates both eyes to move in same horizontal direction. Highly myelinated (must communicate quickly so eyes move at same time). Lesions may be unilateral or bilateral (latter classically seen in multiple sclerosis, stroke).

MLF in MS. When looking left, the left nucleus of CN VI

fires, which contracts the left lateral rectus and stimulates the contralateral (right) nucleus of CN III via the right MLF to contract the right medial rectus.

Directional term (eg, right INO, left INO) refers to the eye that is unable to adduct.

(INO), a conjugate horizontal gaze palsy. Lack of communication such that when CN VI nucleus activates ipsilateral lateral rectus, contralateral CN III nucleus does not stimulate medial rectus to contract. Abducting eye displays nystagmus (CN VI overfires to stimulate CN III). Convergence normal.

Barbiturates

Phenobarbital, pentobarbital. Facilitate GABA A action by duration of Cl− channel opening, thus neuron firing (barbidurates duration).

meChAnism

Sedative for anxiety, seizures, insomnia.

CliniCAl use

Respiratory and cardiovascular depression (can be fatal); CNS depression (can be exacerbated by

AdVerse eFFeCts

alcohol use); dependence; drug interactions (induces cytochrome P-450).

Overdose treatment is supportive (assist respiration and maintain BP). Contraindicated in porphyria.

Benzodiazepines

Diazepam, lorazepam, triazolam, temazepam, oxazepam, midazolam, chlordiazepoxide,

alprazolam. Facilitate GABA A action by frequency of Cl– channel opening (“frenzodiazepines” frequency). REM sleep. Most have long half-lives and active metabolites (exceptions [ATOM]: Alprazolam, Triazolam, Oxazepam, and Midazolam are short acting higher addictive potential).
======================================
meChAnism

Anxiety, panic disorder, spasticity, status epilepticus (lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam), eclampsia, medically supervised withdrawal (eg, alcohol/DTs; long-acting chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are preferred), night terrors, sleepwalking, general anesthetic (amnesia, muscle relaxation), hypnotic (insomnia). Lorazepam, Oxazepam, and Temazepam can be used for those with liver disease who drink a LOT due to minimal first-pass metabolism.

Dependence, additive CNS depression effects with alcohol and barbiturates (all bind the GABA A receptor). Less risk of respiratory depression and coma than with barbiturates. Treat overdose with flumazenil (competitive antagonist at GABA benzodiazepine receptor). Can precipitate seizures by causing acute benzodiazepine withdrawal. AdVerse eFFeCts

Classical conditioning

Learning in which a natural response (salivation) is elicited by a conditioned, or learned, stimulus (bell) that previously was presented in conjunction with an unconditioned stimulus (food).

Usually elicits involuntary responses. Pavlov’s classical experiments with dogs— ringing the bell provoked salivation.

Operant conditioning Learning in which a particular action is elicited because it produces a punishment or reward. Usually elicits voluntary responses.

Grief

Natural feeling that occurs in response to the death of a loved one. Symptoms and trajectory vary for each individual, are specific to each loss, and do not follow a fixed series of stages. In addition to guilt, sadness, and yearning, patients may experience somatic symptoms, hallucinations of the deceased, and/or transient episodes of wishing they had died with or instead of their loved one. Typical acute grief is time limited (adaptations within 6 months) and is not a disorder. Prolonged grief disorder—diagnosed if thoughts are persistent and prolonged, significantly impair functioning, and do not meet criteria for another disorder (eg, major depressive disorder [MDD]).

Patients’ ability to know the date and time, where they are, and who they are (order of loss: time place person). Common causes of loss of orientation: alcohol, drugs, fluid/electrolyte imbalance, head trauma, hypoglycemia, infection, nutritional deficiencies, hypoxia.
======================================
Dissociative disorders

Depersonalization/ derealization disorder

Persistent feelings of detachment or estrangement from one’s own body, thoughts, perceptions, and actions (depersonalization) or one’s environment (derealization). Intact reality testing (vs psychosis).

Dissociative amnesia

Inability to recall important personal information, usually following severe trauma or stress. May be accompanied by dissociative fugue (abrupt, unexpected travelling away from home).

Dissociative identity disorder Formerly called multiple personality disorder. Presence of ≥ 2 distinct identities or personality states, typically with distinct memories and patterns of behavior. More common in females. Associated with history of sexual abuse, PTSD, depression, substance use, borderline personality disorder, somatic symptom disorders.

Delirium

“Waxing and waning” level of consciousness with acute onset, attention span, level of arousal. Characterized by disorganized thinking, hallucinations (often visual), misperceptions (eg, illusions), disturbance in sleep-wake cycle, cognitive dysfunction, agitation. Reversible.

Delirium = changes in sensorium. EEG may show diffuse background rhythm

Treatment: identification and management of underlying condition. Orientation protocols (eg, keeping a clock or calendar nearby), sleep disturbances, and cognitive stimulation to manage symptoms. Antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) as needed. Avoid unnecessary restraints and drugs that may worsen delirium (eg, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids).

Usually 2° to other identifiable illness (eg, CNS

disease, infection, trauma, substance use/ withdrawal, metabolic/electrolyte disturbances, hemorrhage, urinary/fecal retention), or medications (eg, anticholinergics), especially in older adults.

Most common presentation of altered mental status in inpatient setting, especially in the ICU or during prolonged hospital stays.

======================================
Bipolar disorder

Major depressive disorder

MDD with psychotic features MDD + hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic features are typically mood congruent (eg, depressive themes of inadequacy, guilt, punishment, nihilism, disease, or death) and occur only in the context of major depressive episode (vs schizoaffective disorder). Treatment: antidepressant with atypical antipsychotic, ECT.

Persistent depressive disorder

Also called dysthymia. Often milder than MDD; ≥ 2 depressive symptoms lasting ≥ 2 years (≥ 1

year in children), with any remission lasting ≤ 2 months.

MDD with seasonal pattern

Formerly called seasonal affective disorder. Major depressive episodes occurring only during a particular season (usually winter) in ≥ 2 consecutive years and in most years across a lifetime. Atypical symptoms common. Treatment: standard MDD therapies + light therapy.

Depression with atypical features Characterized by mood reactivity (transient improvement in response to a positive event), hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis (heavy feeling in arms and legs), long-standing interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Most common subtype of depression. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line. MAO inhibitors are effective but not first line because of their risk profile.

Risk factors include first pregnancy, family history, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, recent medication change. Treatment: hospitalization and initiation of atypical antipsychotic; if insufficient, ECT may be used.

Rapid-acting method to treat refractory depression, depression with psychotic symptoms, catatonia, and acute suicidality. Induces tonic-clonic seizure under anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade. Adverse effects include disorientation, headache, partial anterograde/retrograde amnesia usually resolving in 6 months. No absolute contraindications. Safe in pregnant individuals and older adults.

Risk factors for suicide death

Sex (male) Age (young adult or older adult) Depression Previous attempt (highest risk factor) Ethanol or drug use Rational thinking loss (psychosis) Sickness (medical illness) Organized plan No spouse or other social support Stated future intent

SAD PERSONS are more likely to die from suicide. Most common method in US is firearms; access to guns risk of suicide death. Women try more often; men die more often. Other risk factors include recent psychiatric hospitalization and family history of suicide death. Protective factors include effective care for comorbidities; medical, familial, or community connectedness; cultural/religious beliefs encouraging self-preservation; and strong problem-solving skills.

Anxiety disorders Inappropriate experiences of fear/worry and their physical manifestations incongruent with the magnitude of the stressors. Symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition (eg, psychiatric disorder, hyperthyroidism) or substance use. Includes panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, and selective mutism.

Sleep terror disorder Periods of inconsolable terror with screaming in the middle of the night. Most common in children. Occurs during slow-wave/deep (stage N3) non-REM sleep with no memory of the arousal episode, as opposed to nightmares that occur during REM sleep (remembering a scary dream). Triggers include emotional stress, fever, and lack of sleep. Usually self limited.

Nighttime urinary incontinence ≥ 2 times/week for ≥ 3 months in person > 5 years old. First-line treatment: behavioral modification (eg, scheduled voids, nighttime fluid restriction) and positive reinforcement. For refractory cases: bedwetting alarm, oral desmopressin (ADH analog; preferred over imipramine due to fewer adverse effects).

Narcolepsy

Excessive daytime sleepiness (despite awakening well-rested) with recurrent episodes of rapid-onset,

overwhelming sleepiness ≥ 3 times/week for the last 3 months. Due to orexin (hypocretin) production in lateral hypothalamus and dysregulated sleep-wake cycles. Associated with: Hypnagogic (just before going to sleep) or hypnopompic (just before awakening; get pomped

up in the morning) hallucinations.

Nocturnal and narcoleptic sleep episodes that start with REM sleep (sleep paralysis). Cataplexy (loss of all muscle tone following strong emotional stimulus, such as laughter).

Treatment: good sleep hygiene (scheduled naps, regular sleep schedule), daytime stimulants (eg, amphetamines, modafinil) and/or nighttime sodium oxybate (GHB).
======================================
Substance use disorder

Maladaptive pattern of substance use involving ≥ 2 of the following in the past year:

Tolerance Withdrawal Intense, distracting cravings Using more, or longer, than intended Persistent desire but inability to cut down Time-consuming substance acquisition, use, or recovery Impaired functioning at work, school, or home Social or interpersonal conflicts Reduced recreational activities > 1 episode of use involving danger (eg, unsafe sex, driving while impaired) Continued use despite awareness of harm

In the case of appropriate medical treatment with prescribed medications (eg, opioid analgesics, sedatives, stimulants), symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal do not indicate a substance use disorder.

Gambling disorder Persistent, recurrent, problematic gambling that cannot be better explained as a manic episode. Diagnosis made if patient meets ≥ 4 of the following criteria:

Is preoccupied with gambling Requires more gambling to reach desired level of excitement Has failed efforts to limit, cut back, or stop gambling Becomes restless or irritable when limiting or attempting to stop gambling Gambles to escape or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, or depression After losing money gambling, continues gambling in an attempt to recover losses Lies to conceal the extent of gambling Puts at risk or has lost significant relationship, career, or academic pursuits because of gambling Relies on money from others to fix financial collapse due to gambling

Treatment: psychotherapy.

Duplex collecting system Bifurcation of ureteric bud before it enters the metanephric blastema creates a Y-shaped bifid ureter. Duplex collecting system can alternatively occur through two ureteric buds reaching and interacting with metanephric blastema. Strongly associated with vesicoureteral reflux and/or ureteral obstruction, risk for UTIs. Frequently presents with hydronephrosis.

Course of ureters

Course of ureter A : arises from renal pelvis, travels under gonadal arteries over common iliac artery under uterine artery/vas deferens (retroperitoneal).

Water (ureters) flows over the iliacs and under the bridge (uterine artery or vas deferens).

Median  umbilical  ligament  Ureter  Vas deferens  (in male)  Uterine artery (in female)  Detrusor muscle  Ureteral oriﬁce  Trigone  Internal urethral oriﬁce  Prostate 

Gynecologic procedures (eg, ligation of

uterine or ovarian vessels) may damage ureter ureteral obstruction or leak.

Bladder contraction compresses the intramural ureter, preventing urine reflux.

Blood supply to ureter:
======================================
Proximal—renal arteries Middle—gonadal artery, aorta, common and

internal iliac arteries

Distal—internal iliac and superior vesical arteries

3 common points of ureteral obstruction: ureteropelvic junction, pelvic inlet, ureterovesical junction.

Renal clearance

Cx = (UxV)/Px = volume of plasma from which the substance is completely cleared in the urine per unit time. If Cx < GFR: net tubular reabsorption and/or not freely filtered. If Cx > GFR: net tubular secretion of X. If Cx = GFR: no net secretion or reabsorption.

Cx = clearance of X (mL/min). Ux = urine concentration of X (eg, mg/mL). Px = plasma concentration of X (eg, mg/mL). V = urine flow rate (mL/min).

Glomerular filtration rate Inulin clearance can be used to calculate GFR because it is freely filtered and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted.

Cinulin = GFR = Uinulin × V/Pinulin = Kf [(PGC – PBS) – (πGC – πBS)]

(PGC = glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure; PBS = Bowman space hydrostatic pressure; πGC = glomerular capillary oncotic pressure; πBS = Bowman space oncotic pressure; πBS normally equals zero; Kf = filtration coefficient).

Normal GFR ≈ 100 mL/min. Creatinine clearance is an approximate measure of GFR. Slightly overestimates GFR because creatinine is moderately secreted by renal tubules.

Renal blood flow autoregulation Autoregulatory mechanisms help maintain a constant RBF and GFR to protect the kidney from rapid increases or decreases in renal perfusion pressure that could cause renal injury or decrease glomerular filtration. Mechanisms:

Myogenic: arterial pressure stretch of afferent arteriole mechanical activation of vascular smooth muscle vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole RBF.

Tubuloglomerular: NaCl or tonicity of the filtrate sensed by macula densa cells paracrine- driven vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole RBF.

Effective renal plasma flow (eRPF) can be estimated using para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance. Between filtration and secretion, there is nearly complete excretion of all PAH that enters the kidney. eRPF = UPAH × V/PPAH = CPAH. Renal blood flow (RBF) = RPF/(1 − Hct). Usually 20–25% of cardiac output. eRPF underestimates true renal plasma flow (RPF) slightly.

Glucose at a normal plasma level (range 60–120 mg/dL) is completely reabsorbed in proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) by Na+/glucose cotransport.

Glucose clearance

In adults, at plasma glucose of ∼ 200 mg/dL, glucosuria begins (threshold). At rate of ∼ 375 mg/min, all transporters are fully saturated (Tm). Normal pregnancy is associated with GFR. With filtration of all substances, including glucose, the glucose threshold occurs at lower plasma glucose concentrations glucosuria at normal plasma glucose levels.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (eg, -flozin drugs) result in glucosuria at plasma concentrations < 200 mg/dL.

Glucosuria is an important clinical clue to

diabetes mellitus. Splay phenomenon—Tm for glucose is reached gradually rather than sharply due to the heterogeneity of nephrons (ie, different Tm points); represented by the portion of the titration curve between threshold and Tm.

Hydronephrosis

Hydronephrosis

Distention/dilation of renal pelvis and/or calyces A . Usually caused by urinary tract obstruction (eg, renal stones, severe BPH, congenital obstructions, locally advanced cervical cancer, injury to ureter); other causes include retroperitoneal fibrosis, vesicoureteral reflux. Dilation occurs proximal to site of pathology. Serum creatinine becomes elevated if obstruction is bilateral or if patient has an obstructed solitary kidney. Leads to compression and possible atrophy of renal cortex and medulla.

Urinary incontinence Mixed incontinence has features of both stress and urgency incontinence.

Inflammation of urinary bladder. Presents as suprapubic pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency. Systemic signs (eg, high fever, chills) are usually absent.
======================================
Acute cystitis

Risk factors include female sex (short urethra), sexual intercourse, indwelling catheter, diabetes mellitus, impaired bladder emptying.

Causes:

E coli (most common) Staphylococcus saprophyticus—seen in sexually active young women (E coli is still more

common in this group)

Klebsiella Proteus mirabilis—urine has ammonia scent

Labs: ⊕ leukocyte esterase. ⊕ nitrites (indicates presence of Enterobacteriaceae). Sterile pyuria (pyuria with ⊝ urine cultures) could suggest urethritis by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Treatment: antibiotics (eg, TMP-SMX, nitrofurantoin).

Pyelonephritis

Acute pyelonephritis

Neutrophils infiltrate renal interstitium A . Affects cortex with relative sparing of glomeruli/vessels.

Presents with fevers, flank pain (costovertebral angle tenderness), nausea/vomiting, chills.

Causes include ascending UTI (E coli is most common), hematogenous spread to kidney. Presents

with WBCs in urine +/− WBC casts. CT would show striated parenchymal enhancement.

Risk factors include indwelling urinary catheter, urinary tract obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy (progesterone-mediated in uterine tone and compression by gravid uterus).

Complications include chronic pyelonephritis, renal papillary necrosis, perinephric abscess (with possible posterior spread to adjacent psoas muscle), urosepsis.

Treatment: antibiotics.

Chronic pyelonephritis

The result of recurrent or inadequately treated episodes of acute pyelonephritis. Typically requires predisposition to infection such as vesicoureteral reflux or chronically obstructing kidney stones. Coarse, asymmetric corticomedullary scarring, blunted calyces. Tubules can contain eosinophilic casts resembling thyroid tissue B (thyroidization of kidney).

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis—rare; grossly orange nodules that can mimic tumor nodules; characterized by widespread kidney damage due to granulomatous tissue containing foamy macrophages. Associated with Proteus infection.

======================================
Acute interstitial nephritis

Also called tubulointerstitial nephritis. Acute interstitial renal inflammation. Pyuria (classically eosinophils) and azotemia occurring after administration of drugs that act as haptens, inducing hypersensitivity (eg, diuretics, NSAIDs, penicillin derivatives, proton pump inhibitors, rifampin, quinolones, sulfonamides). Less commonly may be 2° to other processes such as systemic infections (eg, Mycoplasma) or autoimmune diseases (eg, Sjögren syndrome, SLE, sarcoidosis).

Associated with fever, rash, pyuria, hematuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness, but can be asymptomatic.

Acute tubular necrosis

Most common cause of acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients. Spontaneously resolves in many cases. Can be fatal, especially during initial oliguric phase. FENa. Key finding: granular casts (often muddy brown in appearance) A . 3 stages:

1. Inciting event 2. Maintenance phase—oliguric; lasts 1–3 weeks; risk of hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis,

uremia

3. Recovery phase—polyuric; BUN and serum creatinine fall; risk of hypokalemia and renal wasting of other electrolytes and minerals

Can be caused by ischemic or nephrotoxic injury:

Ischemic—2° to renal blood flow (eg, prerenal azotemia). Results in death of tubular cells that may slough into tubular lumen B (PT and thick ascending limb are highly susceptible to injury).

Nephrotoxic—2° to injury resulting from toxic substances (eg, aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents, lead, cisplatin, ethylene glycol), myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), hemoglobinuria. PTs are particularly susceptible to injury.

Diffuse cortical necrosis

Acute generalized cortical infarction of both kidneys. Likely due to a combination of vasospasm and DIC.

Associated with obstetric catastrophes (eg, placental abruption), septic shock.

Renal papillary necrosis

Associated with:

Sloughing of necrotic renal papillae A gross hematuria. May be triggered by recent infection or immune stimulus.

Sickle cell disease or trait Acute pyelonephritis Analgesics (eg, NSAIDs) Diabetes mellitus

SAAD papa with papillary necrosis.
======================================
Consequences of renal failure

2 forms of renal failure: acute (eg, ATN) and chronic (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congenital anomalies).

Decline in renal filtration can lead to excess retained nitrogenous waste products and electrolyte disturbances.

Consequences (MAD HUNGER):

Incremental reductions in GFR define the stages of chronic kidney disease.

Metabolic Acidosis Dyslipidemia (especially triglycerides) High potassium Uremia Na+/H2O retention (HF, pulmonary edema,

Normal phosphate levels are maintained during early stages of CKD due to levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which promotes renal excretion of phosphate. “FGF23 fights f(ph)osphate.”

hypertension)

Uremia—syndrome resulting from high serum urea. Can present with Pericarditis, Encephalopathy (seen with asterixis), Anorexia, Nausea (pronounce “Ure-PEAN” [European]).

Growth retardation and developmental delay Erythropoietin deficiency (anemia) Renal osteodystrophy

High serum phosphate can bind with Ca2+ tissue deposits serum Ca2+. 1,25-(OH)2D3 intestinal Ca2+ absorption. Causes subperiosteal thinning of bones.

Renal cyst disorders

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease

Numerous cysts in cortex and medulla A causing bilateral enlarged kidneys ultimately destroy

kidney parenchyma. Presents with combinations of flank pain, hematuria, hypertension, urinary infection, progressive renal failure in ~ 50% of individuals.

Mutation in genes encoding polycystin protein: PKD1 (85% of cases, chromosome 16) or PKD2

(15% of cases, chromosome 4). Complications include chronic kidney disease and hypertension (caused by renin production). Associated with berry aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, benign hepatic cysts, diverticulosis.
======================================
Treatment: If hypertension or proteinuria develops, treat with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease

—

in infancy, and may be seen on prenatal ultrasound. Associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis. Significant oliguric renal failure in utero can lead to Potter sequence. Concerns beyond neonatal period include systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and portal hypertension from congenital hepatic fibrosis.

Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease

Also called medullary cystic kidney disease. Causes tubulointerstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency with inability to concentrate urine. Medullary cysts usually not visualized; smaller kidneys on ultrasound. Poor prognosis.

Simple vs complex renal cysts

Simple cysts are filled with ultrafiltrate (anechoic on ultrasound). Very common and account for

majority of all renal masses. Found incidentally and typically asymptomatic.

Complex cysts, including those that are septated, enhanced, or have solid components on imaging

require follow-up or removal due to possibility of renal cell carcinoma.

For unilateral RAS, affected kidney can atrophy

asymmetric kidney size. Renal venous sampling will show renin in affected kidney, renin in unaffected kidney.

For bilateral RAS, patients can have a sudden rise in creatinine after starting an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or renin inhibitor, due to their interference on RAAS-mediated renal perfusion.

Can present with severe/refractory HTN, flash pulmonary edema, epigastric/flank bruit. Patients with RAS may also have stenosis in other large vessels.

Polygonal clear cells A filled with accumulated lipids and carbohydrate. Often golden-yellow B due to lipid content.

Associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, eg, PTHrP, Ectopic EPO, ACTH, Renin (“PEAR”-aneoplastic). Clear cell (most common subtype) associated with gene deletion on chromosome 3 (sporadic, or inherited as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome).

Originates from PCT invades renal vein

(may develop varicocele if left sided) IVC hematogenous spread metastasis to lung and bone.

Manifests with flank pain, palpable mass, hematuria (classic triad) as well as anemia, 2º polycythemia (less common), fever, weight loss.

RCC = 3 letters = chromosome 3 = associated with VHL (also 3 letters).

Treatment: surgery/ablation for localized disease. Immunotherapy (eg, ipilimumab) or targeted therapy for metastatic disease, rarely curative. Resistant to radiation and chemotherapy.

Organizing the reproductive system by key concepts such as embryology, endocrinology, pregnancy, and oncology can help with understanding this complex topic. Study the endocrine and reproductive chapters together, because mastery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is key to answering questions on ovulation, menstruation, disorders of sexual development, contraception, and many pathologies.

Embryology is a nuanced subject that spans multiple organ systems. Approach it from a clinical perspective. For instance, make the connection between the presentation of DiGeorge syndrome and the 3rd/4th pharyngeal pouch, and between the Müllerian/Wolffian systems and disorders of sexual development.

As for oncology, don’t worry about remembering screening or treatment guidelines. It is more important to recognize the clinical presentation (eg, signs and symptoms) of reproductive cancers and their associated labs, histopathology, and risk factors. In addition, some of the testicular and ovarian cancers have distinct patterns of hCG, AFP, LH, or FSH derangements that serve as helpful clues in exam questions.

Holoprosencephaly may occur in more severe presentations. One mechanism is due to impaired migration of neuronal and glial cells.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome Complex disorder involving CNS, ANS, and GI systems. 2° to maternal substance use (most commonly opioids) during pregnancy. Newborns may present with uncoordinated sucking reflexes, irritability, high-pitched crying, tremors, tachypnea, sneezing, diarrhea, and possibly seizures.

Treatment (for opioid use): methadone, morphine, buprenorphine. Universal screening for substance use is recommended in all pregnant patients.

Umbilical cord

Two umbilical arteries return deoxygenated blood from fetal internal iliac arteries to placenta.

Single umbilical artery (2-vessel cord) is associated with congenital and chromosomal anomalies.

One umbilical vein supplies oxygenated blood from placenta to fetus; drains into IVC via liver or via ductus venosus.

Umbilical arteries and vein are derived from allantois.

Umbilical arteries  Amnion  Umbilical vein  Allantois  Umbilical arteries  Umbilical vein  Wharton jelly 

Urachus

Allantois forms from yolk sac and extends into cloaca. Intra-abdominal remnant of allantois is called the urachus, a duct between fetal bladder and umbilicus. Failure of urachus to involute can lead to anomalies that may increase risk of infection and/or malignancy (eg, adenocarcinoma) if not treated. Obliterated urachus is represented by the median umbilical ligament after birth, which is covered by median umbilical fold of the peritoneum.

Patent urachus Total failure of urachus to obliterate urine discharge from umbilicus.

Urachal cyst

Partial failure of urachus to obliterate; fluid-filled cavity lined with uroepithelium, between

umbilicus and bladder. Cyst can become infected and present as painful mass below umbilicus.

Deviation from normal menstruation volume, duration, frequency, regularity, or intermenstrual bleeding. Causes (PALM-COEIN):

Abnormal uterine bleeding

Terms such as dysfunctional uterine bleeding, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, polymenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea are no longer recommended.

Leiomyoma, Malignancy/hyperplasia Nonstructural: Coagulopathy, Ovulatory, Endometrial, Iatrogenic, Not yet classified

Pregnancy

Fertilization (conception) most commonly occurs in upper end of fallopian tube (the ampulla). Occurs within 1 day of ovulation. Implantation in the uterine wall occurs 6 days after fertilization. Syncytiotrophoblasts secrete hCG, which is detectable in blood 1 week after fertilization and on home urine tests 2 weeks after fertilization. Embryonic/developmental age—time since fertilization. Used in embryology. Gestational age—time since first day of last menstrual period. Used clinically. Gravidity (“gravida”)—number of pregnancies. Parity (“para”)—number of pregnancies that resulted in live births.

Placental hormone secretion generally increases over the course of pregnancy, but hCG peaks at 8–10 weeks of gestation.

Human chorionic gonadotropin

SOURCE

Syncytiotrophoblast of placenta.

Maintains corpus luteum (and thus progesterone) for first 8–10 weeks of gestation by acting like LH (otherwise no luteal cell stimulation abortion). Luteal-placental shift is complete after 8–10 weeks; placenta synthesizes its own estriol and progesterone and corpus luteum degenerates. FUNCTION

Used to detect pregnancy because it appears early in urine (see above). Has identical α subunit as LH, FSH, TSH (states of hCG can cause hyperthyroidism). β subunit

is unique (pregnancy tests detect β subunit). hCG is in multifetal gestation, hydatidiform moles, choriocarcinomas, and Down syndrome; hCG is in ectopic/failing pregnancy, Edwards syndrome, and Patau syndrome.

Human placental lactogen

Also called human chorionic somatomammotropin.

SOURCE

Syncytiotrophoblast of placenta.

FUNCTION

Promotes insulin resistance to supply growing fetus with glucose and amino acids. Concurrently stimulates insulin secretion; inability to overcome insulin resistance gestational diabetes.

After parturition and delivery of placenta, rapid in estrogen and progesterone disinhibits prolactin initiation of lactation. Suckling is required to maintain milk production and ejection, since nerve stimulation oxytocin and prolactin.

Lactation

Prolactin—induces and maintains lactation and reproductive function. Oxytocin—assists in milk letdown; also promotes uterine contractions. Breast milk is the ideal nutrition for infants < 6 months old. Contains immunoglobulins

(conferring passive immunity; mostly IgA), macrophages, lymphocytes. Breast milk reduces infant infections and is associated with risk for child to develop asthma, allergies, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Guidelines recommend exclusively breastfed infants get vitamin D and possibly iron supplementation.

Breastfeeding facilitates bonding with the child. Breastfeeding or donating milk risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

Hormonal changes: estrogen, FSH, LH (no surge), GnRH. Causes HAVOCS: Hot flashes (most common), Atrophy of the Vagina, Osteoporosis, Coronary artery disease, Sleep disturbances. Menopause before age 40 suggests 1° ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure); may occur in females who have received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Menopause Diagnosed by amenorrhea for 12 months. estrogen production due to age-linked decline in number of ovarian follicles. Average age at onset is 51 years (earlier in people who smoke tobacco).

Usually preceded by 4–5 years of abnormal

menstrual cycles. Source of estrogen (estrone) after menopause becomes peripheral conversion of androgens, androgens hirsutism.

FSH is specific for menopause (loss of

negative feedback on FSH due to estrogen).

Tanner stages of sexual development

Tanner stage is assigned independently to genitalia, pubic hair, and breast (eg, a person can have Tanner stage 2 genitalia, Tanner stage 3 pubic hair). Earliest detectable secondary sexual characteristic is breast bud development in females, testicular enlargement in males.

Stage I  Stage II  Stage III  Stage IV  Stage V  Coarse hair across pubis and  medial thigh Penis and testis enlarge to  adult size Adult breast contour, areola  ﬂattens  Coarse hair across pubis,  sparing thigh  Penis width/glans Breast enlarges, raised  areola, mound on mound         No sexual hair Flat-appearing chest with  raised nipple  Pubic hair appears (pubarche) Testicular enlargement  Breast bud forms (thelarche), mound forms  Coarsening of pubic  hair Penis size/length  Breast enlarges             Pre-pubertal  ~ 8–11.5 years  ~ 11.5–13 years  ~ 13–15 years  Usually > 15 years 

Precocious puberty

Appearance of 2° sexual characteristics (eg, pubarche, thelarche) before age 8 years in females and 9 years in males. sex hormone exposure or production linear growth, somatic and skeletal maturation (eg, premature closure of epiphyseal plates short stature). Types include: Central precocious puberty ( GnRH secretion): idiopathic (most common; early activation of

hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis), CNS tumors.

Peripheral precocious puberty (GnRH-independent; sex hormone production or exposure to exogenous sex steroids): congenital adrenal hyperplasia, estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor (eg, granulosa cell tumor), Leydig cell tumor, McCune-Albright syndrome.
======================================
Delayed puberty

Absence of 2° sexual characteristics by age 13 years in females and 14 years in males. Causes:

Hypergonadotropic (1°) hypogonadism: Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, gonadal injury (eg, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, infection).

Hypogonadotropic (2°) hypogonadism: constitutional delay of growth and puberty (“late blooming”), Kallmann syndrome, CNS lesions.

Diagnosing disorders by physical characteristics

Aromatase deficiency Inability to synthesize endogenous estrogens. Autosomal recessive. During fetal life, DHEA produced by fetal adrenal glands cannot be converted to estrogen by the placenta and is converted to testosterone peripherally virilization of both female infant (atypical genitalia) and mother (acne, hirsutism; fetal androgens can cross placenta).

Defect in androgen receptor resulting in female-appearing genetic male (46,XY DSD); female external genitalia with scant axillary and pubic hair, rudimentary vagina; uterus and fallopian tubes absent due to persistence of anti-Müllerian hormone from testes. Patients develop normal functioning testes (often found in labia majora; surgically removed to prevent malignancy). testosterone, estrogen, LH (vs sex chromosome disorders).

5αα-reductase deficiency Autosomal recessive; sex limited to genetic males (46,XY DSD). Inability to convert testosterone to DHT. Atypical genitalia until puberty, when testosterone causes masculinization/ growth of external genitalia. Testosterone/estrogen levels are normal; LH is normal or . Internal genitalia are normal.

Kallmann syndrome Failure to complete puberty; a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Defective migration of neurons and subsequent failure of olfactory bulbs to develop synthesis of GnRH in the hypothalamus; hyposmia/anosmia; GnRH, FSH, LH, testosterone. Infertility (low sperm count in males; amenorrhea in females).

Placental disorders

Myometrium  Serosa  Endometrium  Normal placenta  Placenta accreta  Placenta increta  Placenta percreta 

Placenta accreta spectrum

Abnormal invasion of trophoblastic tissue into uterine wall A . Risk factors: prior C-section or other uterine surgery (areas of uterine scarring impair normal decidualization), placenta previa, maternal age, multiparity. Three types depending on depth of trophoblast invasion: Placenta accreta—attaches to myometrium

(instead of overlying decidua basalis) without invading it. Most common type.

Placenta increta—partially invades into myometrium.

Placenta percreta—completely invades (“perforates”) through myometrium and serosa, sometimes extending into adjacent organs (eg, bladder hematuria). Presents with difficulty separating placenta from uterus after fetal delivery and severe postpartum hemorrhage upon attempted manual removal of placenta (often extracted in pieces).
======================================
Placenta

Placenta previa Attachment of placenta over internal cervical os (a “preview” of the placenta is visible through cervix). Risk factors: prior C-section, multiparity.

Presents with painless vaginal bleeding in third trimester. Low-lying placenta—located < 2 cm from, but not covering, the internal cervical os.

Vasa previa Fetal vessels run over, or < 2 cm from, the internal cervical os. Risk factors: velamentous insertion of umbilical cord (inserts in chorioamniotic membrane rather than placenta fetal vessels travel to placenta unprotected by Wharton jelly), bilobed or succenturiate placenta.

Presents with painless vaginal bleeding (fetal blood from injured vessels) upon rupture of membranes accompanied by fetal heart rate abnormalities (eg, bradycardia). May lead to fetal death from exsanguination.

Placental abruption

Also called abruptio placentae. Premature separation of placenta from uterus prior to fetal delivery. Risk factors: maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, smoking, cocaine use, abdominal trauma. Presents with abrupt, painful vaginal bleeding in third trimester; can lead to maternal hypovolemic shock (due to hemorrhage) and DIC (due to release of tissue factor from injured placenta), fetal distress (eg, hypoxia). May be life threatening for both mother and fetus.

Greater-than-expected blood loss after delivery. Leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Etiology (4 T’s): Tone (uterine atony soft, boggy uterus; most common), Trauma (eg, lacerations, incisions, uterine rupture), Tissue (retained products of conception), Thrombin (coagulopathy). Treatment: uterine massage, oxytocin. If refractory, surgical ligation of uterine or internal iliac arteries (fertility is preserved since ovarian arteries provide collateral circulation).

Most common adnexal mass in females > 55 years old. Present with abdominal distention, bowel obstruction, pleural effusion.

Risk with advanced age, number of lifetime ovulations (early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity), endometriosis, genetic predisposition (eg, BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, Lynch syndrome).

Risk with previous pregnancy, history of breastfeeding, OCPs, tubal ligation. Epithelial tumors are typically serous (lined by serous epithelium natively found in fallopian tubes, and often bilateral) or mucinous (lined by mucinous epithelium natively found in cervix). Monitor response to therapy/relapse by measuring CA 125 levels (not good for screening).

Germ cell tumors can differentiate into somatic structures (eg, teratomas), or extra-embryonic structures (eg, yolk sac tumors), or can remain undifferentiated (eg, dysgerminoma).

Sex cord stromal tumors develop from embryonic sex cord (develops into theca and granulosa cells of follicle, Sertoli and Leydig cells of seminiferous tubules) and stromal (ovarian cortex) derivatives.

Penile pathology

Abnormal curvature of penis A due to fibrous plaque within tunica albuginea. Associated with repeated minor trauma during intercourse. Can cause pain, anxiety, erectile dysfunction. Consider surgical repair or treatment with collagenase injections once curvature stabilizes. Distinct from penile fracture (rupture of tunica albuginea due to forced bending).

Peyronie disease

Ischemic priapism Painful sustained erection lasting > 4 hours. Associated with sickle cell disease (sickled RBCs block venous drainage of corpus cavernosum vascular channels), medications (eg, sildenafil, trazodone). Treat immediately with corporal aspiration, intracavernosal phenylephrine, or surgical decompression to prevent ischemia.

Squamous cell carcinoma Seen in the US, but more common in Asia, Africa, South America. Most common type of penile cancer B . Precursor in situ lesions: Bowen disease (in penile shaft, presents as leukoplakia “white plaque”), erythroplasia of Queyrat (carcinoma in situ of the glans, presents as erythroplakia “red plaque”), Bowenoid papulosis (carcinoma in situ of unclear malignant potential, presenting as reddish papules). Associated with uncircumcised males and HPV-16. B

Cryptorchidism A

Descent failure of one A or both testes. Impaired spermatogenesis (since sperm develop best at temperatures < 37°C) subfertility. Can have normal testosterone levels (Leydig cells are mostly unaffected by temperature). Associated with risk of germ cell tumors. Prematurity risk of cryptorchidism. inhibin B, FSH, LH; testosterone in bilateral cryptorchidism, normal in unilateral. Most cases resolve spontaneously; otherwise, orchiopexy performed before 2 years of age.

Testicular torsion Rotation of testicle around spermatic cord and vascular pedicle. Commonly presents in males 12–18 years old. Associated with congenital inadequate fixation of testis to tunica vaginalis horizontal positioning of testes (“bell clapper” deformity). May occur after an inciting event (eg, trauma) or spontaneously. Characterized by acute, severe pain, high-riding testis, and absent cremasteric reflex. ⊝ Prehn sign.

Treatment: surgical correction (orchiopexy) within 6 hours, manual detorsion if surgical option unavailable in timeframe. If testis is not viable, orchiectomy. Orchiopexy, when performed, should be bilateral because the contralateral testis is at risk for subsequent torsion.

Dilated veins in pampiniform plexus due to venous pressure; most common cause of scrotal enlargement in adult males. Most often on left side because of resistance to flow from left gonadal vein drainage into left renal vein. Right-sided varicocele may indicate IVC obstruction (eg, from RCC invading right renal vein). Can cause infertility because of temperature. Diagnosed by standing clinical exam/Valsalva maneuver (distension on inspection and “bag of worms” on palpation; augmented by Valsalva) or ultrasound A . Does not transilluminate.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Seminal vesicle  Ampulla of  vas deferens  Peripheral zone  Central zone  Transition zone  Fibromuscular zone  Urethra 

Common in males > 50 years old. Characterized by smooth, elastic, firm nodular enlargement (hyperplasia not hypertrophy) of transition zone, which compress the urethra into a vertical slit. Not premalignant.

Often presents with t frequency of urination,

nocturia, difficulty starting and stopping urine stream, dysuria. May lead to distention and hypertrophy of bladder, hydronephrosis, UTIs. total PSA, with fraction of free PSA. PSA is made by prostatic epithelium stimulated by androgens. Treatment: α1-antagonists (terazosin, tamsulosin), which cause relaxation of smooth muscle; 5α-reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride); PDE-5 inhibitors (eg, tadalafil); surgical resection (eg, TURP, ablation).

Prostatitis

Prostatitis

Characterized by dysuria, frequency, urgency, low back pain. Warm, tender, enlarged prostate. Acute bacterial prostatitis—in older males most common bacterium is E coli; in young males consider C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae.

Chronic prostatitis—either bacterial or nonbacterial (eg, 2° to previous infection, nerve problems, chemical irritation).

Prostatic adenocarcinoma

prostate gland and is most frequently diagnosed by PSA and subsequent needle core biopsies (transrectal, ultrasound-guided). Histologically graded using Gleason grade, which is based on glandular architecture and correlates closely with metastatic potential. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and PSA are useful tumor markers ( total PSA, with fraction of free PSA). Osteoblastic metastases in bone may develop in late stages, as indicated by lower back pain and serum ALP and PSA. Metastasis to the spine often occurs via Batson (vertebral) venous plexus.

Respiration impossible, incompatible with life.

Canalicular (weeks 16–25)

Terminal bronchioles respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts. Surrounded by prominent capillary network.

Airways increase in diameter. Pneumocytes develop starting at week 20. Respiration capable at week 25.

Saccular (week 24–birth)

Alveolar ducts terminal sacs. Terminal sacs

separated by 1° septae.

Alveolar (week 36–8 years)

Terminal sacs adult alveoli (due to 2°

septation).

In utero, “breathing” occurs via aspiration and expulsion of amniotic fluid pulmonary vascular resistance through gestation. At birth, air replaces fluid pulmonary

vascular resistance.

Respiratory tree

Conducting zone

Large airways consist of nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Airway resistance highest in the large- to medium-sized bronchi. Small airways consist of bronchioles that further divide into terminal bronchioles (large numbers in parallel least airway resistance).

Warms, humidifies, and filters air but does not participate in gas exchange “anatomic dead space.” Cartilage and goblet cells extend to the end of bronchi. Pseudostratified ciliated columnar cells primarily make up epithelium of bronchus and extend to

beginning of terminal bronchioles, then transition to cuboidal cells. Clear mucus and debris from lungs (mucociliary escalator).

Airway smooth muscle cells extend to end of terminal bronchioles (sparse beyond this point).

Respiratory zone Lung parenchyma; consists of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Participates in gas exchange.

Mostly cuboidal cells in respiratory bronchioles, then simple squamous cells up to alveoli. Cilia terminate in respiratory bronchioles. Alveolar macrophages clear debris and participate in immune response.

Refers to the energy expended or O2 consumed by respiratory muscles to produce the ventilation needed to meet the body’s metabolic demand. Comprises the work needed to overcome both elastic recoil and airway resistance (ie, work = force × distance = pressure × volume). Minimized by optimizing respiratory rate (RR) and VT. in restrictive diseases ( work to overcome elastic recoil achieved with RR and VT) and obstructive diseases ( work to overcome airway resistance achieved with RR and VT).

Pulmonary circulation Normally a low-resistance, high-compliance

system. A in Pao2 causes hypoxic vasoconstriction that shifts blood away from poorly ventilated regions of lung to well- ventilated regions of lung. Perfusion limited—O2 (normal health), CO2, N2O. Gas equilibrates early along the length of the capillary. Exchange can be only if blood flow . Diffusion limited—O2 (emphysema, fibrosis), CO. Gas does not equilibrate by the time blood reaches the end of the capillary. O2 diffuses slowly, while CO2 diffuses very rapidly across the alveolar membrane. Disease states that lead to diffusion limitation (eg, pulmonary fibrosis) are more likely to cause early hypoxia than hypercapnia.

−/Cl− transporter on RBC membrane allows HCO3 plasma and Cl− to diffuse into RBC (chloride shift) via facilitated diffusion countertransport 2 Carbaminohemoglobin or HbCO2 (21–25%). CO2 bound to Hb at N-terminus of globin (not

heme). CO2 favors deoxygenated form (O2 unloaded).

3 Dissolved CO2 (5–9%).

In lungs, oxygenation of Hb promotes dissociation of H+ from Hb. This shifts equilibrium toward CO2 formation; therefore, CO2 is released from RBCs (Haldane effect). Majority of blood CO2 is carried as HCO3

Hemoglobin

The protein component of hemoglobin acts as buffer for H+ ions.

Normal adult hemoglobin (Hb) is composed of 4 polypeptide subunits (2 α and 2 β) that each bind one O2 molecule. Hb is an allosteric protein that exhibits positive cooperativity when binding to O2, such that: Oxygenated Hb has high affinity for O2

Myoglobin is composed of a single polypeptide chain associated with one heme moiety. Higher affinity for oxygen than Hb.

(300×).

Deoxygenated Hb has low affinity for O2 promotes release/unloading of O2.

Oxygen content of blood

O2 content = (O2 bound to hemoglobin) + (O2 solubilized in plasma) = (1.34 × Hb × SaO2) + (0.003 × PaO2). SaO2 = percent saturation of arterial blood with O2. 0.003 = solubility constant of O2; PaO2 = partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood. Normally 1 g Hb can bind 1.34 mL O2; normal Hb amount in blood is 15 g/dL. O2 binding (carrying) capacity ≈ 20 mL O2/dL of blood. With Hb there is O2 content of arterial blood, but no change in O2 saturation and Pao2. O2 delivery to tissues = cardiac output × O2 content of blood.

Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve

(ODC) reflect local tissue oxygen needs. Can be helpful (meets metabolic needs) or harmful (in toxicities, pathophysiologic situations). Right shift in ODC reflects Hb affinity for O2 O2 unloading at tissue. Physiologically occurs with O2 needs: exercise, pH, temperature/fever, hypoxia ( 2,3-BPG); at the cellular level, caused by H+ and CO2 created by tissue metabolism (Bohr effect). Left shift in ODC reflects Hb affinity for O2 O2 unloading at tissue. Physiologically occurs with O2 needs ( temperature) and pregnancy (fetal Hb has higher O2 affinity than adult Hb, and O2 binding due to affinity for 2,3-BPG left shift, driving O2 across placenta to fetus). Pathologically occurs with CO, MetHb, genetic mutation ( 2,3- BPG). Left is lower.

======================================
Methemoglobin

Iron in Hb is normally in a reduced state (ferrous Fe2+; “just the 2 of us”). Oxidized form of Hb (ferric, Fe3+) does not bind O2 as readily as Fe2+, but has affinity for cyanide tissue hypoxia from O2 saturation and O2 content. This Fe3+ form is called methemoglobinemia. While typical concentrations are 1–2%, methemoglobinemia will occur at higher levels and may present with cyanosis (does not improve with supplemental O2) and with chocolate-colored blood.

Dapsone, local anesthetics (eg, benzocaine), and nitrites (eg, from dietary intake or polluted water sources) cause poisoning by oxidizing Fe2+ to Fe3+.

Methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue and vitamin C.

Rhinosinusitis  A  Orbit  Max 

Obstruction of sinus drainage into nasal cavity inflammation and pain over affected area. Typically affects maxillary sinuses, which drain against gravity due to ostia located superomedially (red arrow points to fluid-filled right maxillary sinus in A ).

Superior meatus—drains posterior ethmoid; middle meatus—drains frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid; inferior meatus—drains nasolacrimal duct.

Acute rhinosinusitis is most commonly caused by viruses (eg, rhinovirus); may lead to superimposed bacterial infection, most commonly nontypeable H influenzae, S pneumoniae, M catarrhalis. Paranasal sinus infections may extend to the orbits, cavernous sinus, and brain, causing complications (eg, orbital cellulitis, cavernous sinus syndrome, meningitis).

Epistaxis

Nose bleed. Most commonly occurs in anterior segment of nostril (Kiesselbach plexus). Life- threatening hemorrhages occur in posterior segment (sphenopalatine artery, a branch of maxillary artery). Common causes include foreign body, trauma, allergic rhinitis, and nasal angiofibromas (common in adolescent males).

Kiesselbach drives his Lexus with his LEGS: superior Labial artery, anterior and posterior Ethmoidal arteries, Greater palatine artery, Sphenopalatine artery.

Anterior ethmoid artery  Posterior ethmoid artery  Sphenopalatine artery  Kiesselbach plexus  Greater palatine artery  Superior labial artery 

Head and neck cancer Mostly squamous cell carcinoma. Risk factors include tobacco, alcohol, HPV-16 (oropharyngeal), EBV (nasopharyngeal). Field cancerization: carcinogen damages wide mucosal area multiple tumors that develop independently after exposure.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma may present with unilateral nasal obstruction, discharge, epistaxis. Eustachian tube obstruction may lead to otitis media +/– effusion, hearing loss.

Laryngeal papillomatosis—also called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Benign laryngeal tumor, commonly affecting areas of stratified squamous epithelium such as the true vocal cords, especially in children. Associated with HPV-6 and HPV-11.
======================================
Deep venous thrombosis

Blood clot within a deep vein swelling, redness A , warmth, pain. Predisposed by Virchow triad (SHE): Stasis (eg, post-op, long drive/flight) Hypercoagulability (eg, defect in

coagulation cascade proteins, such as factor V Leiden; oral contraceptive use; pregnancy)

Endothelial damage (exposed collagen triggers clotting cascade)

d-dimer test may be used clinically to rule out DVT if disease probability is low or moderate (high sensitivity, low specificity). Imaging test of choice is compression ultrasound with Doppler. Use unfractionated heparin or low-molecular weight heparins (eg, enoxaparin) for prophylaxis and acute management. Use direct anticoagulants (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban) for treatment and long-term prevention.

Most pulmonary emboli arise from proximal deep veins of lower extremity (iliac, femoral, popliteal veins).

Pulmonary emboli Obstruction of the pulmonary artery or its branches by foreign material (usually thrombus) that mismatch). May present originated elsewhere. Affected alveoli are ventilated but not perfused ( with sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, respiratory alkalosis. Large emboli or saddle embolus (red arrows show filling defects in A ) may cause sudden death due to clot preventing blood from filling LV and increased RV size further compromising LV filling (obstructive shock). CT pulmonary angiography is imaging test of choice for PE (look for filling defects) B . ECG may show sinus tachycardia or, less commonly, S1Q3T3 abnormality. Lines of Zahn C are interdigitating areas of pink (platelets, fibrin) and red (RBCs) found only in

thrombi formed before death; help distinguish pre- and postmortem thrombi.

Treatment: anticoagulation (eg, heparin, direct thrombin/factor Xa inhibitors), IVC filter (if anticoagulation is contraindicated).

Types: Fat, Air, Thrombus, Bacteria, Amniotic fluid, Tumor. An embolus moves like a FAT BAT. Fat emboli—associated with long bone fractures and liposuction; classic triad of hypoxemia, neurologic abnormalities, petechial rash.

Air emboli—nitrogen bubbles precipitate in ascending divers (caisson disease/decompression sickness); treat with hyperbaric O2; or, can be iatrogenic 2° to invasive procedures (eg, central line placement). Amniotic fluid emboli—typically occurs during labor or postpartum, but can be due to uterine trauma. Can lead to DIC. Rare, but high mortality.

Mediastinal pathology Normal mediastinum contains heart, thymus, lymph nodes, esophagus, and aorta.

Mediastinal masses Some pathologies (eg, lymphoma, lung cancer, abscess) can occur in any compartment, but there

are common associations: Anterior—4 T’s: thyroid (substernal goiter), thymic neoplasm, teratoma, “terrible” lymphoma. Middle—metastases, hiatal hernia, bronchogenic cysts. Posterior—esophageal cancer (may present as mass in, or spread to, middle mediastinum),

neurogenic tumor (eg, neurofibroma), multiple myeloma.
======================================
Mediastinitis

Inflammation of mediastinal tissues. Commonly due to postoperative complications of cardiothoracic procedures (≤ 14 days), esophageal perforation, or contiguous spread of odontogenic/retropharyngeal infection.

Chronic mediastinitis—also called fibrosing mediastinitis; due to proliferation of connective

tissue in mediastinum. Histoplasma capsulatum is common cause.

Clinical features: fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, chest pain, and sternal wound drainage.

Pneumomediastinum

Presence of gas (usually air) in the mediastinum. Can either be spontaneous (due to rupture of

pulmonary bleb) or 2° (eg, trauma, iatrogenic, Boerhaave syndrome).

Ruptured alveoli allow tracking of air into the mediastinum via peribronchial and perivascular sheaths. Clinical features: chest pain, dyspnea, voice change, subcutaneous emphysema, ⊕ Hamman sign (crepitus on cardiac auscultation).

Atelectasis

Alveolar collapse (right upper lobe collapse against mediastinum in A ). Multiple causes:

Obstructive—airway obstruction prevents new air from reaching distal airways, old air is resorbed (eg, foreign body, mucous plug, tumor)

Compressive—external compression on lung decreases lung volumes (eg, space-occupying lesion, pleural effusion)

Contraction (cicatrization)—scarring of lung parenchyma that distorts alveoli (eg, sarcoidosis) Adhesive—due to lack of surfactant (eg, NRDS in premature infants)

Decreased via incentive spirometry or PEEP during mechanical ventilation.

Obstruction  Pleura  Lung parenchyma  Scarring  Pleural effusion, air, tumor  Obstructive  Compressive  Contraction  Adhesive 

Pleural effusions

Excess accumulation of fluid A between pleural layers restricted lung expansion during inspiration. Can be treated with thoracentesis to remove/reduce fluid B . Based on the Light’s criteria, fluid is consistent with an exudate if pleural fluid protein/serum protein > 0.5, pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH > 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > 2/3 upper limit of normal serum LDH.

Exudate Cloudy fluid (cellular). Due to infection (eg, pneumonia, tuberculosis), malignancy, connective tissue disease, lymphatic (chylothorax), trauma. Often requires drainage due to risk of infection.

Clear fluid (hypocellular). Due to hydrostatic pressure (eg, HF, Na+ retention) and/or oncotic Transudate pressure (eg, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis).

Lung abscess

Localized collection of pus within parenchyma. Caused by aspiration of oropharyngeal contents (especially in patients predisposed to loss of consciousness [eg, alcohol overuse, epilepsy]) or bronchial obstruction (eg, cancer). Air-fluid levels A often seen on CXR; presence suggests cavitation. Due to anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus) or S aureus.

Lung abscess 2° to aspiration is most often found in right lung. Location depends on patient’s position during aspiration: RLL if upright, RUL or RML if recumbent.

Leading cause of cancer death. Presentation: cough, hemoptysis, bronchial obstruction, wheezing, pneumonic “coin” lesion on CXR or noncalcified nodule on CT. Sites of metastases from lung cancer: liver (jaundice, hepatomegaly), adrenals, bone (pathologic fracture), brain; “Lung ‘mets’ Love affective boneheads and brainiacs.” In the lung, metastases (usually multiple lesions) are more common than 1° neoplasms. Most often from breast, colon, prostate, and bladder cancer.
======================================
Lung cancer

SPHERE of complications: Superior vena cava/ thoracic outlet syndromes, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome, Endocrine (paraneoplastic), Recurrent laryngeal nerve compression (hoarseness), Effusions (pleural or pericardial). Risk factors include tobacco smoking, secondhand smoke, radiation, environmental exposures (eg, radon, asbestos), pulmonary fibrosis, family history. Squamous and small cell carcinomas are sentral (central) and often caused by tobacco smoking. Hamartomas are found incidentally on imaging, appearing as well-circumscribed mass.
======================================
Highly anaplastic undifferentiated tumor. Strong   association with tobacco smoking. May produce hCG   gynecomastia (enlarged breasts). Less responsive to  chemotherapy; removed surgically. Poor prognosis.   Excellent prognosis; metastasis rare. Symptoms due to mass   effect (wheezing) or carcinoid syndrome (flushing, diarrhea).   C  D

Pancoast tumor

Also called superior sulcus tumor. Carcinoma that occurs in the apex of lung A may cause

Pancoast syndrome by invading/compressing local structures.

Compression of locoregional structures may cause array of findings:

Recurrent laryngeal nerve hoarseness Stellate ganglion Horner syndrome (ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) Superior vena cava SVC syndrome Brachiocephalic vein brachiocephalic syndrome (unilateral symptoms) Brachial plexus shoulder pain, sensorimotor deficits (eg, atrophy of intrinsic muscles of the

hand)

Superior vena cava  syndrome  A 

Phrenic nerve hemidiaphragm paralysis (hemidiaphragm elevation on CXR)

Obstruction of the SVC (eg, thrombus,

Jugular venous  distention Upper extremity  venous distention  Thrombus/ obstruction 

tumor) impairs blood drainage from the head (“facial plethora”; note blanching after fingertip pressure in A ), neck (jugular venous distension, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema), and upper extremities (edema). Commonly caused by malignancy (eg, mediastinal mass, Pancoast tumor) and thrombosis from indwelling catheters. Medical emergency. Can raise intracranial pressure (if obstruction is severe) headaches, dizziness, risk of aneurysm/ rupture of intracranial arteries.

` RESPIRATORY—PhARm ACOl OgY
======================================
Dextromethorphan Antitussive (antagonizes NMDA glutamate receptors). Synthetic codeine analog. Has mild opioid effect when used in excess. Naloxone can be given for overdose. Mild abuse potential. May cause serotonin syndrome if combined with other serotonergic agents.

Top-RaTed Review ResouRces

` HOW TO USE THE DATABASE

This section is a database of top-rated basic science review books, sample examination books, websites, apps, and commercial review courses that have been marketed to medical students studying for the USMLE Step 1. For each recommended resource, we list (where applicable) the Title, the First Author (or editor), the Series Name (where applicable), the Current Publisher, the Copyright Year, the Number of Pages, the ISBN, the Approximate List Price, the Format of the resource, and the Number of Test Questions. We also include Summary Comments that describe their style and overall utility for studying. Finally, each recommended resource receives a Rating. Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically by the first author within each Rating group.

A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student evaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as follows:

A+   Excellent for boards review.  A  A−   Very good for boards review; choose among the group.  B+  B   Good, but use only after exhausting better resources.         Fair, but there are many better resources in the discipline; or low- yield subject material.  B− 

The Rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a number of factors, including:

The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1 The appropriateness and accuracy of the material The readability of the text The quality and number of sample questions The quality of written answers to sample questions The cost The quality of the user interface and learning experience, for web and

mobile apps

preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks available for the basic sciences.

Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the country. The summary comments and overall ratings represent a consensus opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited student feedback on any particular resource.

Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that:

Publisher and app store prices change frequently. Retail and online bookstores may set their own prices. New editions and app versions come out frequently, and the quality of

updating varies.

The same book may be reissued through another publisher.

We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit their opinions and ratings of these basic science review materials so that we may update our database. In addition, we ask that publishers and authors submit for evaluation review copies of basic science review books, including new editions and books not included in our database. We also solicit reviews of new books, mobile apps, websites, flash cards, and commercial review courses.

Disclaimer/Conflict of Interest Statement

None of the ratings reflects the opinion or influence of the publisher. All errors and omissions will gladly be corrected if brought to the attention of the authors through our blog at firstaidteam.com. Please note that USMLE-Rx, ScholarRx, and the entire First Aid for the USMLE series are publications by certain authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1; the following ratings are based solely on recommendations from the student authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 as well as data from the student survey and feedback forms.
